      "Taylor Swift's new film, \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d has topped the weekend box office with $33 million in North America",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 This weekend\u2019s box office belonged to two undeniable draws: Taylor Swift and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.",
      "It might have looked like a heavyweight matchup, but Swift\u2019s devoted fanbase once again proved unstoppable with her film \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 with $33 million in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. The AMC Theatres release -- announced only two weeks ago with minimal promotion -- served as a companion piece to Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, packaging music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and profanity-free lyric visuals into an 89-minute experience.",
      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person. But also realize that when you go outside of your comfort zone, it puts him in a certain light. ... Dwayne Johnson is redefining what he can do.\u201d",
      "Beyond the two marquee names, the rest of the weekend lineup offered a wide mix ranging from animated adventures to horror sequels and international releases.",
      "DreamWorks Animation\u2019s family adventure \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie\u201d debuted in fourth place with $5.2 million, expanding the popular Netflix preschool series to the big screen. Warner Bros.\u2019 supernatural thriller \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites\u201d followed in fifth with $4 million, pulling in $458.2 million globally.",
      "In sixth was \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 Infinity Castle,\u201d the latest entry in the hit Japanese anime saga, earning $3.5 million. A re-release of \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d made a splash in seventh with $3.1 million \u2014 a solid return for the 2022 blockbuster ahead of \u201cAvatar: The Fire and Ash\u201d on Dec. 19.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 were \u201cThe Strangers: Chapter 2\u201d with $2.8 million, the IFC dark comedy \u201cGood Boy\u201d with $2.2 million, marking the company's second-best opening weekend ever. \u201cKantara: A Legend \u2013 Chapter 1\u201d with $1.7 million.",
      "Dergarabedian said he's looking forward to October films such as \u201cTron: Ares,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cRoofman,\" starring Channing Tatum.",

      "Fadel Shaker, had been on the run since the bloody street clashes between Sunni Muslim militants and the Lebanese army in June 2013 in the coastal city of Sidon. He was tried in absentia and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2020 for providing support to a \u201cterrorist group.\u201d",
      "On Saturday night, a Lebanese military intelligence force reached one of the entrances of the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh near Sidon and took Shaker, who had been hiding inside the camp for more than 12 years, into custody, two security and two judicial officials said.",
      "The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the handover came after coordination between mediators and officials at the Lebanese Defense Ministry.",
      "The officials said that now that Shaker is being held by Lebanese authorities, the sentences that he received while on the run will be dropped and he will be questioned in preparation to stand trial on new charges of committing crimes against the military.",
      "Shaker had denied in the past playing any role in the clashes in Sidon and said he never advocated bloodshed.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge remained undecided Friday on the treatment and placement plan for a man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and ramming his car into the front gate of her home.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, a 48-year-old from Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism. But in May, Judge Maria Cavalluzzi found him not competent to stand trial after evaluations from two experts. At Friday\u2019s hearing in a Los Angeles court dedicated to mental health cases, she heard arguments on Carwyle's treatment and placement.",
      "Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, spoke on her behalf for the first time, detailing two years of Carwyle\u2019s harassment and stalking, including various failed attempts to make physical contact with the actor.",
      "Cavalluzzi said she leaned toward sending Carwyle to a mental health treatment alternative to imprisonment. She requested another hearing, scheduled for later this month, to hear from a mental health professional before making a final decision.",
      "Prosecutors and Aniston\u2019s attorney will have a chance to weigh in, Cavalluzzi said.",
      "The judge acknowledged Aniston's \u201cvery real\" fear, but she said she can't ignore the opinions of mental health professionals who have evaluated Carwyle and deemed him not a danger to society. The alternative treatment option offers community-based housing, treatment and support services as opposed to incarceration.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, \u201conly feet away from where she was,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Carwyle had a stated and \u201cpersistent delusion\u201d to impregnate Aniston with three children, Berk said, and \u201cthere is simply no way to prevent him from carrying out his delusion if he walks out.\u201d",
      "The prosecution expressed concern that if Carwyle were offered the treatment in Los Angeles, nothing would stop him \u201cfrom traveling those few miles to Ms. Aniston,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Berk and William Donovan, the deputy district attorney, argued Carwyle was a present danger to Aniston and those around her. Berk said he attempted to enter her property twice, but was turned away.",
      "Carwyle\u2019s lawyer, Robert Krauss, said his client qualifies for alternative treatment, arguing that he hasn\u2019t been convicted of violent crimes. Granting him alternative treatment, \u201cis not like giving him a break or showing him leniency,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cIts just one thing and one thing only \u2014 and that is absolute, pure faithfulness of the law.\u201d",
      "Krauss also referenced a report from the probation department, which recommended Carwyle be granted probation and 90 days in jail if convicted, much less than the over three years maximum sentence for his two charges. Carwyle has been in jail since May and, if convicted, could be let out with time served.",

      "When Cavalluzzi asked how she can be sure he won\u2019t walk away from the treatment program \u2014 a stated concern from the prosecution \u2014 Carwyle responded, \u201cYou have my word.\u201d",

      "Donovan argued that a state hospital is a \u201cmuch safer, much more effective place for him to go,\u201d and will offer the treatment Carwyle needs to address his delusions. The prosecution also argued there\u2019s no evidence that Carwyle\u2019s delusions toward Aniston have stopped, even with medication.",

      "The hearing was postponed several times in recent months as Carwyle at first objected to the incompetence finding and asked for an opinion, and both sides sought more time to examine the case.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",

This tragic event is shocking and traumatizing for him and his family \u2014 and he can only imagine how devastating it has been for the family who lost their pet.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had no idea I would ever wake up to this nightmare, and I know the family must feel the same way. To them, please know that my heart is broken for you,\u201d Gibson said in the statement. \u201cI am praying for your healing and for your beloved pet, who never deserved this. I remain committed to facing this matter with honesty, responsibility, and compassion.\u201d",

      "For Taylor Swift\u2019s most dedicated audience, a new album means new opportunities to decode Easter eggs in her lyrics and music videos. The pop superstar\u2019s 12th studio album has no shortage of clever clues and references to her public life and discography. Many are opaque, revealing just enough to inspire a myriad of fan theories. Others are concrete \u2013 explicit names and places worth exploring. Below, you will find a guide to those instances, and how they relate to Swift.",
      "Read on, and happy digging!",
      "Lyric: \u201cThat view of Portofino was on my mind / When you called me at the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e\u201d",

And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.\u201d She and beau Kelce were spotted last year in Lake Como, Italy, but it is unclear if they spent time in nearby Portofino. Additionally, the standard version of her album is available in \u201csweat and vanilla perfume Portofino orange vinyl.\u201d As for the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e? That\u2019s a luxury hotel in Paris.",
      "Lyric: \u201cBe my NY when Hollywood hates me\u201d",
      "Meaning: Both locations make appearances in Swift\u2019s songwriting. Among them: \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d from 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and \u201cWhite Horse\u201d from 2008\u2019s \u201cFearless.\u201d She also owns property in both locations.",
      "Lyric: \u201cBabe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust \u2026 just kidding\u201d",
      "Meaning: In August of this year, Swift announced her engagement to Kelce by posting a carousel of images on Instagram. Eagle-eyed fans noticed that the ring wasn\u2019t the only jewelry she was showing off. She was also wearing a Cartier watch.",
      "Lyric: \u201cWe hit the best booth at Musso & Frank\u2019s\u201d",
      "Meaning: Since opening in 1919, Musso & Frank Grill has been a hot spot for celebrities in Los Angeles \u2013 embodying the kind of old school Hollywood glamor that inspired \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d artwork.",

      "Lyric: \u201cBut as the 50 Cent song played\u201d",
      "Meaning: A 50 Cent reference further implies this song is rooted in Swift\u2019s teen years in the \u201900s, when the rapper was at the height of his popularity. The song also mentions \u201cprom\u201d and \u201csecond period,\u201d what is typically associated with high school.",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's 12th album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" shows she's still at the top of the cultural mainstream",
      "Who is Taylor Swift\u2019s heir apparent? Her 12th album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d offers an answer. It\u2019s Taylor Swift.",
      "Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d ended with the cautionary \u201cClara Bow,\u201d an allegory that seemed to suggest her tenure atop the cultural mainstream was inherited from stars of the past, like the namechecked Stevie Nicks \u2014 and that a new generation of younger, elastic female pop performers could soon take her place. In 2025, there are many to choose from: Consider Chappell Roan\u2019s full-throated theatrics, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s fiery punk-pop feminism, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s cheeky sexuality. In the knotty themes of Friday's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d best illustrated in the title track, Swift asserts that the baton hasn\u2019t been passed, but rather shared. Because she isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
      "\u201cAnd all the headshots on the walls / Of the dance halls are of the b------ / Who wish I\u2019d hurry up and die,\u201d she sings with a wink, \u201cBut I\u2019m immortal now, baby dolls / I couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d Notably, if she has a chosen successor in someone else, it\u2019s the album\u2019s sole feature: Carpenter, who sings on the stomp-clap closer in her newly adopted twang. The mournful glissando of lap steel \u2014 the album\u2019s most country moment \u2014 arrives only with Carpenter\u2019s introduction. The western genre is Swift\u2019s past and Carpenter\u2019s future.",
      "If Swift is co-signing Carpenter, she\u2019s also learning from her. Carpenter has cornered the market on tight pop songs with pert, provocative messages; Swift does the same with the manspreading swagger of the George Michael-interpolating \u201cFather Figure,\u201d which mentions a protege, and the funky \u201cWood.\u201d (A carefully veiled PG-13 lyric: \u201cHis love was the key / That opened my thighs,\u201d she sings. \u201cGirls, I don\u2019t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way.\u201d) Interwoven are suggestive, sensual ad-libs ... and a direct reference to fiance Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
      "Across a brisk 12 tracks \u2014 Swift\u2019s tendency toward abundance doesn\u2019t manifest itself in a double album this time around, but instead in her endless vinyl variants \u2014 \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d mostly delivers on its promise of up-tempo pop \u201cbangers,\u201d to borrow her own vernacular. Fans need not wait up for the long-anticipated \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d because \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d pulls from its essence. But this time, with a lot of affection, like a truer \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "Swift has long internalized criticisms and responded to them in her art, most directly in 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d Here, she is once again concerned with her perception, articulated over booming, lush production on \u201cCANCELLED!\u201d or \u201cElizabeth Taylor.\u201d On the latter, she sings, \u201cHollywood hates me / You\u2019re only as hot as your last hit, baby.\u201d Except this time, her love acts as an anchor. \u201cI can\u2019t have fun if I can\u2019t have you,\u201d she flirts.",
      "For \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d Swift enlisted Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, the hitmaking duo she collaborated with on 2012\u2019s \u201cRed,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and, of course, \u201cReputation.\u201d Notably absent is her frequent producing partner Jack Antonoff. It\u2019s a wise decision: In years past, Swift, Shellback and Martin\u2019s pop experiments shifted not only her career trajectory but the genre itself. Before \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an EDM drop in the middle of a radio pop hit was unimaginable. After, the style would dominate for half the decade.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d isn\u2019t as seismic, but there are addictive and idiosyncratic Swiftisms here: acerbic wit and thick literary references in glassy pop hooks. Where a song like \u201cOpalite,\u201d if attempted by another other performer, would lose its weightlessness under its voluble aspirations, Swift manages to swoon. Stacked, opalescent harmonies and a vintage swing give the song, fittingly, an almost iridescent quality.",
      "And there are bops, like the undeniable opener \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d with its 1980s-via-Robyn synth-pop and momentary \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d vocal delivery.",
      "There\u2019s a treasure trove of deliciously quotable lines, too, as expected. \u201cPlease God bring me a best friend who I think is hot,\u201d she manages to make effortless in the \u201cMidnights\u201d-esque \u201cWi$h Li$t,\u201d a lovely song about the mundanity of romance and the suburban fantasy of \u201ca couple kids \u2026 a driveway with a basketball hoop.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s dense vocabulary is on full display, often full of charm. But it is sometimes unwieldy, a common criticism of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d like when she overstuffs \u201cOur thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions\u201d into \u201cFather Figure,\u201d momentarily overvaluing clever writing over clever cadence.",

      "Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is",
      "Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d isn\u2019t what you think it is, especially if you think it\u2019s a movie about a British guy who thinks his typewriter is the tops.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is. It\u2019s the solo directorial debut of the younger Safdie, whose films with his brother, Josh, have rarely not sprinted headlong into unsettling tumult. Add that sensibility to a true-life tale of a mixed martial arts fighter in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s only natural to spend much of \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bracing for tragedy, for some ear-splitting descent into macho calamity.",
      "Yet \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, is something simpler and less curious. A lack of probing was never anything you could accuse a Safdie brothers\u2019 movie of; these are the filmmakers who plunged a camera into the body cavity of a jewelry-store owner in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d But, despite its grainy, VHS aesthetics, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is a surprisingly conventional and oddly untroubled movie, albeit one that gives Johnson an indie-film platform for one of his finest performances.",
      "As Mark, Johnson has drained away much of his big-screen charisma. The part \u2014 brawny, often shirtless, frequently raging in the ring \u2014 is immediately so close to Johnson\u2019s own professional wrestling background that early scenes look almost documentary-like. But gone is the megawatt grin and the dashing eyebrow lift. Johnson\u2019s normally polished bald head is here covered with a closely cropped dark head of hair.",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening, Mark rhapsodizes about his feeling of domination. An opponent\u2019s fear, he says, you can \u201csmell in their scent.\u201d At this point, Mark has known only victory in thumping triumphs that leave him feeling like a god. Losing, he confesses, is unfathomable.",
      "The laws of moviedom decree, of course, that Mark will soon lose, and his well-earned sense of invincibility will shatter. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bounces between Mark\u2019s home and Japan, where the Pride Fighting Championship takes place. That\u2019s where Mark, a much-celebrated champion, is taken down by an illegal but nevertheless humbling move. After the fact, the match is ruled a tie, but the stink of defeat never dissipates.",
      "The real battle, in any case, is at home. Mark\u2019s dependence on opioids for the punishing extremes he endures is becoming desperate. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is based on John Hyams\u2019s 2002 documentary of the same name, and part of the nature of that film was the curiosity of Mark\u2019s extreme violence in the ring and his otherwise sweet passivity. In Safdie\u2019s film, Mark is asked in the doctor\u2019s waiting room if fighters hate each other during a bout. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replies.",
      "But while we don\u2019t doubt Mark\u2019s sincerity \u2014 he\u2019s as earnest as he is muscle-bound \u2014 Johnson also exudes an inner turmoil, and a struggle to keep his rage at bay while nursing mounting wounds to his ego. His body is so stiff, it\u2019s like he could snap at any moment.",

      "It\u2019s an awkward, perhaps judgmental characterization that would be all the more glaring if it weren\u2019t for Blunt\u2019s tact as a performer. But it throws \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d off course, especially when the movie seems to want to lean more on its other central relationship: that of Mark and his friend, trainer and sometimes competitor Mark Coleman (played by former Bellator champion Ryan Bader).",

Bader gives \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d a dose of documentary in his presence, but I\u2019d argue that Johnson\u2019s proximity to this world gives the movie its most compelling real-life echoes.",
      "I happen to think Johnson is also very good in full movie-star mode, especially when he has the chance to wryly undercut his big-screen presence in comedies like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d or \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But it\u2019s also captivating to see him so thoroughly settled into a character like he is in \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d while totally shorn of his charisma.",
      "Yet the potency of that performance is let down by a movie that fails to really grapple with the violent world around Mark, resorting instead for a blander appreciation of these MMA combatants. What does resonate, though, is the portrait of a human colossus who learns to accept defeat \u2014 a mountain of a man who looks like he could, without barely trying, rip someone\u2019s head off at any moment. Instead he takes a deep breath, and doesn\u2019t.",

      "NEW YORK -- In 1983, six thieves muscled their way into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, expecting to find a large sum of foreign currency. They got much more than they bargained for \u2014 26 million pounds worth of gold bars.",
      "What happened in the days and years next is the subject of PBS\u2019 \u201cMasterpiece\u201d enthralling series \u201cThe Gold,\u201d which traces the ripple effects of Britain's biggest robbery, going from a local search to infiltrating an international money laundering cartel. It starts airing Sunday.",
      "\u201cFrom the minute the show starts, the pressure's on,\u201d says showrunner Neil Forsyth. \u201cThere\u2019s a clock ticking, there\u2019s a net tightening and all these things. So it\u2019s lovely to write characters under that continual pressure.\u201d",
      "The so-called Brinks-Mat heist rocked Britain, leading to changes in banking laws, policing and shining a light on official corruption. Much of the gold was never located. It was melted down and sold back into the financial system, with the proceeds laundered into real estate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s literally in the bricks and mortar and the architecture that surrounds people everywhere,\u201d says Emun Elliott, who plays one of the detectives. \u201cThere might be a piece of that stolen gold in your wedding ring. It is everywhere.\u201d",
      "To tell the sprawling story of \u201cThe Gold,\u201d Forsyth streamlined timelines, combined real-life figures and adjusted events to fit the drama. Viewers are told the series was \u201cinspired by real events.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a strict factual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t find that a very attractive route to go down creatively because I like having the space to create and that\u2019s extremely important if you\u2019re going to create something that\u2019s truly entertaining, truly gripping.\u201d",
      "One real person who is portrayed in the series is Brian Boyce, the principled and determined lead investigator, played by \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d star Hugh Bonneville.",
      "Boyce \u201cwas known to be a safe pair of hands,\u201d says Bonneville, who met the retired officer to prepare for the role. Boyce knew some officers in the department were corrupt and picked a lean, insular team to track down the gold and money.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely was adamant that not on his watch would police corruption thrive,\u201d Bonneville says. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man of integrity and I think that comes through. You\u2019ve got him against all odds trying to steer a level course and get this job done.\u201d",
      "Forsyth says the series' first episode attracted some 10 million viewers in the U.K. \u2014 or 1 in 5 of the adult population. He says he was in a restaurant with his wife once when the nearby table spent the whole meal discussing it, which was \u201csomewhat unnerving.\u201d",
      "Forsyth was only 5 and living in Scotland at the time of what he calls the \u201ciconic heist.\u201d Despite its impact on British society, no one had pieced it all together in a dramatization or an all-encompassing documentary until now.",

      "Eight years ago, the great Daniel Day-Lewis said he was finished with acting",
      "It is often said of our greatest actors that they could compellingly recite the phone book.",
      "There's no doubt, just to continue that thought for a moment, that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of our greatest living actors \u2014 perhaps truly the best of them all. And so the first and most important thing to say about \u201cAnemone,\u201d a bleak, somber, absorbing but also sometimes frustratingly opaque collaboration with his director son Ronan, is that it's brought Day-Lewis back. He told us eight years ago that he was done with acting, and we hoped he was exaggerating. At least for now, it seems he was.",
      "As for the phone book: Well, there\u2019s a moment here where you might wish that was indeed the content you were hearing. In one of two remarkable monologues that punctuate a movie otherwise spare with words, Day-Lewis, playing a bitter and lonely recluse, lets loose an anecdote so shockingly scatological and epically disgusting \u2014 the script is co-written by father and son, by the way \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to erase from one\u2019s mind (still trying, here). Somehow, he makes it more fascinating than revolting \u2014 but it\u2019s a Herculean task, something Day-Lewis the actor is obviously no stranger to.",
      "The film's title refers to a flower that we briefly see growing in the lush woodlands where we find Day-Lewis\u2019 character, Ray, eking out the sparest of existences. The father-son writers take their time explaining why exactly Ray has consigned himself to this solitary life, but we get a key hint in the first frames of the film \u2014 violent kids\u2019 drawings, with stick figures carrying long guns, and severed limbs.",
      "We soon learn that both Ray and brother Jem (Sean Bean) were British soldiers, veterans of the early days of the Northern Ireland troubles. They're also victims of a violent childhood in care homes.",
      "But they haven't seen each other in two decades, their bond torn asunder by some unrevealed trauma that led them to each seek comfort \u2014 or absolution \u2014 in different places. Jem has found it in strict religious practice, and home life with Nessa, Ray's former partner, and Brian, their son.",
      "It is teenager Brian\u2019s deepening troubles that have spurred Jem to seek out his brother in the lush but forbidding woods, where Ray leads an ascetic life devoted to the most basic human survival. Ronan Day-Lewis, a painter making his feature directorial debut, is at his best in creating, along with cinematographer Ben Fordesman, a sense of the unpredictability of nature, culminating in a dramatic hailstorm.",

But the brothers connect, slowly, in mundane activities like brushing their teeth, swimming in the ocean, or dancing wildly together.",
      "The words do come tumbling when Ray relates his tale of how he wrought revenge upon a priest who repeatedly molested him as a child. This bracing monologue \u2014 in which he describes defecating on the man in sickening detail \u2014 is only a precursor to an extraordinary speech later in the film that is vintage Day-Lewis, a searing account of the life-altering moment he killed a young boy. \u201cI don\u2019t need your absolution,\u201d he snarls to his brother, when the latter tries to veer him away from the guilt and shame that have crippled him for 20 years.",
      "But clearly Ray does need some sort of absolution, and his confession to his brother is that first step.",
      "Will Ray find a way to come in from the cold and reconnect with his son? The artistic parallels are a little too neat to ignore \u2014 a son bringing Day-Lewis the actor back into view, for the benefit of us all.",

      "But the big-screen absence of the actor many would peg as the greatest one alive ends with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a new film directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. The two of them wrote it together. What began as something small, with no real ambition, grew until a full feature film and Day-Lewis\u2019 long-awaited return to movies.",
      "\u201cIt saddened me that I had perhaps ruled myself out of that when I decided to work on something else for a while,\u201d Day-Lewis said in an interview alongside his son. \u201cAs we progressed through it, and it seemed less and less possible to contain it, like two fellas in a shed, it began to alarm me slightly. I understood that this was going to involve the full paraphernalia of a film production, and that wasn\u2019t something I was eager to get back into.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we just kept moving forward to see what would happen,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd this is what happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnemone,\u201d which recently premiered at the New York Film Festival and which Focus Features releases Friday in theaters, finds Day-Lewis, now 68, not even slightly less intense or magnetic a performer. It\u2019s a father-son story, though not an autobiographical one. Day-Lewis stars as Ray Stoker, a solitary hermit living in a remote cabin. His brother, Jem (Sean Bean), arrives and tries to convince him to return to his teenage son.",
      "Since 2017\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Day-Lewis has, among other things, studied violin making in Boston. But he has also come to think of his declaration of retirement as a mistake, or not quite what he intended. At least, it wasn\u2019t enough to stand in the way of him making a movie with his son.",

This then requires a period of five or six years recovery!\u201d Day-Lewis says. \u201cThat was never the case. The work itself was always nourishing to me.\u201d",
      "Yet after making \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s London-set portrait of a perfectionist couturier, Day-Lewis was uncertain that he would ever regenerate the appetite to tackle another role.",

And it\u2019s something I never found a solution to from the day I started doing this work until now. The public aspect of my life I\u2019ve always been baffled by.\u201d",
      "The most meaningful gesture Day-Lewis is offering his son might not be making a movie with him, but returning to the spotlight for it. At the New York Film Festival, Day-Lewis has been a happy, humble presence, calling himself a fool for his professed retirement and dutifully accepting a glare of attention that he\u2019s largely avoided for the last decade.",

It never changed. I love that work, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t do it as an act of self-flagellation.\u201d",
      "Day-Lewis\u2019 Method-acting immersion in a character has long been the stuff of legend. Jim Sheridan, who directed him in three films, including \u201cMy Left Foot,\u201d once remarked, \u201cDaniel hates acting.\u201d But the idea that Day-Lewis somehow makes himself into a martyr for his art has long chafed with him.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s weighed heavily over the years, this sort of misconception which has now become so ludicrous about Method acting, which is a very bad name in the business now,\u201d says Day-Lewis. \u201cWe all find a different way of approaching the same problems. And when we\u2019re on the set, it makes no goddamn difference what system you train under, Meisner or Method or Stanislavski or whatever it might be. You\u2019re just there trying to live in those moments, to burn yourself up trying to find that truth as well as you can.\u201d",
      "Day-Lewis has sensed some of the same all-consuming imagination in Ronan, a 27-year-old painter making his directorial debut. He\u2019s one of two sons Day-Lewis has with his wife, filmmaker Rebecca Miller. (He also has an older son, Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis, from his past relationship with Isabelle Adjani.) From a young age, Day-Lewis saw how invested his son was in creating imagery. Ronan, meanwhile, grew up marveling from a distance at his father\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cIt always held a huge amount of mystery to me what he was doing,\u201d says Ronan, who has vivid memories of being on set for films like \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose.\u201d \u201cTo be inside this realm that I had always been watching curiously from the outside was so intriguing. But there were aspects of his process that still remained a mystery to me, which I think helped, actually.\u201d",
      "For Day-Lewis, building the character of Ray was a step-by-step process that included everything in his woodland world, right down to the expired tin cans of sardines that line his shelves. (\u201cThere were never enough sardines for me,\u201d he says, smiling.) \u201cAnemone\u201d unfolds in fits and starts, with several glorious, improvised monologues surrounded with strikingly lush imagery by Ronan. Day-Lewis so relishes pushing the boundaries of such a fictional world that, once in it, he tends to not want to let go.",
      "\u201cYou hope to create a world, an illusion. And when somebody says to you, \u2018That was the last shot. Go home now,\u2019 that was so bewildering to me because I\u2019m still invested in that world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not I have trouble letting go of it. The trouble I have is that I want to still splash around in that illusion.\u201d",
      "Still, it seems Day-Lewis has in \u201cAnemone\u201d avoided the kind of post-film feeling that followed \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d The actor hasn\u2019t yet announced a forthcoming project, but he acknowledges feeling the capacity for more. While he doesn\u2019t say he missed acting during the last eight years, he appears to have come to some self-acceptance of its fundamental, irrevocable place in his life.",
      "\u201cIt has been my primary form of self-expression for my entire life, since I was a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore, I don\u2019t know if I experience it as a sense of missing if I\u2019m not doing it. But the need to express myself in that way, even at a subterranean level, that is still there.\u201d",
      "But just as it\u2019s time to go, Day-Lewis offers \u201can appendix\u201d to his answer. If \u201cAnemone\u201d has left him still hungry for more, that fact is owed partly to the nature of its making. Not just that it was done with Ronan, but that they made it, themselves. It\u2019s Day-Lewis\u2019 first screenwriting credit.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s a completely new experience for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI never really dared attempt to write before, so it\u2019s a new thing. You can begin with absolutely nothing and the hunger can grow out of that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck examines the prophetic messages of George Orwell in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck uses George Orwell\u2019s writings to weave together a biographical portrait of the author and a dispiriting picture of power and truth in the modern world in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s hardly the first to connect the dots between Orwell\u2019s prophetic writings and the current state of things \u2014 remember, sales for \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d soared in the months following Donald Trump\u2019s first election when phrases like \u201calternative facts\u201d were being used with no irony. Knowing that, Peck draws heavily on what has come before. The film is packed with clips from film adaptations of \u201c1984,\u201d including Michael Anderson\u2019s black and white version from 1956, and Michael Radford\u2019s, released in 1984, documentaries, like Robert Kane Pappas\u2019s 2003 warning \u201cOrwell Rolls in His Grave,\u201d and news footage from World War II through Gaza. In sum, it makes a persuasive point that things are only getting worse.",
      "\u201cOrwell: 2+2=5\u201d is loosely structured around Orwell\u2019s time on the Isle of Jura, in Scotland, where he wrote what would be his last novel, \u201c1984,\u201d while his health was deteriorating from tuberculosis. He went to Jura in 1946 and was dead by 1950. But this is no Wikipedia page or college lecture. There are no talking heads and no one explaining, \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a loose assembly of biography, reflection and key moments of political awakening, with actor Damian Lewis narrating Orwell\u2019s words with a poetic gravitas, interspersed with a collage of images, words and archival footage. Anything from David Lean\u2019s \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and Sydney Pollack \u201cOut of Africa\u201d to Lauren Greenfield\u2019s \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is on the table, and nothing is there carelessly. Alexei Aigui\u2019s powerful score adds a melancholy weight to sequences showing wartime destruction past and present along with the political phrases used to describe them: A \u201cstrategic bombing\u201d in Berlin in 1945, \u201cpeacekeeping operations\u201d in Mariupol in 2022, \u201cclearance operation\u201d in Myanmar in 2017.",
      "There\u2019s a purposefully disorienting effect to the film\u2019s editing, blending past, present, fiction and reality in such a way that it all begins to blur together. By the time we\u2019re hearing Lewis utter Orwell\u2019s famous phrase \u201cthe very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world\u201d while AI images pollute the screen, it\u2019s easy to forget that the quote is seven decades old. It won\u2019t prepare you for any kind of historical report on Orwell, totalitarianism or doublespeak, but its impact is undeniable.",
      "Orwell understood that every writer is a product of their own time. Born Eric Arthur Blair in Motihari, Bihar, then an outpost of the British Empire, Peck focuses in on a photograph of him as a baby with his Indian nursemaid. Describing himself as \u201clower upper middle class,\u201d Orwell attended Eton and served with the British Imperial Police in Burma (now Myanmar) and observed how power manifested in colonial outposts, how class unattainable in England was suddenly accessible to any white man simply because they were white. He considered himself both a snob and a revolutionary, which only intensified as he picked up more life experiences through the Spanish Civil War, his time at the BBC and simply observing ordinary people around him. It\u2019s actually quite extraordinary just how much information Peck, who has delved into the lives of James Baldwin, Karl Marx, Patrice Lumumba and Ernest Cole, is able to convey in just under two hours.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country music star Morgan Wallen denied to police that he threw a chair off a Nashville honky-tonk bar roof before and after he was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in 2024, police video obtained by The Associated Press shows.",
      "Roughly two weeks after his April 2024 arrest, Wallen commented on social media: \u201cI'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility\u201d and said he \u201cmade amends\u201d with Nashville law enforcement and others. Then in December, he pleaded guilty to two counts.",
      "The Metro Nashville Police Department released the footage of Wallen\u2019s arrest, captured by several officers' body and cruiser cameras, in response to a public records request from the AP. A previously released arrest affidavit did not get into the details of what Wallen told officers.",
      "A police car camera shows two officers, who were standing outside, react to something apparently falling from above on a late Sunday night. And one officer\u2019s body camera video begins with a shot of a broken chair in the road near his parked police cruiser, close to Chief\u2019s on Broadway, in the city's entertainment district.",
      "Then, as Wallen and his bodyguard team come down to the main entrance on Broadway, one of the men with Wallen is shouting, \u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything. You don\u2019t have witnesses, you are accusing!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw nothing, he didn\u2019t throw nothing,\u201d the bodyguard continues, and accuses two bar workers of \u201cbeing aggressive.\u201d",
      "When an officer asks Wallen what happened, the musician replies, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "He later tells another officer, \u201cWe\u2019ve not tried to cause no problems, man. I don\u2019t know what they are \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\u201d",
      "That officer said police were figuring out what happened after a chair came flying off the roof and landed by his patrol car. Wallen replied, \u201cAs you should.\u201d",
      "At one point, Wallen is on his cellphone, then points it at the officer and says, \u201cEric Church is on the phone.\u201d Church, another country star, co-owns Chief's. During the call, Wallen had used an expletive to describe the officers he said were \u201ctrying to take me to jail outside of your (expletive) bar.\u201d",
      "Church, who can't be heard on the police recording, recommended to the officer that Wallen wait in a private space instead of standing on the public sidewalk, said a representative for Church.",
      "The officer responds: \u201cIt\u2019s not really something we can do. Law enforcement have to enforce the laws. Figure out what happened. We\u2019ve got a supervisor coming to the scene. Gotta treat it like we would with anybody else.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Wallen did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Back in the bar, police were in an office watching security footage from the roof, body camera footage shows. The security video was not clear from the officers' body cameras and a police spokesperson said there was no security camera footage from the bar in the case files.",
      "The officers return outside and a sergeant, who says he watched security video of Wallen throwing a chair off the roof, handcuffs him.",

      "Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Crowds wore maga flowers and \u201cpavas\u201d \u2014 straw hats traditionally worn by j\u00edbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa.",
      "Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (\u201clittle house\u201d), for the pari de marquesina, a house party.",
      "If all the world's a stage \u2014 might as well make it home.",
      "In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish \u2014 a landmark moment for Latino culture.",
      "Bad Bunny's \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir De Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency (in English, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history \u2014 reggaet\u00f3n hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d (\u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos.\")",
      "There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song \u201cLo Que Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout\u201d), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.",
      "Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream \u2014 but it is enough for a taste.",
      "It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the \u201800s. He\u2019s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further \u2014 helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.",
      "Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year.",
      "In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.",
      "\u201cThere was the issue of \u2014 like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it\u2019s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,\u201d he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.",
      "Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,\u201d he said in a video last year.",
      "For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an \u201canti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.",

      "It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d reminding them to \u201cplay the game.\u201d There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.",
      "At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities \u2014 among them LeBron James, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arc\u00e1ngel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted \u201cPreciosa,\u201d which is viewed as one of Puerto Rico\u2019s unofficial anthems.",
      "Written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn in 1937, \u201cPreciosa\u201d references Puerto Rico\u2019s hybrid identity \u2014 a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures \u2014 and threats made to the island in its long colonial history. (\u201cNo importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,\u201d goes the chorus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.\u201d) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.",
      "It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets \u2014 and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same \u2014 but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight \u2014 informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.",

      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

      "Access to officials in the Pentagon has been invaluable in helping reporters understand what is going on, said Dana Priest, a longtime national security reporter at The Washington Post who is now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland. With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",
      "Experienced national security reporters know there are many ways to get information, including through other channels of government and people in the private sector. \u201cThe Pentagon is always very well versed in the advantages of controlling the story, so they always try to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reporters know that. They've known that for decades.\u201d",
      "Reporters who don\u2019t follow the new rules won\u2019t necessarily be expelled immediately, Parnell told the reporter\u2019s committee. But access will be determined by Hegseth\u2019s team.",
      "While reporters already stationed in the Pentagon were given until Sept. 30 to sign, they were allowed to request an additional five days for legal review.",
      "Although the Times, Washington Post and Atlantic all put out statements against the Pentagon's plan, none of the publications would say what they have recommended that their reporters do \u2014 perhaps an indication that they consider negotiations potentially fruitful.",
      "President Donald Trump hasn't hesitated to fight the media when he thinks he's been wronged, launching lawsuits against CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal and the Times. Yet he's also frequently accessible to the press, more so than many of his predecessors, and there has been some uncertainty in the White House about the Pentagon's policy.",
      "When a reporter asked, \u201cshould the Pentagon be in charge of deciding what reporters can report on?\u201d the president replied, \u201cNo, I don't think so. Listen, nothing stops reporters. You know that.\u201d",
      "Goldberg noted that it's more than just an issue for reporters. \u201cThe American people have a right to know what the world's most powerful military does in their name and with their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems fairly obvious to me.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Friday night was anything but typical at a bar near Paulista Avenue, one of Sao Paulo\u2019s busiest areas and a popular destination for tourists. Nearly every table was ordering beer, wine or draft beer but no cocktails.",
      "Edilson Trindade, the manager who has worked at the bar since 2018, told The Associated Press the establishment usually sells about 80 caipirinhas \u2014 Brazil\u2019s national cocktail made with cacha\u00e7a, lime, sugar and ice \u2014 each night. Last week, he didn\u2019t sell a single one. No other cocktails were ordered, either.",
      "\u201cClients have been worried, and we\u2019re advising them it\u2019s better not to drink cocktails,\u201d Trindade said.",
      "His concern reflects a nationwide unease over distilled beverages following a surge in methanol poisoning cases that has prompted police investigations, stoked public fear and altered drinking habits in recent days.",
      "The Health Ministry said Friday it had confirmed 11 cases tied to alcoholic beverages and was investigating 116 suspected cases. One death was confirmed through lab tests in Sao Paulo, with eleven others under investigation.",
      "Nearly all the cases have been reported in Sao Paulo, the country's most populous state and the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "Last week, local media reported deaths and hospitalizations linked to methanol-tainted alcohol. Some patients were admitted to intensive care with severe symptoms, including blindness.",
      "One of them was the rapper Hungria, who has been hospitalized in Brasilia after possibly drinking altered alcohol. On Friday, he posted on his Instagram account that he was feeling better and would soon be discharged.",
      "\"Friday has a different energy. If you feel thirsty, find a safe place to have a drink,\" the singer said.",
      "Health Minister Alexandre Padilha urged Brazilians to avoid drinking, especially distilled beverages, which are more difficult to verify for adulteration. He described the situation as abnormal and noted that Brazil recorded 20 methanol poisoning cases in August and September, equal to its annual average.",
      "\u201cAs a physician and health minister, I advise everyone to avoid distilled products, especially colorless ones, unless you\u2019re certain of their origin,\" Padilha said. \"These are not essential items.\u201d",

      "\u201cWith all these cases that keep coming up and more deaths being reported each day, it\u2019s alarming.

I\u2019m sticking to beer.\u201d",
      "There are three main types of alcohol: ethanol, methanol, and isopropanol. Ethanol is safe for consumption and is found in spirits. Isopropanol is used in sanitizers and rubbing alcohol. Methanol, also known as wood alcohol, is used in fuel, antifreeze, and solvents.",
      "Methanol poisoning can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, seizures, and even coma, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC advises immediate medical attention if poisoning is suspected.",

      "The Brazilian Association of Distilled Beverages said the illicit alcohol market is on the rise. A study by Euromonitor, commissioned by the association, found that adulterated beverages make up 28% of Brazil\u2019s market and are sold at prices 35% lower than legitimate products.",

      "Though it\u2019s conventional wisdom, many relationship experts say sticking to such a rule is counterproductive. It may even harm the relationship.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely wrong,\u201d said Samantha Whiten, a clinical psychologist in Maryland. \u201cAll it does is make sure that people are fighting when they\u2019re tired.\u201d",
      "Instead, couples can learn habits that help them get rest while boosting the relationship long term.",
      "It\u2019s understandable to want to discuss a problem before letting it fester, Whiten said, but it\u2019s unrealistic to expect conflicts to be wrapped up quickly and lovingly before drifting off to sleep.",
      "\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fairy tale, though.\u201d",
      "Some sources attribute the origin of the phrase to the New Testament book of Ephesians. Translations vary, but it\u2019s some version of: \u201cBe angry but do not sin; do not let the sun set on your anger.\u201d",
      "The trouble is, couples shouldn\u2019t fight when they are \u201cemotionally dysregulated,\u201d Whiten said. She referred to the acronym HALT, a common reminder in therapy that people should avoid serious discussions when hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Many people also drink alcohol at night, which doesn\u2019t help create a calm environment.",
      "\u201cThey are more likely to say and do things impulsively that they may regret,\u201d she said.",
      "Discussing problems at night might seem easiest because it's when your partner is most available, said Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist in New York City.",
      "But it\u2019s better to acknowledge that something needs to be discussed, take a pause, and set a time to come back to it, she said. That could mean having lunch or coffee together the next day, or any time you\u2019re not rushing out the door.",
      "The key is to follow through.",
      "\u201cIt speaks to a skill, to trust that your partner is really going to return to this thing that\u2019s really important to you,\u201d Romanoff said, adding that most couples have to practice that.",

      "Whiten said many couples in her practice have at least one person who feels they won\u2019t be able to sleep until they resolve a fight. That\u2019s often a sign of anxiety and a discomfort with uncertainty.",

      "The goal is that both people feel secure enough to acknowledge the disagreement, remember their relationship is more important than one argument, and agree to talk about it later, Whiten said. \u201cWhen people can learn to do that, it\u2019s really transformative.\u201d",
      "Romanoff suggested that couples establish regular check-ins. They don\u2019t have to talk about the worst problems in their lives at a given point, but they should make a habit of small gestures of communication.",

      "When there is an issue, use \u201cI\u201d statements, be clear about what you need, and try to create a plan for how the other person can deliver, she said. A request posed at an appropriate time will often be better received.",

      "MIAMI -- MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jonas Richards became homeless several years ago after losing his job as a truck driver. Despite suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, seeing a doctor hasn't been a major priority since then.",
      "\u201cWhen you're homeless, it's not easy,\u201d Richards said. \u201cYou find yourself hustling, trying to keep a little money in your pocket, trying to find something to eat.\u201d",
      "But Richards recently had his first visit with doctors from Miami Street Medicine while sitting on a curb outside a homeless shelter.",
      "\u201cYou get everything done right here very fast,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt was a big help.\u201d",
      "Miami Street Medicine is a nonprofit organization providing free mobile health care services to homeless people. It\u2019s part of a larger group, Dade County Street Response, which also includes a free clinic called Doctors Within Borders, a disaster relief team and a mental health crisis line.",
      "Miami Street Medicine teams of paid staff and medical school student volunteers aren\u2019t just bandaging cuts and handing out aspirin. They\u2019re performing intake on patients with tablet computers and offer follow-up visits for chronic conditions. They're working with specialists like dermatologists, neurologists and cardiologists.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out there to meet the needs of our patients,\u201d founder Dr. Dan Bergholz said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s a cough drop, we\u2019ve got you. We are happy to help you with that cough drop. But really the mission is so much greater. It\u2019s showing that we care, and we\u2019re there for them. So when that cough becomes pneumonia, they\u2019ll let us listen to their lungs and maybe trust us to take them to the hospital.\u201d",
      "Bergholz began laying groundwork for Miami Street Medicine about seven years ago. He said he had started doing charity outreach with homeless people as an undergraduate, but it seemed like more could be done.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like we weren\u2019t quite moving the needle for folks,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "After learning more about the growing trend of street medicine and being accepted to the University of Miami\u2019s medical school, Bergholz began working with other students to set up a program.",
      "\u201cI moved down to Miami early and just started hitting the streets and chatting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could call it a needs assessment.\u201d",
      "Just as Miami Street Medicine was taking off, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced the group to adjust. Bergholz connected with Dade County Street Response to provide health care to more underserved areas.",

      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that ends homelessness is easy access to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that encourages people to be unsheltered. No one wants to be unsheltered. So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re able to fill that void and hopefully prevent a couple more admissions,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBut we're also able to do a human service for him, for our fellow man, to provide him with the necessary health care so he can begin his path toward a productive life.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks.",

      "The criticism comes as Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug\u2019s safety.",

      "The idea of meditating can be intimidating to beginners",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea of meditating can be intimidating. Beginners may imagine sitting uncomfortably in silence while breathing deeply and scrubbing all thoughts from their minds. The prospect of trying those techniques at work may feel embarrassing.",
      "But there are ways to bring short, inconspicuous sessions into the workday if you want to see if meditation can help you deal with challenging customers or reduce anxiety while preparing for a presentation. And experienced practitioners say there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
      "\u201c Meditation is quite easy, as a matter of fact. I think there\u2019s a stigma around it, that you have to be in complete silence, and you have to have some room setup, or do some chanting, or some serious breathing,\u201d said Michelle Beyer, a wellness coach who owns the Brooklyn women\u2019s gym Alana Life & Fitness. \u201cThere\u2019s one-minute meditations you can do to make yourself feel great. Nobody will even know you\u2019re doing them.\"",
      "While there are different meditation techniques, many traditions encourage focusing on breathing to help calm the mind. When thoughts pop up, imagine letting them go. Practitioners say meditating before or at work helps them maintain focus, sit still and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cThere is a calm that I am definitely missing when I have forgotten to do it for a few days,\u201d said Brianna Healy, who meditates for 10 minutes daily before starting her job as assistant director of strategic initiatives and data solutions at Naropa University, a college in Boulder, Colorado, that is inspired by Buddhist principles. \u201cI can always tell the difference in my demeanor.\"",
      "If you feel pressed for time, try fitting meditation sessions into breaks. You can set a timer and focus on breathing while sitting at a desk, in a restroom, inside a vehicle or outside, Beyer said.",
      "Here are some easy mini-meditations to try out on the job.",
      "Commuters can consider getting to work a little early and taking a pause in their cars or a quiet location to decompress from getting out the door and to your destination, said Kathryn Remati, a meditation teacher and author of \u201cBefriend Yourself.\u201d If you only have a minute or two, that's still enough time to try Remati's instructions for a quick reset.",
      "Close your eyes and take a long, slow, deep breath to fill your tummy and lungs with air, she said. Hold the breath for a second, and then slowly breathe out like you're blowing out a candle. \"You\u2019ll immediately feel a shift and you\u2019ll feel like a human again,\u201d Remati said.",
      "While repeating that process, consider setting a positive intention, or goal, for the day. Instead of focusing on a to-do list, think about how you want behave towards others, she said. Some intention examples are, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be productive, but I\u2019m also going to a good listener\u201d or \u201cI want to have a positive attitude,\u201d she said.",
      "Visualization is another technique that experienced meditators use. Picture yourself succeeding at the challenges you\u2019ll encounter that day. If there\u2019s an upcoming deadline, envision yourself finishing the task 10 minutes early. Jumping for joy. Get specific like a movie director and imagine the colors in the room or the feeling of wind on your face, Remati said.",
      "Throughout the day, \u201cyou can bring up that image anytime you need it to refocus,\u201d she said.",
      "You can also use visualization to reframe your perspective on colleagues or clients. A technique Remati recommends putting into practice before meetings may seem quirky: Envision a white light over the meeting room's doorway that showers the people entering with brightness. Remati says it may help you imagine them in a better light. \u201cYou can even put some sort of pink bubble around people,\" she added.",
      "Another short meditation that can be done almost anywhere involves breathing deeply and mentally scanning your body for sensations, a technique popularized in the U.S. by mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn. Depending on your location and comfort level, you can keep your eyes open or closed.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re intentionally scanning your body,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about, how do your feet feel in your shoes? How do your ankles feel? Knees, hips, ribs, shoulders, neck, head, and by the time you know it, you checked in with every part of your body.\"",
      "Another discreet meditation technique is breathing deeply and joining your pointer finger to your thumb to form a circle. You can do this if you feel your stress level rising. \u201cSay to yourself, whenever I put my finger and thumb together, I will be able to be peaceful and open-minded,\u201d Remati said.",
      "If you're in a meeting and start to feel resentful or left out, you can do it under the table, and no one will know, she added. Remati does this herself if she notices she's becoming judgmental or short-tempered. \u201cYou just do the finger and thumb, take a nice deep breath, get grounded, and then get back into the meeting and feeling positive,\u201d she said.",
      "One of Beyer's favorite techniques is best done when there aren't a lot of people nearby. Truck drivers can do it in traffic. You inhale, and then when you're breathing out, you hum with your lips closed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's going to immediately take down stress levels in the body and even in the mind,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cWhen you inhale and you focus on humming, then your brain is focused on that, not the \u2018what ifs' or the worries that like to take over when we feel stressed.\u201d",
      "If you feel self-conscious about humming in a quiet office, you can step outside or head to a noisier place.",
      "The shoulder and jaw release technique also may help relax the bodies of train passengers or drivers or stuck in traffic, Beyer said. To start, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Repeat that, and then on the third exhale, roll your shoulders back. Inhale a fourth time and then on the next exhale relax your tongue and jaw, Beyer said. Finally, inhale again, bring your attention to your hands and just let them hang heavy, she said. Then breathe in and out a sixth time.",
      "Another technique Remati encourages is saying mantras or affirmations, which are positive statements or slogans you repeat to yourself. You can write them down and say them in your head or out loud while breathing deeply, before a meeting or at any point throughout the day.",
      "Some phrases you might say: \u201cI am calm.\" Deep breath. \u201cI am confident.\u201d Deep breath. \"I am ready for success,\u201d Remati suggested. \u201cI speak my truth. I am patient. I am here for the highest good of all.\u201d",

      "But that won\u2019t be easy. Republican leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump \u2014 have said that they won\u2019t negotiate or be \u201cheld hostage \u201d by Democrats demanding concessions to reopen the government. The bill Democrats voted against was a simple extension of funding for 45 days, legislation they say should be noncontroversial.",
      "While that uncompromising Republican position may not last long \u2014 there were some early, informal talks on the Senate floor Wednesday \u2014 reaching a deal would be difficult. It\u2019s deeply uncertain, for now, if the two sides could find common ground on health care policy or sow enough trust for the Democrats to change their position.",
      "At the same time, an extended shutdown could be increasingly painful for Democrats. The Trump administration has threatened to lay off thousands of workers and target Democratic-leaning states. On Wednesday, the White House announced it was putting a hold on subway and tunnel projects in Schumer\u2019s home state of New York.",
      "\u201cThis Democrat shutdown is actually delaying progress on the issues that Democrats claim to be interested in,\u201d Thune, who represents South Dakota, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.",
      "Republicans were encouraged Tuesday evening when three Democrats voted with them to keep the government open \u2014 Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.",
      "Republicans, who hold the majority, need eight Democrats to win the 60 votes needed for passage in the 53-47 Senate. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote with Democrats against the measure.",
      "Thune is holding repeated votes on the measure, which failed 55-45 on Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning. He said he hopes that five Democrats will eventually feel the pressure and support the bill \u201cwhen they realize that this is playing a losing hand.\u201d",
      "Republicans are eyeing several moderate Democrats who appeared to be wavering before casting \u201cno\u201d votes on Tuesday night, including Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Gary Peters of Michigan. Both voted to keep the government open in March, along with Schumer, while many of their colleagues voted for a shutdown.",
      "But Shaheen and Peters each voted no on Tuesday after extensive negotiations with colleagues in both parties on the floor. Shaheen said afterward that \u201cI have been in intensive conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on how to find a path forward and I\u2019m eager to work with my Republican colleagues to find common ground.\u201d",
      "As some Democrats are already looking for a way out, others say they need to dig in and fight.",
      "\u201cAs Donald Trump\u2019s lawlessness grows during this shutdown, our spines should stiffen, not bend,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a social media post on Wednesday. \u201cLet\u2019s stand for something. The American people don\u2019t want us to fund the destruction of their health care and the destruction of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The divisions in the caucus pose a dilemma for Schumer, who was blasted by base voters and activists in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. Many Democrats in the House and Senate have suggested that shutting down the government is their only leverage to fight Trump and push back on his policies, including health care and spending cuts.",
      "\u201cStanding up to (Trump) on this is sending a message to him on those other issues as well,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.",
      "Democrats have demanded that Republicans immediately extend health care subsidies for people who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The expanded subsidies first put in place in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic are set to expire at the end of the year, raising premium costs for millions of people.",

      "At issue are tax credits that have made health insurance more affordable for millions of people since the COVID-19 pandemic. The subsidies, which go to low- and middle-income people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, are slated to expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn't extend them. Their expiration would more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues.",
      "Democrats have demanded that the subsidies, first put in place in 2021 and extended a year later, be extended again. They also want any government funding bill to reverse the Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump'smega-bill passed this summer, which don't go into effect immediately but are already driving some states to cut Medicaid payments to health providers.",
      "Some Republicans have expressed an openness to extending the tax credits, acknowledging many of their constituents will see steep hikes in insurance premiums. But the party's lawmakers in Congress argue negotiations over health care will take time, and a stopgap measure to get the government funded is a more urgent priority.",
      "A record 24 million people have signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",

      "When the tax credits expire at the end of 2025, enrollees across the income spectrum will see costs spike. Annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% \u2014 an average of $1,016 \u2014 next year, according to the KFF analysis.",

      "Supporters have said the closures will have a detrimental impact on Louisiana, where Planned Parenthood has never been licensed to perform abortions in the state but did provide other medical care services to nearly 11,000 patients last year at its Baton Rouge and New Orleans clinics.",
      "Advocates and medical professionals fear that the organization\u2019s departure will further exacerbate reproductive health care in a state that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows already has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country.

      "The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases in the last five years that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s federal food benefits",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.",
      "In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by.",
      "\u201cThe people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cIt\u2019s our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d",

But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",
      "National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn\u2019t unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases \u2014 not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said.",
      "He\u2019s studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals.",
      "In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she\u2019d checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times.",
      "She lost her SNAP benefits for a year. In an appeal, the woman told the state she has two kids and had recently discovered she was pregnant.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgets to get something and has to go back in the store and get it,\u201d she wrote, defending her back-to-back purchases.",
      "She received another hearing, but the outcome didn\u2019t change.",
      "Cabinet officials acknowledged in cross examinations during a 2023 case that back-to-back transactions and whole-dollar purchases aren\u2019t forbidden under SNAP rules, nor are recipients told that the cabinet considers them suspicious.",
      "But all of these things are used as evidence \u2014 sometimes the sole evidence \u2014 that a person misused their benefits.",
      "Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they\u2019ve declined in the last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ...

      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",

      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",

      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",

      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",

      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",

      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",

She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",

      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",

      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",

      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",

      "Vivienne Westwood's legacy shines at Paris Fashion Week with a theatrical show at the Institut de France",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Light streamed through the stained glass of the Institut de France onto a surreal stage: a lone cellist playing a melancholy air, next to an upside-down umbrella and a rotating tableau of dying sunflowers. It was a theatrical overture for Saturday's Paris Fashion Week. This was spring \u2014 Vivienne Westwood style.",
      "Andreas Kronthaler, who has helmed the house since Westwood\u2019s death in 2022 and whose name joined the label in 2016, leaned hard into the madhat energy that made the brand a legend. Leopard-print men\u2019s underwear sat alongside sheer, ribbed tunics with a medieval air. Punk flashed in a jeweled veil and glittered lapels. Models strode in floppy, swashbuckling \u201970s boots that turned the grand academic setting into a carnival.",
      "The lineup spoke fluent Westwood: draped and deconstructed silhouettes, gathered dresses with double skirts, tailoring cut just off balance. Colors clashed on purpose, with sour greens near reds \u2014 until the eye adjusted and chaos clicked into order. One jeweled necklace made it literal: \u201cCHAOS.\u201d",
      "Westwood made her name on King\u2019s Road in the 1970s, wiring tartan, corsetry and ripped tees into the grammar of punk. That outsider spirit still drives the house, even as its reach has gone mainstream. Since Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s iconic Westwood bridal gown in \u201c Sex and the City,\u201d the label\u2019s wedding business has boomed \u2014 a point underscored by the hundreds of noisy fans thronging the Institut de France on Saturday, jostling for a glimpse.",
      "Kronthaler has long thrived on turning bourgeois classics inside out \u2014 warping jackets, loading corsetry into knits, twisting tartan into punk romance. That maximalist urge can tip into excess, yet it is also the house\u2019s lifeblood, keeping Westwood\u2019s language loud and elastic rather than embalmed.",
      "Much of Westwood\u2019s power has historically come from mining and mutating the archive \u2014 the \u201980s corset legacy, Napoleonic swagger, Shakespearean drama. Since Westwood\u2019s passing, Kronthaler has shifted from careful custodian to provocateur, forging new hybrids instead of simply quoting the past. Saturday\u2019s show advanced that shift: historic tunics, technical fabrics and second-skin underwear collided by design, not accident.",

At the time, he acknowledged development had not adequately trickled down to benefit all and promised progress was underway.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill allowing 800,000 Uber and Lyft drivers in the state to join a union and bargain collectively for better wages and benefits",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 More than 800,000 drivers for ride-hailing companies in California will soon be able to join a union and bargain collectively for better wages and benefits under a measure signed Friday by Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Supporters said the new law will open a path for the largest expansion of private sector collective bargaining rights in the state's history. The legislation is a significant compromise in the yearslong battle between labor unions and tech companies.",
      "California is the second state where Uber and Lyft drivers can unionize as independent contractors. Massachusetts voters passed a ballot referendum in November allowing unionization, while drivers in Illinois and Minnesota are pushing for similar rights.",
      "Newsom announced the signing at an unrelated news conference at University of California, Berkeley. The new law will give drivers \u201cdignity and a say about their future,\u201d he said.",
      "The new law is part of an agreement made in September between Newsom, state lawmakers and the Service Employees International Union, along with rideshare companies Uber and Lyft. In exchange, Newsom also signed a measure supported by Uber and Lyft to significantly cut the companies' insurance requirements for accidents caused by underinsured drivers.",
      "Lyft CEO David Risher said in September that the new insurance rates are expected to save the company $200 million and could help reduce fares.",
      "Uber and Lyft fares in California are consistently higher than in other parts of the U.S. because of insurance requirements, the companies say. Uber has said that nearly one-third of every ride fare in the state goes toward paying for state-mandated insurance.",
      "Labor unions and tech companies have fought for years over drivers' rights. In July of last year, the California Supreme Court ruled that app-based ride-hailing and delivery services like Uber and Lyft can continue treating their drivers as independent contractors not entitled to benefits like overtime pay, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance. A 2019 law mandated that Uber and Lyft provide drivers with benefits, but voters reversed it at the ballot in 2020.",
      "The collective bargaining measure now allows rideshare workers in California to join a union while still being classified as independent contractors and requires gig companies to bargain in good faith. The new law doesn\u2019t apply to drivers for delivery apps like DoorDash.",
      "The insurance measure will reduce the coverage requirement for accidents caused by uninsured or underinsured drivers from $1 million to $60,000 per individual and $300,000 per accident.",
      "The two measures \"together represent a compromise that lowers costs for riders while creating stronger voices for drivers \u2014demonstrating how industry, labor, and lawmakers can work together to deliver real solutions,\u201d Ramona Prieto, head of public policy for California at Uber, said in a statement.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 From Wall Street trading floors to the Federal Reserve to economists sipping coffee in their home offices, the first Friday morning of the month typically brings a quiet hush around 8:30 a.m. eastern as everyone awaits the Labor Department's crucial monthly jobs report.",
      "But with the government shut down, no information was released Friday about hiring in September.",
      "It's the first time since a government shutdown in 2013 that the jobs report has been delayed. During the 2018-2019 partial government closure, the Labor Department was one of several agencies that remained open because Congress had agreed to fund them. September's jobs figures will be released eventually, once the shutdown ends.",
      "The interruption in the data has occurred at a particularly uncertain time, when policymakers at the Federal Reserve and Wall Street investors would need more data on the economy, rather than less. Hiring has ground nearly to a halt, threatening to drag down the broader economy. Yet at the same time, consumers \u2014 particularly higher-income earners \u2014 are still spending and some businesses are ramping up investments in data centers developing artificial intelligence models. Whether that is enough to revive hiring remains to be seen.",
      "For now, economists are turning to alternative measures of the job market provided by nonprofits and private-sector companies. Those measures mostly show a job market with little hiring, but not many layoffs, either. Those who have jobs appear to be mostly secure, while those looking for work are having a tougher time.",

      "VALHALLA, New York -- Pepsi has a new challenge: keeping products like Gatorade and Cheetos vivid and colorful without the artificial dyes that U.S. consumers are increasingly rejecting.",
      "PepsiCo, which also makes Doritos, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Funyuns and Mountain Dew, announced in April that it would accelerate a planned shift to using natural colors in its foods and beverages. Around 40% of its U.S. products now contain synthetic dyes, according to the company.",
      "But just as it took decades for artificial colors to seep into PepsiCo\u2019s products, removing them is likely to be a multi-year process. The company said it\u2019s still finding new ingredients, testing consumers\u2019 responses and waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve natural alternatives. PepsiCo hasn\u2019t committed to meeting the Trump administration\u2019s goal of phasing out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to launch a product that the consumer\u2019s not going to enjoy,\u201d said Chris Coleman, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director for food research and development in North America. \u201cWe need to make sure the product is right.\u201d",
      "Coleman said it can take two or three years to shift a product from an artificial color to a natural one. PepsiCo has to identify a natural ingredient that will have a stable shelf life and not change a product\u2019s flavor. Then it must ensure the availability of a safe and adequate supply. The company tests prototypes with trained experts and panels of consumers, then makes sure the new formula won\u2019t snag its manufacturing process. It also has to design new packaging.",
      "Tostitos and Lay\u2019s will be the first PepsiCo brands to make the shift, with naturally dyed tortilla and potato chips expected on store shelves later this year and naturally dyed dips due to be on sale early next year. Most of the chips, dips and salsas in the two lines already are naturally colored, but there were some exceptions.",
      "The reddish-brown tint of Tostitos Salsa Verde, for example, came from four synthetic colors: Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40 and Blue 1. Coleman said the company is switching to carob powder, which gives the chips a similar color, but needed to tweak the recipe to ensure the addition of the cocoa alternative wouldn\u2019t affect the taste.",
      "In its Frito-Lay food labs and test kitchens in Plano, Texas, PepsiCo is experimenting with ingredients like paprika and turmeric to mimic the bright reds and oranges in products like Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, Coleman said.",
      "The company is looking at purple sweet potatoes and various types of carrots to color drinks like Mountain Dew and Cherry 7Up, according to Damien Browne, the vice president of research and development for PepsiCo\u2019s beverage division based in Valhalla, New York.",
      "Getting the hue right is critical, since many consumers know products like Gatorade by their color and not necessarily their name, Browne said.",
      "\u201cWe eat with our eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at a plate of food, it\u2019s generally the different kinds of colors that will tell you what you would like or not.\u201d",
      "When the Pepsi-Cola Company was founded in 1902, the absence of artificial dyes was a point of pride. The company marketed Pepsi as \u201cThe Original Pure Food Drink\u201d to differentiate the cola from rivals that used lead, arsenic and other toxins as food colorants before the U.S. banned them in 1906.",
      "But synthetic dyes eventually won over food companies. They were vibrant, consistent and cheaper than natural colors. They are also rigorously tested by the FDA.",
      "Still, PepsiCo said it started seeing a small segment of shoppers asking for products without artificial colors or flavors more than two decades ago. In 2002, it launched its Simply line of chips, which offer natural versions of products like Doritos. A dye-free organic Gatorade came out in 2016.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for those little signals that will become humongous in the future,\u201d Amanda Grzeda, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director of global sensory and consumer experience, said of the company's close attention to consumer preferences.",
      "Grzeda said the whisper PepsiCo detected in the early 2000s has become a roar, fueled by social media and growing consumer interest in ingredients. More than half of the consumers PepsiCo spoke to for a recent internal study said they were trying to reduce their consumption of artificial dyes, Grzeda said.",

      "Hopes for a quick end to the government shutdown are fading",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hopes for a quick end to the government shutdown were fading Friday as Republicans and Democrats dug in for a prolonged fight and President Donald Trump readied plans to unleash layoffs and cuts across the federal government.",
      "Senators were headed back to the Capitol for another vote on government funding on the third day of the shutdown, but there has been no sign of any real progress toward ending their standoff. Democrats are demanding that Congress extend health care benefits, while Republicans are trying to wear them down with day after day of voting on a House-passed bill that would reopen the government temporarily, mostly at current spending levels.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times you\u2019re going to give them a chance to vote no,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune said at a news conference Friday. He added that he would give Democratic senators the weekend to think it over.",
      "Although Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Senate's filibuster rules make it necessary for the government funding legislation to gain support from at least 60 of the 100 senators. That's given Democrats a rare opportunity to use their 47 Senate seats to hold out in exchange for policy concessions. The party has chosen to rally on the issue of health care, believing it could be key to their path back to power in Washington.",
      "Their primary demand is that Congress extend tax credits that were boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic for health care plans offered under the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Standing on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \u201cUnderstand this, over the last few days and over the next few days, what you\u2019re going to see is more than 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, co-pays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.\u201d",
      "Democrats are running the high-risk strategy of effectively voting for a government shutdown to make their stand. Trump has vowed to make it as painful as possible for them.",
      "The Republican president has called the government funding lapse an \u201cunprecedented opportunity\u201d to make vast cuts to federal agencies and potentially lay off federal workers, rather than the typical practice of furloughing them. White House budget director Russ Vought has already announced that he is withholding billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in states with Democratic senators.",
      "On Friday morning, Vought said he would withhold another $2.1 billion for Chicago infrastructure projects to extend its train system to the city's South Side.",
      "Jeffries has displayed no signs of budging under those threats.",
      "\u201cThe cruelty that they might unleash on everyday Americans using the pretense of a shutdown is only going to backfire against them,\u201d he said during an interview with The Associated Press and other outlets at the Capitol.",
      "Still, the shutdown, no matter how long it lasts, could have far-reaching effects on the economy. Roughly 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and they could lose out on $400 million in daily wages. That loss in wages until after the government reopens could drive down wider demand for goods and services.",

      "The American public usually spreads the blame around to both major political parties when it comes to a government shutdown. While Trump took a significant portion of the blame during the last partial government shutdown in 2018 as he demanded funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, this standoff could end differently because now it is Democrats making the policy demands.",
      "Still, lawmakers were relentlessly trying to make their case to the American public with a constant beat of news conferences, social media videos and livestreams. Congressional leaders have been especially active.",
      "Both sides expressed confidence that the other would ultimately be found at fault. And in the House, party leaders seemed to be moving farther apart rather than closer to making a deal to end the shutdown.",
      "Jeffries on Thursday called for a permanent extension to the ACA tax credits. Meanwhile, Johnson and Thune told reporters that they would not negotiate on the tax credits until the government is reopened.",
      "A few senators have engaged in bipartisan talks about launching negotiations on extending the ACA tax credits for one year while the Senate votes to reopen the government for several weeks. But those discussions are in their early stages and appear to have little involvement from leadership.",
      "As senators prepared for their last scheduled vote for the week on Friday, they appeared resigned to allow the shutdown to continue at least into next week. Thune said that if the vote failed, he would \u201cgive them the weekend to think about it\u201d before holding more votes.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in a floor speech, called for Republicans to work with her and fellow Democrats to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d on the ACA subsidies, saying their expiration would impact plenty of people in states with GOP senators \u2014 especially in rural areas where farmers, ranchers and small business owners purchase their own health insurance.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, right now our Republican colleagues are not working with us to find a bipartisan agreement to prevent the government shutdown and address the health care crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that even when they float ideas \u2014 which we surely do appreciate \u2014 in the end the president appears to make the call.\u201d",

      "The criticism comes as Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage ticked up for the second straight week following a string of declines that had brought down home borrowing costs to the lowest level in nearly a year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage ticked up for the second straight week following a string of declines that had brought down home borrowing costs to their lowest level in nearly a year.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate rose this week to 6.34% from 6.3% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.12%.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.10% at midday Thursday, down from 4.19% the same time last week. Much of that decline has come in the past few days, driven by discouraging reports on the U.S. economy, particularly the job market.",
      "In late July, mortgage rates started declining in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve\u2019s widely anticipated decision last month to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.",
      "However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has since signaled a cautious approach to future interest rate cuts. That\u2019s in sharp contrast with other members of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee, particularly those who were appointed by President Donald Trump, who are pushing for faster cuts.",
      "The housing market has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. So far this year, sales are running below where they were at this time in 2024.",

Back then, mortgage rates fell for several weeks prior to the Fed\u2019s September rate cut. In the following weeks however, mortgage rates began rising again, eventually reaching just above 7% in mid-January this year.",
      "Like last year, the Fed\u2019s rate cut doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.",
      "Still, the late-summer decline in mortgage rates has already encouraged many homeowners who bought in recent years after rates climbed well above 6% to refinance to a lower rate.",
      "Mortgage rates will have to sink below 6% to make refinancing an attractive option to a broader swath of homeowners, however. That\u2019s because about 81% of U.S. homes have a mortgage with a rate of 6% or lower, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Economists generally forecast the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain near the mid-6% range this year.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also inched up this week. The average rate rose to 5.55% from 5.49% the previous week. A year ago, it was 5.25%, Freddie Mac said.",

      "PARIS -- The captain of an oil tanker immobilized off the country\u2019s Atlantic coast which President Emmanuel Macron linked to Russia will go on trial in February over the crew's alleged refusal to cooperate, a French prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "Macron has alleged that the tanker belongs to Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are avoiding Western sanctions over Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and didn't rule out that it could have been involved in drone flights over Denmark as it was sailing last week off the coast of the Nordic country.",
      "Asked about whether the tanker could be linked to drones flights, Macron said that \u201cI\u2019m very cautious because our services and our justice are still working ... I don\u2019t exclude it at all, but I cannot here attribute very clearly and establish a clear link between these two phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Speaking at a European summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, Macron said that the French navy faced \u201cinappropriate and extremely aggressive behavior\u201d towards the French frigate and helicopters that had been deployed to board the taker, which justified the opening of a judicial investigation.",
      "St\u00e9phane Kellenberger, prosecutor of the western port city of Brest, said that two Chinese crew members, the captain and the chief mate, who had been detained since Tuesday, were released from police custody. The chief mate has been released without charge.",
      "A preliminary investigation was opened into the crew\u2019s \u201crefusal to cooperate\u201d and \u201cfailure to justify the nationality of the vessel\u201d after the Atlantic Maritime Prefect alerted justice authorities Monday, Kellenberger said. The inquiry showed the captain couldn't be directly considered responsible for the second offense, he added.",
      "Kellenberger said that members of the French navy intervened and boarded the ship on Saturday off France's Atlantic coast in line with international law when there appeared to be a discrepancy between its apparent nationality and real nationality.",
      "An investigation led by the French navy concluded that the ship, coming from Russia and heading to India with a \u201clarge oil shipment,\u201d was flying no flag, he said.",

At the time, Prime Minister Kristen Michal posted on social media that Estonia\u2019s navy had \u201cdetained a sanctioned vessel with no flag state\u201d and authorities had boarded the ship -- without specifying.",
      "The ship, now known as \u201cPushpa\u201d or \u201cBoracay,\u201d left the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk near St. Petersburg on Sept. 20, and sailed off the coast of Denmark. It has stayed off the coast of the French western port of Saint-Nazaire since Sunday, according to the Marine Traffic monitoring website.",
      "The tanker, whose name has changed several times, was sailing under the flag of Benin and appears on a list of ships targeted by European Union sanctions against Russia.",

      "Altayli, whose YouTube program attracts hundreds of thousands of views daily, was arrested in June on charges of threatening President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an accusation he strongly denies.

      "The Miami Hurricanes have beaten Florida State, marking their second rivalry win this season",
      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 When the Miami-Florida State game was over, defensive lineman Rueben Bain Jr. sat on the Hurricanes' bench with a blank stare on his face. Quarterback Carson Beck talked about how the team needs to get better. And coach Mario Cristobal was even more succinct.",
      "\u201cWe've got a long way to go,\u201d Cristobal said.",
      "All of that, it should be noted, came after a Miami win \u2014 in a rivalry game, no less.",
      "For the second time this season, the second-ranked Hurricanes (5-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) are heading into a bye week after beating a rival \u2014 first Florida, now Florida State \u2014 and insisting that they have much to improve upon. It's a far cry from what happened when Miami tasted some success in recent seasons, with the inevitable \u201cIs \u2018The U\u2019 back?\u201d question being asked and more often than not the Hurricanes stumbling in the weeks that followed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to go back and watch this game and there\u2019s just so many little things, little mistakes, little plays that are just left out there for grabs when we give them something or we give up something ourselves,\" Beck said. \u201cAnd I just think if we can eliminate those mistakes and stop shooting ourselves in the foot sometimes that we could be really dangerous and really, really good.\u201d",
      "Back at No. 2 this week in the AP Top 25, Miami has matched its highest ranking since being No. 1 for most of the 2002 season. The Hurricanes went 4-0 against in-state teams (beating South Florida, Bethune-Cookman, Florida and Florida State) and are the only team to beat three AP-ranked teams so far this season.",
      "And Beck still sees room to grow. That might be the difference between this Miami team and others that had potential over the last two decades.",
      "\u201cWalking into the locker room and the team not being happy after we win like that, that\u2019s what\u2019s different,\u201d defensive back Jakobe Thomas said. \u201cThese guys are dedicated. I can\u2019t preach enough how much we work each and every day. We're in the building early in the morning, late at night, watching tape together as a team. When I walked in and nobody was really excited after the win, I knew that we've got bigger goals.\u201d",

      "Cristobal looked into the lens of the national television cameras and pointed out that Miami had won the \u201cstate title.\u201d Offensive lineman Francis Mauigoa grabbed a pole with a huge \u201cU\u201d flag on it and tried jamming the end into the turf near midfield at Doak Campbell Stadium. Michael Irvin, after spending the game in his customary spot on the Miami sideline, was cheering with fans long after the final whistle.",
      "Cristobal played for two of Miami's five national championship teams. He knows what the fans want: a sixth title. It's why he came back home when the Hurricanes asked him to leave Oregon four years ago. But even after winning in Tallahassee, he was quick to point out that if Miami wants to be mentioned with the 1983, 1987, 1989, 1991 and 2001 teams, there's still a lot \u2014 a whole lot \u2014 of work left to tackle.",
      "\u201cWe are moving forward. We\u2019re not going back. We\u2019re not,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the principles and values of all those awesome teams, the physicality of those teams, the playmaking ability, the togetherness, the brotherhood of those teams, and going forward and pushing Miami football to modern day football.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Fan favorite Alex Pereira dethroned Magomed Ankalaev at UFC 320, taking the light heavyweight championship with a first-round stoppage Saturday night.",
      "Pereira (13-3-0) floored Ankalaev (21-2-1) after hurting him with a huge right hand and quickly went to work using thunderous elbows during a ground-and-pound before referee Herb Dean stepped in to stop the bout at the 1:20 mark.",
      "Pereira brought an end to Ankalaev\u2019s 14-match unbeaten streak, while exacting revenge for a loss in the fighters\u2019 first meeting in March.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t well that night, but tonight I was very well,\u201d Pereira said through his translator.",
      "Pereira lost to Ankalaev by unanimous decision on March 8, when the judges graded the fight on aggressiveness. This time, Pereira wasted no time in attacking Ankalaev with relentless pressure.",
      "The 38-year-old Brazilian landed 28 of the 45 significant strike attempts, while Ankalaev, 33, was only able to land four of his nine attempts.",
      "Pereira closed +200 at BetMGM Sportsbook, which means a $100 wager would have won $200. A Pereira by KO or TKO in under 2.5 rounds was +475.",
      "While Pereira entered the arena with the sold-out crowd standing and roaring in approval, Ankalaev was greeted by a chorus of boos.",
      "The 19,081 in attendance, which included Golden State Warriors stars Draymond Green and Jimmy Butler and Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua, went into a frenzy the moment Dean stepped in to stop the fight.",
      "Earlier in the night, in what some might have considered a title eliminator bout in the light heavyweight division for the right to face Pereira, second-ranked contender Jiri Prochazka (32-5-1) delivered a brutal left hand at the 3:04 mark of the third round to knock out No. 4 Khalil Rountree Jr. (15-7-0) in what earned the fight of the night.",
      "Pereira had beaten Prochazka twice already, second-round knockouts at UFC 295 and 303.",

      "Josh Hoover threw two of his four touchdowns to Eric McAlister and ran for another score as TCU overcame a two-TD deficit and beat Colorado 35-21",
      "FORT WORTH, Texas -- FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Josh Hoover threw two of his four touchdowns to Eric McAlister and ran for another score as TCU overcame a two-TD deficit and beat Colorado 35-21 on Saturday night in the Buffaloes\u2019 first trip there since coach Deion Sanders\u2019 winning debut with them two years ago.",
      "TCU (4-1, 1-1 Big 12) went ahead for good on Hoover's 18-yard TD to Joseph Manjack IV with 5:44 left. That came only a few plays after a disputed offensive pass interference call wiped out a big fourth-down gain to inside the 5-yard line and forced the Frogs to punt instead. That kick ricocheted off the back of a Colorado player and was recovered by tight end Chase Curtis.",
      "Hoover completed 23 of 33 passes for 275 yards. McAlister had four catches for 65 yards, adding a 21-yard score on a fourth-down play with 19 seconds left. After missing a game because of a hamstring issue, McAlister was back after he had eight catches for 254 yards and three TDs against SMU in the last home game two weeks ago.",
      "The Buffaloes (2-4, 0-3) blew a 14-0 lead for the second week in a row. Kaidon Salter was 18-of-29 passing for 217 yards with two TDs to Omarion Miller. Salter also ran for a score, but threw three interceptions by halftime.",
      "Colorado was in its final Pac-12 season when it pulled off a 45-42 prime-time shocker in the 2023 season opener in Sanders\u2019 much-hyped debut against a TCU squad coming off a national title game appearance. The two teams didn\u2019t play last season in the Buffs' first back in the Big 12 since their departure after 2010, two years before TCU joined the league.",
      "Salter's first throw of the night was an interception. His second pick led to McAlister's 23-yard TD for a 14-14 score just 1:32 before halftime, and only 66 seconds after Hoover's 1-yard TD run. The last interception by Salter came at the goal line on the final play before the break and kept Colorado from being able to regain the lead.",
      "The Buffaloes made it to the TCU 2 after two big plays and a pass interference penalty in the end zone. But Salter\u2019s next throw intended for Miller was intercepted by Namdi Obiazor after being deflected by Jamel Johnson, who had the first interception.",

      "In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers.",
      "The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence.",
      "Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power\u2019s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility's owner.",
      "Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S.",
      "Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power\u2019s operations, strategy and values wouldn\u2019t change under BlackRock and that the deal\u2019s cost wouldn't affect electric rates.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department's attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest.",
      "The commission's chair, Katie Sieben, agreed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we\u2019ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,\u201d Sieben said.",

      "Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group\u2019s \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2014 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with \u201ca high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,\u201d and \u201cassumed the absolute worst in these investors.\u201d But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest.",
      "Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval.",
      "\u201cPrivate equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,\" Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement.

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",

If companies start making more money, they are either going to increase the dividend or invest in new areas. Hopefully, the majority will invest in new areas to create new jobs.",
      "You will see successful companies expand and grow dramatically, but you are probably going to see 50% of the Fortune 500 companies disappear and 50% of the executives of the Fortune 500 disappear. They won\u2019t have the skills to adjust to this new innovation economy driven by AI because they were trained in silos they were trained to move at the speed of a five-year cycle as opposed to a 12-month cycle.",
      "Q: Do you think this is one of the most uncertain times you have ever seen?",
      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",
      "A: Let\u2019s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren\u2019t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.",
      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

      "In the wake of Jane Goodall's death, the many scientists and others influenced by her are promising to do their best to carry on her legacy",
      "In her 91 years, Jane Goodall transformed science and humanity's understanding of our closest living relatives on the planet \u2014 chimpanzees and other great apes. Her patient fieldwork and tireless advocacy for conservation inspired generations of future researchers and activists, especially women and young people, around the world.",
      "Her death on Wednesday set off a torrent of tributes for the famed primate researcher, with many people sharing stories of how Goodall and her work inspired their own careers. The tributes also included pledges to honor Goodall\u2019s memory by redoubling efforts to safeguard a planet that sorely needs it.",
      "\u201cJane Goodall is an icon \u2013 because she was the start of so much,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France.",
      "She recalled how many years ago Goodall answered a letter from a young aspiring researcher. \u201cI wrote her a letter asking how to become a primatologist. She sent back a handwritten letter and told me it will be hard, but I should try,\u201d Crockford said. \u201cFor me, she gave me my career.\u201d",
      "Goodall was one of three pioneering young women studying great apes in the 1960s and 1970s who began to revolutionize the way people understood just what was -- and wasn\u2019t -- unique about our own species. Sometimes called the \u201cTri-mates,\u201d Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas spent years documenting the intimate lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania, mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and orangutans in Indonesia, respectively.",
      "The projects they began have produced some of the longest-running studies about animal behavior in the world that are crucial to understanding such long-lived species. \u201cThese animals are like us, slow to mature and reproduce, and living for decades. We are still learning new things about them,\u201d said Tara Stoinski, a primatologist and president of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. \u201cJane and Dian knew each other and learned from each other, and the scientists who continued their work continue to collaborate today.\u201d",
      "Goodall studied chimpanzees \u2014 as a species and as individuals. And she named them: David Greybeard, Flo, Fifi, Goliath. That was highly unconventional at the time, but Goodall\u2019s attention to individuals created space for scientists to observe and record differences in individual behaviors, preferences and even emotions.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at St. Andrews University who was inspired by Goodall, recalled how Goodall carefully combined empathy and objectivity. Goodall liked to use a particular phrase, \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as happy,\u201d or \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as friends \u2013- these two individuals together,\u201d Hobaiter said. Goodall didn\u2019t project precise feelings onto the chimpanzees, but nor did she deny the capacity of animals besides humans to have emotional lives.",
      "Goodall and her frequent collaborator, evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, had just finished the text of a forthcoming children's book, called \u201cEvery Elephant Has a Name,\u201d which will be published around early 2027.",
      "From the late 1980s until her death, Goodall spent less time in the field and more time on the road talking to students, teachers, diplomats, park rangers, presidents and many others around the world. She inspired countless others through her books. Her mission was to inspire action to protect the natural world.",
      "In 1991, she founded an organization called Roots & Shoots that grew to include chapters of young people in dozens of countries.",
      "Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist and founder of the nonprofit Saving Nature, recalled when he and Goodall were invited to speak to a congressional hearing about deforestation and extinction. Down the marble halls of the government building, \u201cthere was a huge line of teenage girls and their mothers just waiting to get inside the room to hear Jane speak,\u201d Pimm said Thursday. \u201cShe was mobbed everywhere she went -- she was just this incredible inspiration to people in general, particularly to young women.\u201d",
      "Goodall wanted everyone to find their voice, no matter their age or station, said Zanagee Artis, co-founder of the youth climate movement Zero Hour. \u201cI really appreciated how much Jane valued young people being in the room -- she really fostered intergenerational movement building,\u201d said Artis, who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",

      "Portuguese vineyards are harvesting grapes at night to combat rising temperatures",
      "VIMIEIRO, Portugal -- Under a moonlit sky and the glow of headlamps, workers gingerly pluck grape clusters while much of Portugal sleeps.",
      "They harvest in the Alentejo region, sometimes called the \u201cTuscany of Portugal\u201d for its rolling vineyards, olive groves and forests that supply cork for the wines. In this vineyard about a 90-minute drive east of Lisbon, the cool autumn night carries the smell of ripe fruit. The workers' laughter blends with the sound of rustling leaves.",
      "The night harvest is a time-honored practice in viticulture, meant to preserve the freshness of grapes and shield them from the adverse effects of daytime heat, sunlight and oxidation. As summers in Portugal grow longer, hotter and more unpredictable \u2014 in part due to climate change \u2014 the practice has become more common here.",
      "B\u00e1rbara Monteiro, co-owner and manager of the Herdade Da Fonte Santa vineyard said she struggled at first to convince her harvesters to work at night \u2014 midnight to 8 a.m. They began doing so in 2019.",
      "\u201cToday, we can say they actually prefer this schedule, as they can often work almost another day, enjoy the day, and avoid the extreme heat we often experience here,\u201d she said.",
      "The wine harvest in Spain, Italy and Portugal generally takes place between late August and October, with variations based on the region, type of grapes and weather conditions.",
      "Some vineyards have been harvesting at night for years. In parts of Italy, others have for more than a decade. The El Coto de Rioja vineyard in Spain\u2019s famed La Rioja region opts for early morning harvests, beginning at 5 or 6 a.m., according to C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez, the vineyard's technical director and winemaker.",
      "In Portugal's Alentejo region, daytime temperatures particularly in August can reach 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). At night, they can drop by as much as 20 C (36 F) or more.",
      "Grapes are naturally sensitive to temperature shifts. Warmer weather can make them reach sugar maturity before developing a full flavor and ripeness, leading to higher alcohol levels but less complex wines. Intense heat also speeds up acid loss and can trigger early fermentation as wild yeasts and bacteria become more active.",
      "By harvesting at night, vintners can lock in more vibrant flavors that improve the quality of the wine produced.",
      "\u201cClimate change has greatly influenced our harvest and the process and we\u2019ve adapted over the years,\" Monteiro said.",

      "The recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board came after it investigated five fires this year involving the Silverliner IV passenger railcars used by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA.",
      "In addition to suspending operation of the Silverliner IV fleet until it can fix the cause, the agency said SEPTA should fast-track the replacement of the Silverliner IV fleet or retrofit cars to meet modern fire safety standards and add systems to give the train crew detailed information on when dynamic brakes or other electrical systems aren't functioning normally.",
      "All five fires forced everyone aboard to evacuate \u2014 in one case, as many as 350 passengers \u2014 with a few minor injuries reported. One railcar was involved in two of the fires, and two other railcars were destroyed, the NTSB said.",

      "In its report, the NTSB was critical of SEPTA's maintenance and operating practices.",
      "That, combined with the outdated design of the Silverliner IV railcars, \u201crepresents an immediate and unacceptable safety risk because of the incidence and severity of electrical fires that can spread to occupied compartments,\u201d the NTSB said.",
      "The NTSB traced the fires to different components, including electrical components associated with the train\u2019s propulsion system, the dynamic brakes and a traction motor.",

      "It\u2019s official: AOL\u2019s dial-up internet has taken its last bow",
      "NEW YORK -- It's official: AOL's dial-up internet has taken its last bow.",
      "AOL previously confirmed it would be pulling the plug on Tuesday (Sept. 30) \u2014 writing in a brief update on its support site last month that it \u201croutinely evaluates\" its offerings and had decided to discontinue dial-up, as well as associated software \u201coptimized for older operating systems,\u201d from its plans.",
      "Dial-up is now no longer advertised on AOL's website. As of Wednesday, former company help pages like \u201cconnect to the internet with AOL Dialer\u201d appeared unavailable \u2014 and nostalgic social media users took to the internet to say their final goodbyes.",
      "AOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the World Wide Web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s.",
      "The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone line used to connect your computer online \u2014 along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.",
      "Eventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today \u2014 but not everyone.",
      "A handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide.",

Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet's earlier days continue to disappear.",
      "Microsoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year \u2014 as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger \u2014 a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals.",
      "AOL itself is far from the dominant internet player it was decades ago \u2014 when, beyond dial-up and IMs, the company also became known for its \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail\u201d catchphrase that greeted users who checked their inboxes, as famously displayed in the 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan by the same name.",
      "Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL \u2014 which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.",
      "AOL now operates under the larger Yahoo name. A spokesperson for Yahoo didn't have any additional statements about the end of AOL's dial-up when reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday \u2014 directing customers to its previous summer announcement.",
      "At the time Verzion it sold AOL in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was \u201cin the low thousands\" \u2014 down from 2.1 million when Verzion first moved to acquire AOL in 2015, and far below peak demand seen back in the 90s and early 2000s. But beyond dial-up, AOL continues to offer its free email services, as well as subscriptions that advertise identity protection and other tech support.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists have uncovered new types of organics in icy geysers spouting from Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, bolstering the likelihood that the ocean world may harbor conditions suitable for life.",
      "Their findings, reported Wednesday, are based on observations made by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close and fast flyby of Enceladus. The small moon, one of 274 orbiting Saturn, has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",
      "While Enceladus may be habitable, no one is suggesting that life exists.",
      "\u201cBeing habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" said the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study.",

      "These new grains collided with Cassini\u2019s cosmic dust analyzer at 40,000 mph (64,800 kph), faster than the old ones. The increased speed provided a clearer view of the chemical compounds present, the scientists noted.",
      "Organic molecules already had been spotted in the old geyser grains, but their age raised questions as to whether they had been altered over the years by space radiation.",
      "Scientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon\u2019s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.",
      "An ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic. The moon's jets of water vapor and frozen particles can stretch thousands of miles (kilometers) into space.",

      "More online platforms are giving secondhand shopping a digital upgrade, rolling out features like livestream shopping and AI-powered search to make thrifting faster and more exciting.",
      "Although choosing secondhand over new is often the more sustainable option, experts say it\u2019s not a license to overconsume. They warn that resale has its limits, since buying more than you need still fuels waste, and shopping online can add emissions from servers and shipping, thrifted or not.",
      "Here's how industry experts and fashion-forward shoppers shop secondhand sustainably \u2014 and how to find quality pieces that last while looking cool, too.",
      "At eBay\u2019s secondhand runway shows in New York and London, models wore pre-loved designer pieces that guests could shop live. Secondhand items like those make up 40% of the company's sales, said Alexis Hoopes, eBay\u2019s vice president of fashion.",
      "\u201cOne of our big priorities is making secondhand just as good as shopping in the primary market,\" she said.",
      "ThredUp and The RealReal have reported record sales this year, signaling that the online resale market is growing quickly. Live-auction apps like Whatnot are giving shoppers more platforms to bid on used clothing.",
      "Shoppers navigating growing online options with an eye toward sustainability can still end up buying more than they need.",
      "\u201cPeople who buy secondhand clothing were found to buy more clothing than people who don\u2019t,\u201d said Meital Peleg Mizrachi, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University who researches textile waste. \u201cNot only that, they tend to get rid of those clothes faster than other consumers. So they\u2019re ending up creating more textile waste because they\u2019re buying more and using that clothing for a shorter period of time.\u201d",
      "Less than 20% of clothing donations to charities are resold in their stores, according to the Council for Textile Recycling. The rest is downcycled, exported \u2014 often to countries in the Global South \u2014 or ultimately discarded in landfills.",

    "summary": "Scientists warn that &ldquo;flying rivers&rdquo; &mdash; invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon &mdash; are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
    "story": [
      "Scientists warn that \u201cflying rivers\u201d \u2014 invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon \u2014 are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible \u201cflying rivers\u201d carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.",
      "New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna \u2014 grassland with far fewer trees.",
      "\u201cThese are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation\u2019s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.\u201d",
      "Most of the Amazon\u2019s rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.",
      "Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the \u201cflying rivers\u201d term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.",
      "That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.",
      "The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes \u2014 precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru\u2019s Manu National Park.",
      "\u201cPeru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.\u201d",
      "Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.",
      "Corine Vriesendorp, Amazon Conservation\u2019s director of science based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.",
      "\u201cThe last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,\u201d Vriesendorp said. \u201cEcological calendars that Indigenous communities use \u2014 when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce \u2014 are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.\u201d",
      "Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up.",
      "MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong.",

      "But in the dry season \u2014 when forests are already stressed by heat \u2014 the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during the dry months, when the forest most needs water, that the flying rivers are most disrupted,\u201d Finer said.",
      "Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil \u2014 a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon \u2014 could create an entirely new deforestation front.",
      "For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a single, all-at-once collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we\u2019re already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water.",
      "\u201cThe dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there\u2019s no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.\u201d",
      "Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.",
      "\u201cTo avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires \u2014 immediately,\u201d Nobre said. \u201cAnd we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.\u201d",
      "Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers \u2014 safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.",
      "For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, \u201cthis can\u2019t be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.\u201d",

      "New York City is trying to deter dangerous \u201csubway surfing\u201d through education programs, but some transportation advocates and lawmakers say it's not enough",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Ka\u2019Von Wooden loved trains. The 15-year-old had an encyclopedic knowledge of New York City\u2019s subway system and dreamed of becoming a train operator.",
      "Instead, on a December morning in 2022, Ka\u2019Von died after he climbed to the roof of a moving J train in Brooklyn and then fell onto the tracks as it headed onto the Williamsburg Bridge.",
      "He is one of more than a dozen New Yorkers, many young boys, who have been killed or badly injured after falling off speeding trains. Other risks include being crushed between the train and tunnel walls and being electrocuted by high-voltage subway tracks. \u201cSubway surfing\u201d dates back a century but it has been fueled by social media.",
      "Early Saturday morning, New York City police found two girls dead \u2014 ages 12 and 13 \u2014 in what apparently was a subway surfing game that turned out to be fatal, authorities said. Metropolitan Transportation Authority President Demetrius Crichlow said in a statement that \"getting on top of a subway car isn\u2019t \u2018surfing\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s suicide.\u201d",
      "Authorities have tried to address the problem with public awareness campaigns \u2014 including a new one featuring Grammy Award-winning rapper Cardi B \u2014 and by deploying drones to catch thrill-seekers in the act. But for some, a more fundamental question is not being addressed: Why are kids like Ka\u2019Von able to climb on top of subway cars in the first place?",
      "\u201cWhen Ka\u2019Von died ... literally two weeks later, another child died. And another one. That makes no sense,\u201d his mother, Y\u2019Vonda Maxwell, told The Associated Press, saying transit and law enforcement officials haven\u2019t done enough. \u201cWhy should my child have not been the end?\u201d",
      "Making trains harder to climb, and train surfers more easy to detect with cameras and sensors, could be part of the solution, some experts say. The MTA, which operates the subway system, has said it is studying the issue. But it has yet to report any broad new rollout of technology or physical barriers that might make it harder for people to get on top of trains.",
      "In June, Crichlow told a news conference to introduce a new public awareness campaign that the MTA was experimenting with pieces of circular rubber tubing designed to prevent a person from being able to climb between two cars to the top of a train.",
      "It was being piloted in between two cars to make sure it would fit into the tight spacing of the tunnels and that it wouldn't break down or harm service or riders, he said.",
      "\u201cSo far the equipment seems to be holding up,\u201d he said.",
      "Six people died surfing subway trains in the city last year, up from five in 2023.",
      "Tyesha Elcock, the MTA worker who operated the train Ka\u2019Von rode the day he died, is among those who thinks more should be done to prevent deaths.",
      "The first sign of trouble that day was when the train\u2019s emergency brake kicked in, she said.",
      "Elcock discovered Ka'Von's body between the train's seventh and eighth cars. A group of sad-faced teens on the train made it clear what had happened. \u201cDid y\u2019all leave your friend back there?\" she asked them.",
      "Elcock said another operator traveling in the opposite direction saw Ka\u2019Von on the train's roof and reported it over a radio. Because of patchy radio service, she said, she didn't get the warning.",
      "But she thinks an even simpler solution could have saved Ka\u2019Von\u2019s life: locking the doors at the ends of subway cars. That would cut off access to the narrow gaps between train cars where subway surfers use handholds to hoist themselves onto the roof.",
      "\u201cLock it when we\u2019re in service so people can\u2019t climb up and be on top of the train,\u201d Elcock said.",

But he said that locking doors \u201cbrings its own risk.\u201d Some New Yorkers have complained that locking the passageways between train cars might prevent them from escaping to another part of the train during an emergency.",
      "Under questioning from City Council members and reporters last year, MTA officials ruled out some other physical interventions, including building more barriers to prevent access to tracks, or putting covers over the gaps between train cars to prevent would-be surfers from climbing up.",
      "\u201cListen, you have to be able to do work on top of a train car,\u201d MTA CEO Janno Lieber said at a news conference, adding that you can\u2019t \u201ccover it with barbed wire.\u201d",

But your taxes would go up tremendously.\u2019 And people say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Dimitrijevic said.",
      "Dimitrijevic suggested the MTA might be able to install cameras and use artificial intelligence to detect riders trying to climb a train. Andrew Albert, a nonvoting member of the MTA board, said he has been asking the agency about the plausibility of physical sensors but hasn\u2019t gotten a response.",
      "The NYPD has patrolled popular subway surfing routes with field response teams and drones, reporting in July that it had used them to make 200 rescues, mostly of teens. But the missions can\u2019t be everywhere at once. They also say they make home visits to the homes of subway surfers they've identified.",

      "Some rail systems have resorted to extreme tactics to keep people from riding on top of trains. In Indonesia, railway officials once installed hanging metal flails to try and deter passengers from riding atop train cars to avoid overcrowding. They also tried spraying riders with red paint and hitting them with brooms.",
      "The MTA purchased a few new subway cars that don\u2019t have the outdoor gaps exploited by subway surfers, but they represent just a sliver of the number currently in service, and won\u2019t be deployed on lines popular for surfing anytime soon.",

      "The Washington, D.C., judge found that such automatic detention violates a court order he issued in 2021 barring such practices.",
      "ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately respond Saturday to emails seeking comment.",
      "The push to detain new adults is yet another battle over one of the most sensitive issues in President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration agenda \u2014 how to treat children who cross the border unaccompanied by adults.",
      "The Associated Press reported Friday that officials are offering migrant children age 14 and older $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries. Last month a separate federal judge blocked attempts to immediately deport Guatemalan migrant children who came to the U.S. alone back to their home country. Some children had been put on board planes in that late-night operation before a judge blocked it.",
      "\u201cAll of these are pieces of the same general policy to coerce immigrant youth into giving up their right to seek protection in the United States,\u201d said Michelle Lapointe, a lawyer for the American Immigration Council, one of the groups that asked Contreras to intervene in a filing made just after midnight Saturday.",
      "Unaccompanied children are held in shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which isn't part of ICE. Contreras' 2021 order instructed federal officials to release minors who turn 18 from those shelters to \u201cthe least restrictive setting available.\" He ruled that is what's required by federal law as long as the minor isn't a danger to themselves or others and isn't a flight risk. Minors are often released to the custody of a relative, or maybe into foster care.",

One email from ICE asserted that the new adults could only be released by ICE under its case-by-case parole authority for \u201curgent humanitarian reasons\u201d or \u201csignificant public benefit.\u201d From March through September, ICE has paroled fewer than 500 people overall.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that \u201crelease on parole is all but a dead letter\u201d and that children aging out of shelters would experience lasting harm from unnecessary and inappropriate adult detention\" in jails that might be overcrowded or in remote locations. The plaintiffs said that was especially true because some of the clients they cited had been victims of trafficking or had been abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents.",
      "U.S. border authorities have arrested children crossing the border without parents more than 400,000 times since October 2021. A 2008 law requires them to appear before an immigration judge before being returned to their countries.",

      "The additional scrutiny includes fingerprinting, DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers. Over the summer, immigration officers started showing up and arresting parents.",
      "The average length of stay at government-run shelters for those released in the U.S. was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.",

Davis, a Leesburg, Georgia, resident, was also indicted on three misdemeanors, including reckless operation of a vessel, failing to follow boating rules and boating without a boater safety certification.",
      "Video shows Davis' boat speeding across Lewis Smith Lake, a popular recreational destination about 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Birmingham, striking another boat, and launching into the air. Officials say Joey M. Broom, 58, of Snead, Alabama, was fatally injured in the collision. John K. Clark, 44, of Cullman, Alabama, and Jeffrey C.

      "The crash happened while Davis was fishing in the second day of the Tackle Warehouse Invitational, a bass fishing tournament put on by Major League Fishing. The others weren't part of the tournament, but taking part in a company-sponsored fishing trip.",
      "Although investigators determined Davis' boat was traveling at 67 mph (108 kph) at the time of the crash, Alabama Marine Patrol Chief Matt Brooks said at the news conference that speed was not a factor in the crash. Instead, he said the wreck was caused by \u201coperator inattention, distraction, not paying attention, failing to keep a proper lookout.\u201d",
      "Brooks said investigators found that \u201cMr. Davis clearly did not see\u201d the other boat. He also said that Davis didn't have the required license to operate a motorized boat in either Georgia or Alabama.",

      "BURLINGTON, Vt. -- BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) \u2014 As a Greek immigrant who came to the United States in 1956, Nectar Rorris never imagined the Vermont restaurant and music club he opened 50 years ago would become synonymous with Phish, but he credits the jam band with giving Nectar\u2019s a national spotlight and making it a place sought out by local and traveling musicians alike.",
      "\u201cPhish made Nectar's,\u201d the 86-year-old Rorris said recently.",
      "Phish meanwhile credits Rorris with their early success, giving them a stage to experiment on when they were starting out in the early '80s.",
      "But now, the iconic Burlington venue that fostered a community of diverse artists has closed its doors, despite negotiations to keep the music going.",
      "Nectar\u2019s announced it was taking a pause in June, citing \u201cimmense challenges affecting both downtown Burlington and the local live music and entertainment scene.\u201d Several weeks later, the venue announced on social media that it was closing for good. The post immediately drew hundreds of comments and tributes from musicians, former employees and fans.",
      "\u201cAs a musician, you want to move up. You get a few fans; you go to a bigger club. That\u2019s what Nectar\u2019s was,\u201d said Chris Farnsworth, who covers Burlington\u2019s music scene for the Vermont newspaper Seven Days.",
      "Farnsworth noted that the venue \u2014 a brick building with a neon sign \u2014 \u201cholds a very important place\u201d in Phish lore. The band's 1992 record was titled \u201cA Picture of Nectar\u201d as a tribute to the venue and to Rorris, who gave the fledgling band a residency for nearly two years.",
      "\u201cThe guys from Phish were very good to us,\u201d said Alex Budney, who started at Nectar\u2019s in 2001 as a cook when he was 19, making their famous gravy fries and later working almost every job in the building over 20 years.",
      "\u201cMy college band would play there on Monday nights and it would be like nobody there. But the keyboard player from Phish would come down in a snowstorm and sit at the bar and watch us play and talk to us,\u201d Budney said.",
      "Phish bassist Mike Gordon, who still lives in the area, even popped in during singer-songwriter Maggie Rose\u2019s sound check last September and joined her band for two songs that night. Rose had rerouted her tour just to be able to play at Nectar\u2019s.",
      "\u201cIt was the perfect excuse to go to this legendary venue in this amazing, creative, artistic town,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThe lore of Nectar\u2019s did not disappoint. It truly was just one of those surreal moments.\u201d",

Eventually, his partners wanted to move on, so the three sold the business to a new owner who only lasted six months. Rorris decided to buy the business back and ran it by himself until 2003, when he decided to sell for personal reasons.",
      "\u201cThe bands were real thrilled to see that I was taking it back and that I was going to hire them back,\" he said. \"From then, it took off.\u201d",

And it was known for regular music series including Metal Mondays; Dead Set Tuesdays \u2014 a tribute to The Grateful Dead; blues, jazz and reggae nights; comedy shows and Sunday Night Mass, a production showcasing electronic artists from around the world.",
      "Nectar\u2019s ownership and management changed repeatedly, but it remained a place to discover new music. Budney said Nectar's supported emerging artists with residency opportunities to play weekly for a month or more and build a fan base.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d provide tools for bands to make it,\u201d he said.",

      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is convening Saturday for its twice-annual general conference at a pivotal moment in its history",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is convening Saturday for its twice-annual general conference at a pivotal moment in its history: just days after the death of its oldest-ever president and a deadly attack on a congregation in Michigan.",
      "The death of President Russell M. Nelson leaves a void, but the church has a well-defined leadership hierarchy that helps ensure a smooth transition. Dallin H. Oaks, the man set to succeed Nelson, has already played a prominent role in church leadership as one of Nelson's two top counselors. Oaks' expected ascension to the presidency is likely to be announced after Nelson's funeral, scheduled for Tuesday, a couple of days after the conference when about 100,000 members gather at the church's headquarters in Utah.",
      "The 200-year-old denomination known widely as the Mormon church has not held a general conference without a president for at least a century, but there's no leadership vacuum, said Patrick Mason, a professor of religious studies and history at Utah State University.",
      "A governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, headed by Oaks, is leading the church and its more than 17 million members worldwide in the absence of a president, much like Brigham Young\u2019s role for more than two years following church founder Joseph Smith\u2019s death in 1844.",
      "In the 19th century, it was common for a couple years to pass before a new president was named. The Quorum again led the church for lengthy periods after Young's death in 1877 and John Taylor's death in 1887.",
      "The last time a church president died just before a general conference was in April 1951, with the death of George Albert Smith. His funeral was folded into the conference and a new president was formally announced during the gathering.",
      "Today, it is not uncommon for a living president to miss a conference for health reasons, especially given their ages. At 93, Oaks will be among the oldest presidents. Seven of the past nine have served into their nineties, including five beyond Oaks\u2019 current age. Nelson lived to be 101.",
      "Nelson's absence is expected to be felt as thousands gather in person this weekend and many more tune in remotely from around the world. The two-day conference features sermons and serves as a unifying time for the faith\u2019s global membership. Church officials often address major issues of the moment while leaving some room for members to interpret religious doctrine for themselves.",
      "\u201cI think Nelson\u2019s shadow will hang heavy over the conference,\u201d said Matthew Bowman, an expert on U.S. religious history at Claremont Graduate University.",
      "The president \u2014 considered a prophet by members \u2014 traditionally speaks at general conference, and it is considered an event highlight during which new initiatives and policies have been announced. Nelson often used the time to announce the construction of new temples, one of his main enterprises as president. He was charismatic, sentimental and frequently quoted by other conference speakers, which Bowman expects will continue this weekend as they honor his legacy.",
      "In addition to Nelson's death, the faithful have been reeling from the attack on one of their congregations in Michigan last weekend. Four people were killed inside a church in Grand Blanc Township after a gunman rammed his pickup truck into the house of worship, shot at congregants and set a fire that destroyed a lot of the building. The gunman, who was killed by police, was described by friends as having a grudge against the church.",

      "Experts do not expect this conference to look all that different, but they will be watching closely to see what Oaks says. At past conferences, he has been the most likely to address political issues, Bowman said.",
      "Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court justice, is known for his jurist sensibilities and traditionalist convictions on marriage and religious freedom. He has been a driving force in the church against same-sex marriage and in upholding a teaching that homosexuality is a sin, creating anxiety among LGBTQ+ members and their allies.",
      "Oaks also has been outspoken about maintaining civil discourse and denouncing violence, which could again be a focus this weekend.",
      "\u201cEven before the recent shooting, I would not have been surprised to see him address either issues of religious freedom or of civility,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cBut now, given the new responsibilities approaching him, I might expect him to take a longer view and speak to more broad issues of Christianity, eternity and so on.\"",

      "A federal appeals court in Boston has ruled the Trump administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily",
      "BOSTON -- BOSTON (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court in Boston ruled on Friday that the Trump administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily, adding to the mounting legal setbacks for the president\u2019s birthright order.",
      "A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals became the fifth federal court since June to either issue or uphold orders blocking the president\u2019s birthright order. The court concluded that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims that the children described in the order are entitled to birthright citizenship under the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "The panel upheld lower courts' preliminary injunctions, which blocked the birthright order while lawsuits challenging it moved ahead. The order, signed the day the president took office in January, would halt automatic citizenship for babies born to people in the U.S. illegally or temporarily.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018lessons of history\u2019 thus give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one\u2019s parents rather than \u2014 in all but the rarest of circumstances \u2014 the simple fact of being born in the United States,\u201d the court wrote.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta, whose state was one of nearly 20 that were part of the lawsuit challenging the order, welcomed the ruling.",
      "\u201cThe First Circuit reaffirmed what we already knew to be true: The President\u2019s attack on birthright citizenship flagrantly defies the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and a nationwide injunction is the only reasonable way to protect against its catastrophic implications,\u201d Bonta said in a statement. \u201cWe are glad that the courts have continued to protect Americans\u2019 fundamental rights.\u201d",
      "A second appeals court ruling on Friday also found in favor of several organizations that challenged the birthright citizenship order. The plaintiffs, including New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support and League of United Latin American Citizens, were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cThe federal appeals court today reinforced that this executive order is a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 and we agree,\u201d said SangYeob Kim, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire. \u201cOur Constitution is clear: no politician can decide who among those born in this country is worthy of citizenship.\u201d",
      "In September, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to uphold its birthright citizenship order. The appeal sets in motion a process at the high court that could lead to a definitive ruling from the justices by early summer on whether the citizenship restrictions are constitutional.",
      "\u201cThe court is misinterpreting the 14th Amendment. We look forward to being vindicated by the Supreme Court,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "In July, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston issued the third court ruling blocking the birthright order nationwide after a key Supreme Court decision in June. Less than two weeks later, a federal judge in Maryland also issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the order. The issue is expected to move quickly back to the nation\u2019s highest court.",

      "At the heart of the lawsuits challenging the birthright order is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens.",
      "Plaintiffs in the Boston case \u2014 one of the cases the 1st Circuit considered \u2014 told Sorokin that the principle of birthright citizenship is \u201censhrined in the Constitution,\u201d and that Trump does not have the authority to issue the order, which they called a \u201cflagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\u201d",

      "A judge has announced that the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others will be dismissed in 14 days if a new prosecutor isn't appointed",
      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The judge overseeing the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others says he will dismiss the case in 14 days if a new prosecutor hasn't been appointed to take it over.",
      "Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee set the deadline in a one-paragraph order Friday afternoon. It is up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia to name a prosecutor for the case after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified from continuing the prosecution.",
      "\u201cShould an appointed prosecuting attorney or representative of PAC fail to file an entry of appearance or request a particularized extension within 14 days from the entry of this Notice, the Court will issue a dismissal without prejudice for want of prosecution,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "\u201cWe have received the order and are reviewing it to provide a response to the court,\u201d Prosecuting Attorneys' Council spokesperson Tracy Walston said in an email.",
      "When Willis announced the indictment against Trump and 18 others in August 2023, the nearly 100-page indictment was the most sweeping of four criminal cases brought against the then-former president in a span of five months. She used the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to allege a wide-ranging conspiracy to try to illegally overturn Trump\u2019s narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.",
      "Even if a new prosecutor is named within the two-week deadline it is unlikely that any prosecution against Trump could move forward while he is the sitting president. But there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.",

      "If a new prosecutor is named, that person could continue on the track that Willis had charted, decide to pursue only some charges or dismiss the case altogether.",
      "Defense attorneys sought Willis' removal after one of them revealed in January 2024 that Willis had engaged in a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she had hired to lead the case. The defense attorneys said the relationship created a conflict of interest, alleging that Willis personally profited from the case when Wade used his earnings to pay for vacations the pair took.",
      "During an extraordinary hearing the following month, Willis and Wade both testified about the intimate details of their personal relationship. They maintained that their romance didn't begin until after Wade was hired and said that they split the costs for vacations and other outings.",
      "McAfee rebuked Willis, saying in an order in March 2024 that her actions showed a \u201ctremendous lapse in judgment.\u201d But he said he did not find a conflict of interest that would disqualify Willis. He ultimately ruled that Willis could remain on the case if Wade resigned, which the special prosecutor did hours later.",
      "Defense attorneys appealed that ruling, and the Georgia Court of Appeals removed Willis from the case in December, citing an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d The high court last month declined to hear Willis' appeal, putting the case in the lap of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council.",

      "The salvagers get to walk away with most of the artifacts, following negotiations with state officials.",

      "Then, staffers will use magnification and high resolution photography to document the nuances of each coin, including any markings showing the date, monarch and minter associated with it, along with the weight and location where it was found.

      "GREENBELT, Md. -- GREENBELT, Md. (AP) \u2014 A California resident who attempted to assassinate U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his Maryland home was sentenced Friday to over eight years in prison by a federal judge, who imposed a punishment that is significantly more lenient than the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation.",
      "Sophie Roske, a transgender woman charged under her legal name, Nicholas Roske, had faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman sentenced her to eight years and one month behind bars followed by a lifetime of court supervision. Prosecutors had asked for a prison sentence of no less than 30 years, which was the low end of the range recommended by sentencing guidelines.",
      "Roske, then 26, had a pistol, a knife, zip ties and burglary tools in her possession when a taxi dropped her off outside Kavanaugh\u2019s home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, just after 1 a.m. on June 8, 2022. Noticing two U.S. Marshals Service deputies guarding the residence, Roske kept walking down the street and took a phone call from her sister. Then she dialed 911, reported having suicidal and homicidal thoughts and said she needed psychiatric help.",
      "The judge said law enforcement didn't know anything about Roske's plot until she called 911 and reported her crime unprompted. Boardman described Roske's conduct as \u201creprehensible\u201d but credited her with abandoning the plot before police detected her presence in Kavanaugh's neighborhood.",
      "\u201cThis is an atypical defendant in an atypical case,\u201d she said.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will appeal \"the woefully insufficient sentence ... which does not reflect the horrific facts of this case.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a disgusting attack against our entire judicial system by a profoundly disturbed individual,\u201d Bondi said in a statement.",

      "\u201cHe's a justice of the Supreme Court, but he's a human being,\u201d the judge said.",
      "After her arrest, Roske told investigators she was angry about a leaked draft opinion suggesting the Supreme Court intended to overrule Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case, according to an FBI affidavit. Roske also was upset about the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, and believed Kavanaugh would vote to loosen gun control laws, the affidavit said.",
      "Roske\u2019s case underscores the pervasive threat of political violence in a polarized nation: The number of threats and \u201cinappropriate communications\u201d directed at federal judges and other court employees more than quadrupled over a seven-year span, from 926 incidents in 2015 to 4,511 in 2021, according to the Marshals Service.",
      "Roske targeted three of the high court\u2019s justices, prosecutors said. Killing one judge could change the decisions of the nine-member court \u201cfor decades to come,\u201d Roske wrote over an encrypted messaging platform to another user in May 2022. Roske added, \u201cI am shooting for 3.\u201d",
      "Roske, 29, of Simi Valley, California, searched the internet for justices\u2019 home addresses and other information, including techniques for breaking into homes and quietly killing somebody. Roske also wrote about killing judges in encrypted messages.",

      "Signs will be updated to reinforce existing warnings and eligibility requirements to help visitors decide if they should go on the dual-launch coaster, which reaches speeds up to 62 mph (100 kph), Karen Irwin, president and chief operating officer at Universal Orlando Resort, said Friday in a memo to workers. The ride will reopen on Saturday.",
      "The family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala publicly had urged Universal not to reopen the ride until all investigations were finished and they had a better understanding of how he died. The medical examiner for the Orlando area ruled the cause of death as multiple blunt impact injuries and said the manner of death was an accident. The full autopsy report hasn't been made public.",

TPS is granted in 18-month increments.",

      "\"You have to admit, I've been misunderstood,\" said singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam. \"Even when I wrote 'Foreigner,' I started with the words, There are no words I can use because the meaning still leaves for you to choose. And so, the artist, to try and explain himself, has got to work a bit harder.\"",
      "In a way, music was a by-product of a lifelong search, says Islam (also known as Cat Stevens), who met with us backstage in London.",
      "I asked, \"Do you get something out of playing on stage that you don't, playing alone?\"",
      "\"I get scared,\" he replied. \"A lot of human beings out there!\"",
      "But this musical giant who got his start in the 1960s, and is now in his late 70s, can still move a crowd.",
      "Nicole Perry Ellis came to London's Hyde Park with her daughter Natasha to attend a Yusuf concert. She described it as a \"very emotional moment. Because before [Natasha] was born, we used to listen to the music when I was pregnant.\"",
      "Natasha described Yusuf as timeless: \"He has spirit, he has soul, and it transcends.\"",
      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",
      "\"Do you think you would have been as successful as Stephen Demetre Georgiou?\" I asked.",
      "\"There's no \u2026 you can't play with fate,\" he replied.",
      "In his new memoir, \"Cat on the Road to Findout,\" he explores family, faith, career, and ego.",
      "He writes that reaching superstardom in his teens was quite difficult. \"The problem with success is that it kind of detaches you from reality in some sense,\" he said. \"Who are you? Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",
      "\"Let's get off this subject, please,\" Yusuf said.",
      "\"You bring it up in the book, so it seems \u2013 \"",
      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",
      "\"Really? That's nice to know. I tried to be honest in my writing of songs, and in the writing of my book.\"",
      "This singer-songwriter who once gave up fame for faith has now found his balance, performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens.",
      "Asked how it is to be performing using both names, Yusuf/Cat Stevens replied, \"Actually, it's very symbolic in a way, because for a long time what I wanted to do was to separate myself in a way from my past, and I did that. So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves.

      "He has been called the greatest actor of his generation \u2013 a three-time Oscar-winner, and reluctant star. \"The work itself has always been, has remained nothing but a source of fascination and pleasure to me, the work itself,\" said Daniel Day-Lewis. \"The aftermath of the work has always been difficult for me. You know, you become to some extent a sales rep for that work. And I'm not good at that. I never was. And I'm still not. And that particular part of it, the public part of it, has always left me feeling emptied out.\"",
      "And eight years ago, he announced his retirement. But now, a clarification: \"I think that was a mistake,\" he said. \"I think it just created a kind of confusion. At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",
      "It was part musical interlude: \"My youngest son, Cashel, is a fiddle player. And once the idea took root in my head, like, 'I wonder if I could make him a fiddle,' that was the \u2014 you know, things tend to, yeah, it's hard to let go of a thing.\"",
      "He made three, and he says he has the makings of a fourth, \"but I just haven't got down to it yet.\"",
      "Day-Lewis admits he was surprised to feel a strong impulse to return to acting: \"And largely it was in response to the knowledge that Ronan would be making films.\"",
      "Twenty-seven-year-old middle son Ronan Day-Lewis brings credentials and expectations: His mother, filmmaker and author Rebecca Miller, and grandfather, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "I asked Ronan, \"Was your move to film a surprise to your parents?\"",
      "\"Not really, because I started making little movies with my friends when I was, like, seven,\" he replied. \"When I was really young, I would always be the one kind of annoyingly trying to corral everyone into making a little movie on our dad's, like, flip camera in the backyard or something.\"",
      "\"Anemone\" is his directorial debut, co-written with his father, who plays Ray Stoker. The story unfolds in a remote cabin. Ronan said, \"The first kind of concrete anchor, I think, was the idea of this man who's kind of in this form of self-exile, that he's living in the middle of nowhere. For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",
      "After twenty years, his brother (played by Sean Bean) arrives to bring Ray Stoker back to the son he's never met. Daniel said, \"I felt I knew Ray fairly early on in the writing process. I don't know why I did. I just did. I can't explain it.\"",

      "I asked what drives him to such perfection.",
      "\"I've resisted analysis to a large extent because, maybe out of superstition, I thought it might interfere with the impulse, which was strong in me and still is,\" Daniel replied. \"But I mean, put on the spot I'd say it's got something to do with that period of time which was very bleak in my life when I was sent away to school.\"",
      "His mother, actress Jill Balcon, came from a prominent British film family. His father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who died when Daniel was 15, was well-known in literary circles \u2013 perhaps not so well-known at home.",
      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",
      "He seems to have found a comfortable place at the crossroad in \"Anemone\":\u00a0 a reluctant father on film, and devoted father off-camera.",
      "\"Anemone\" is the culmination of a yearslong father-son collaboration.",
      "I asked Ronan about the trust and confidence implied in that collaboration. \"Yeah, yeah, he never implied that that was a big deal,\" he replied. \"But I always felt that incredible sense of pressure, not wanting to let him down.

      "An unexpected return eagerly awaited. Yet, Daniel Day-Lewis is muted in his expectations: \"We don't last long.

    "summary": "The \"Hannah Montana\" actress-turned-Grammy-winning pop star talks about her album \"Something Beautiful,\" sobriety, and reconnecting with her dad through music.",
    "story": [
      "Miley Cyrus has been in the public eye for most of her life, and while you might know her music, don't think you really know her.",
      "Asked what it's like to go through life and have strangers think they know her, Cyrus replied, \"I love my life, so I don't ever really have \u2013 I haven't made too much of a list of the things that are negative about it, 'cause there's so many great things. But I would say one of the things that I don't love and don't appreciate so much is when you meet somebody and they go, 'Wow, you're like, so cool. You're so smart. You're nothing like I thought you would be.' So yeah, that's a tough one.\"",
      "Her ninth album might not be what you'd expect, either. In \"Something Beautiful,\" Cyrus stretches herself artistically. As one critic put it, the album takes her from pop princess to legacy artist. That's quite a leap, even for someone with music in their blood.",
      "Miley's mom, Tish Cyrus Purcell, is a producer. Dad is country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Her godmother? Dolly Parton.",
      "Miley Cyrus lived with showbiz royalty, and that raspy voice, all her life: \"I've sounded like this since I was little. My dad used to have all the country singers come over to the house, and George Jones would, you know, joke that I had smoked cigarettes or been up all night, you know, even when I was four years old.\"",
      "At age 13, she was suddenly famous after being cast as \"Hannah Montana,\" in the Disney Channel series about a girl who was a typical teen by day and a pop star by night. It's a role she's still proud of: \"I love her. She's everything. I would have nothing, none of this \u2013 I mean, maybe I could've figured it out, maybe I could've gotten myself from Nashville, Tennessee, to Los Angeles. I don't know. But she did it a lot faster, and better, and set me up for the life that I have now. So love her, gratitude, all of that.\"",
      "The years after \"Hannah Montana\" were a bit less wholesome. Her 2013 MTV Music Video Awards performance was met with shock and outrage, especially among moms of young kids who had grown up watching her as a Disney star.",
      "I asked, \"There were moms that were trying to, I guess, cancel you?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess.\"",
      "\"How would you describe that time in your life?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I didn't know until I was older actually how brutal it really was,\" Cyrus said. \"It was very, I guess, you know, challenging for other people. But for me it was a good time. It looked fun, and it was fun.\"",
      "Eventually it was all a little too much fun. Cyrus says she's been sober for a few years now.",
      "\"How has sobriety affected you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I like showing up 100%, 100% of the time,\" Cyrus replied. \"The hardest part about balancing, you know, any sort of substance use or drinking when you want to do what I do is you're going, 'Okay, well, now I have to get sober for this thing, 'cause I wanna show up my best.' And now, I get to trim out so much of the preparation of getting yourself into the right place mentally and physically. I'm just always ready.\"",
      "Something she was ready for: \"Flowers,\" the biggest pop single of 2023, and her biggest record to date.",
      "She was also ready for this: Her first two Grammys, for best pop solo performance and record of the year, for \"Flowers.\" Accepting the Grammy she said, \"This award is amazing, but I hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday.\"",
      "For Miley Cyrus, today is looking good as well.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" joined her this summer at L.A.'s Million Dollar Theatre, where she was shooting a music video for the deluxe version of \"Something Beautiful.\" The song is \"Secrets,\" and if you think it sounds a bit like Fleetwood Mac, you're right: you can hear drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on the track.",
      "Miley sings about a white flag of surrender, and her outfit is basically a white flag in itself. She told us the song is meant as a peace offering to her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. They'd been estranged since her parents' divorce in 2022.",
      "Asked how he reacted when she gave him the song, Miley replied, \"My dad cried. You know, you don't see your dad cry a lot. But with me and my dad, we just have always communicated better through music with each other.\"",
      "\"And you're at peace now with each other?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "And at 32, it seems Miley Cyrus is at peace with herself.",
      "\"I think the authentic joy of doing what I want to do has always eclipsed the negatives for me,\" she said. \"I feel really good. And I really like who I am, and I like what I'm doing with my life. And I think if I was outside of myself, I would want to be a part of what I'm doing in any way that I could be. 'Cause I think what I'm doing is cool. So, that actually feels good. I like what I do. I like who I am.\"",

      "Swift is the only female musical artist in history to sell more than 100 million albums. Her newest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" created a frenzy when it was released Friday.",
      "\"In terms of a business person, Taylor is at the top,\" said Kevin Evers, author of the new book \"There's Nothing Like This: The Strategic Genius of Taylor Swift,\" and a senior editor at the Harvard Business Review. \"She's always been extremely business savvy, and we can see this with this release, too.\"",

      "\"This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and, and vibrant,\" Swift said on the podcast.",
      "Since then, countdowns on her website appeared for limited edition vinyl records, CDs and cardigans, all of which sold out within minutes. \u00a0 \"I mean, she's definitely going to make a lot of money from this album, and she's not shy about that,\" Evers said. \"But at the same time, the reason why all these strategies are working is because her fans are actively engaged.\"",

      "The album became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day this year.

      "Through her groundbreaking observations while living among chimpanzees in the jungles of Tanzania, anthropologist and conservationist Jane Goodall (April 3, 1934-Oct. 1, 2025) transformed the study of the animal world after witnessing chimps fashioning and using tools, which at the time was believed to be unique to humans. Her field research also documented the distinct personalities of the chimps she studied. Through her books, articles, documentary films and public appearances over six decades, Goodall changed how the world perceived homo sapien's closest relative in all their emotional and social complexity.",
      "Her fascination with animals began in childhood, spending hours in a tree reading \"Tarzan.\" \"There was no TV back then,\" Goodall told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021. \"That's when my dream began. I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it. No intention of being a scientist, because girls didn't do that sort of thing.\"",
      "Working in Nairobi as an assistant to Louis Leakey, the paleoanthropologist raised money for Goodall to spend six months studying chimpanzees in the Gombe rain forest in Tanzania bringing her \"fresh pair of eyes and fiery spirit,\" she said. \"I clearly was passionate. I clearly had an understanding of animals. And he felt that women might be better in the field, that we might be more patient. Also, he wanted somebody who hadn't been to college, so he wanted an unbiased mind.\"",
      "Living among the chimpanzees, she eventually gained the animals' trust. She witnessed chimps fashioning and using tools \u2014 using twigs to fish for termites. She also detected chimps having distinct personalities and share \"human\" emotions, like pleasure, sadness and fear. She documented the bond between mother and child, and sibling rivalry. \"A lot of people refused to believe it,\" Goodall said. \"Why should they believe this young girl? She hadn't even been to college!\"",
      "But National Geographic sent cameraman Hugo van Lawick, and his film corroborated her findings. He also photographed Goodall \u2014 and became her husband.",
      "She later founded the Jane Goodall Institute, and devoted decades of her life to education about and advocacy for protecting the environment. She gave lectures and toured; she was typically on the road 300 days a year, and was in California on a speaking tour when she died.",
      "Four years ago, Goodall was asked by \"Sunday Morning\" why she persisted in such a grueling schedule. \"Because there's a message to get out, and I'm getting older, and there's less time left ahead of me, and the world's falling to pieces,\" she replied. \"Everybody can do something. I mean, when you go shopping you can ask yourself, 'Hmm, did this product harm the environment when it was made? Was it cruel to animals? Is it cheap?\u00a0Why\u00a0is it cheap? Is it cheap because of unfair wages? \u2026 If they care about the future, especially if they've got children, you don't have to do it all. You know, even if you just pick one thing, like eating less meat. Just do\u00a0something.\""

      "\"Diners are disappearing from America,\" he said. \"These become centers of communities\u2026. If the center of the community disappears, maybe you lose the sense of community and then maybe you lose the country. So I'm gonna fix everything with my diner.\"",
      "His production company is called Lucky Bastards, a label that still fits as he finds new joy in simple pleasures and fresh projects at 65.",
      "But Rosenthal brushed off any suggestion of retirement.",
      "\"I could. That's not fun,\" he said. \"If you think you've got something to say or a point to make, or feel like your work is impacting on one guy or one little kid even, who wants to stop?\"",

      "Doctors are warning of a food trend inspired by the popular Netflix movie \"KPop Demon Hunters\" that is leading to serious burn injuries.",
      "The trend involves children and teens imitating a scene from the hit streaming movie by eating hot instant noodles, but doctors say it has become dangerous.",
      "Injuries are coming from both the temperature of the noodles and hot water being spilled, Dr. Colleen Ryan, a burn care specialist at Shriners Children's Boston and Harvard Medical School surgery professor, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most of the time, it's when the children open the microwave themselves. Microwave is usually up high, and they reach in and it's a little too hot for them,\" she said, adding the clinic has been seeing two to three burn cases a week from the trend.",
      "Not only is a burn painful, but they can leave a lifelong scar and cause emotional distress, Ryan said.",
      "The American Burn Association says a scalding injury for adults can occur after contact with 155 degree water for one second, but children's skin is thinner, making it easier to burn. A recent study at the University of Chicago found 31% of childhood scald admissions were caused by instant noodles.",
      "Ryan said post-burn first aid is important.",
      "\"20 minutes of cool water,\" she advised. \"Then you need to call for help.\"",
      "Ryan added she's seeing a wide range of ages among kids coming in with burns from the noodles. When it comes to these viral trends, research shows the most impressionable age range is 8 to 10.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 12:31:05 -0400",
    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday praised a plan announced by the White House earlier this week that President Trump said is designed to lower the cost of prescription drugs, calling it a \"major step\" toward making medication more affordable for Americans.",
      "On Tuesday, the president announced that drug giant Pfizer had agreed to be part of a new direct-to-consumer government purchasing platform known as TrumpRx, that, according to Pfizer, will allow \"American patients to purchase medicines from Pfizer at a significant discount.\"",
      "The president said that Pfizer had \"agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States.\"",
      "Pfizer is the first of many drug makers the president claimed has agreed to offer steep drug discounts to all Americans through TrumpRx, in line with the lowest prices paid by Europeans.",
      "\"We've seen this disparity for a long time, and we know it has not been sustainable,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News in an interview Thursday.",
      "The president also said that Pfizer had agreed to lower the cost of the prescription medications that it provides to Medicaid recipients.",
      "\"Pfizer is committing to offer all of their prescription medications to Medicaid, and it will be at the most-favored nations prices,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Makary argues the Trump administration's agreement with Pfizer will help in addressing health care costs across the board.",
      "\"By reigning in egregious drug prices, we're actually addressing the larger issue of healthcare costs in the United States, which is something no one has really be able to get a handle on until now,\" Makary said.",
      "According to Pfizer, TrumpRx will provide savings up to 85% for certain medications, such as Duavee, a drug that treats menopause symptoms.",
      "Duavee's sticker price is $203 per month, but according to Pfizer, on TrumpRx, it will cost $30 per month. Xeljanz, a Pfizer medication for arthritis, currently costs $6,000 out-of-pocket per month, but on TrumpRx, it will cost about $3,600.",
      "\"This is a major, major step, and we have to do it,\" Makary told CBS News when asked if, even with the discounts, the drugs will still be unaffordable for many Americans.",
      "The Trump administration said the TrumpRx website will launch next year, but Makarty did not have specific timing.",
      "Makary believes that patients with health insurance who are still unable to afford certain medications will still be helped by TrumpRx.",
      "\"I think it's going to help them significantly,\" Makary said. \"You're going to see a series of announcements by different pharmaceutical companies. This has been the No. 1 health priority in this administration.\"",
      "Sarah Wisniewski, a Maryland resident in her mid-40s, has been living with multiple sclerosis since 2018. Although she she says she has good insurance, it has repeatedly failed to cover the specialty medication her doctor prescribed to slow the progression of her disease. In 2024, when her physician recommended a treatment that could help, she says her insurance company denied coverage three times. She was only approved after the Maryland attorney general intervened.",
      "When CBS News asked Makarty about Wisniewski, he explained, \"I've seen that story throughout my career as a cancer surgeon, and it's tragic, and we've seen nothing on drug prices for the last 50 years.\"",
      "More than 90% of Americans have some form of health insurance, yet many still struggle to afford critical medications. Wisniewski told CBS News she is skeptical about the new TrumpRx program.",
      "\"If big pharma isn't required to put their drugs on this market, and if they're not forced to lower prices, then this feels like a toothless, symbolic statement, as opposed to having any real, long-term impact on the lives of the clinically ill,\" she said.",
      "She also questioned how the administration plans to pressure pharmaceutical companies to list the most urgently needed medications on the platform. Even at 50% to 80% cheaper, she said, some of these drugs remain unaffordable.",
      "Makary told CBS News that this is just the beginning of the solution:",
      "\"Each year, we throw good money after bad into a broken system where we pay more and more for drugs,\" Makary said. \"This is the first time we're seeing a major reset \u2014 cutting the price of some drugs, not all, but some, by 50% to 80%.\"",
      "Stacie Dusetzina, a prescription medication industry expert and a health policy professor at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says the president's plan will not lower most Americans' out-of-pocket costs for medications.  \"The reality of who can actually benefit by paying cash for these drugs through this website, it's probably going to be a smaller number of people than what is being promoted,\" Dusetzina said.",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, also previously expressed doubts to CBS News about how much the program would help Americans save.",

    "story": [
      "Planned Parenthood's two clinics in Louisiana closed on Tuesday over challenges that the organization said made it unfeasible to operate there.",
      "The clinics were in Baton Rouge and New Orleans.",
      "The president of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast said the closures were forced by \"compounding political attacks that have dismantled public health infrastructure, (and) blocked patients from care.\"",
      "The closures follow a court ruling last month that affected the clinics' ability to accept Medicaid reimbursements for providing patient care, by clearing the way for a provision of President Trump's tax and spending bill to be implemented.",
      "\"A federal court has allowed the Trump administration's 'defunding' of Planned Parenthood to take effect, blocking patients with Medicaid from accessing care in our health centers,\" the organization said in mid-September.",
      "Planned Parenthood said \u2060Texas has barred the organization from the state's Medicaid program since 2021, but that the latest ruling means Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast can no longer accept Medicaid in its Louisiana health centers.\u2060",
      "Planned Parenthood has warned of other possible closures nationwide amid Medicaid funding cuts in Mr. Trump's spending and tax bill, which instructs the government to halt Medicaid payments for a year to certain abortion providers.",
      "But while many Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortion services, the clinics in Louisiana that closed had not offered abortion services at any time in their 40-year history, according to the New Orleans Health Department. Planned Parenthood has never had a license to perform abortions in Louisiana, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Last year, the clinic in New Orleans served about 16,000 patients for sexually transmitted infection care and testing, and almost 9,000 patients for family planning care, including birth control and pregnancy tests, according to Planned Parenthood data provided by the New Orleans Health Department.",
      "\"We know that Planned Parenthood New Orleans on Claiborne Avenue served tens of thousands of patients a year with sexual and reproductive health services, and that clinic was important, because it was open access for people who were uninsured or underinsured people who didn't feel comfortable going elsewhere,\" said Jeannie Donovan, deputy director of population health and disease prevention at the New Orleans Health Department. \"It served a real need in our community.\"",
      "Donovan said her department has been working hard to fill the gap for people who relied on the New Orleans clinic for health care needs, creating new maps and databases for patients to find new primary care options.",
      "The clinics in New Orleans and Baton Rouge provided nearly 30,000 tests for sexually transmitted infections, as well 1,800 cancer screenings and 655 ultrasounds. They saw 14,400 visits for birth control, the AP reported.",
      "\"While this chapter closes, community leaders and stakeholders continue to explore possible pathways to carry forward the mission of advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights in Louisiana,\" said Melaney Linton, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, in a statement to CBS News. \"Though that future will not be possible through PPGC, the need remains urgent, and this fight is not over.\"",
      "Some, however, cheered the closures. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said on social media Tuesday, \"This is a win for babies, a win for mothers, and a win for LIFE!\"",
      "\"Planned Parenthood built its business around promoting death,\" said Attorney General Liz Murrill. \"Louisiana proudly stands for life. We will always protect women and babies here in our State.\"",
      "Planned Parenthood said in July that 200 clinics \u2014 of about 600 \u2014 across the U.S. are also at risk of closing as a result of federal policy changes and funding cuts, although the organization is trying to have its funding restored through the courts.",
      "Last week, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced it would stop scheduling abortions, and the Arizona affiliate announced it would stop providing care to people covered by Medicaid. Those changes come after five clinics in California, as well as eight in Iowa and Minnesota, closed their doors earlier this year.",

      "A company with an incrementally funded government contract may find itself in a more precarious financial position. Under such contracts, the government pays a business for the work it does as a job progresses.",
      "\"During a shutdown, the funds might not be there for a contractor, and in such situations, those contractors are looking at whether they need to stop working or keep going, and try to get the government to pay them later,\" Beezley said.",
      "Even when contractors want to continue doing their jobs, they might be impeded by practical obstacles.",
      "\"Say a person who unlocks a government facility in the morning has been furloughed and a contractor shows up Monday morning and can't get into the facility \u2014 that impacts their performance,\" Beezley said.",
      "Federal agencies have the discretion to terminate such contracts, at which point a company can decide whether or not to continue paying workers, or assign them to another job.",
      "\"Most contracting companies out of goodness of heart don't keep paying janitors,\" Koh said. \"So in effect, most of them aren't getting paid.\"",
      "Attempts at legislation",
      "In 2023, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota, introduced legislation to secure back pay for federal contract workers facing layoffs during a potential shutdown.",
      "\"Contractor employees perform jobs that are critical to the operation of our government, providing food service, security, and doing custodial work,\" Smith said in a statement at the time. \"These are often low-wage jobs that mean workers are living paycheck to paycheck. In the past, these workers haven't received back pay at the end of a government shutdown like the thousands of government employees. And it's time we right that wrong.\"",
      "The bill failed to advance.",
      "Small businesses",
      "As far as ripple effects go, businesses in places like Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland, that depend on government workers' patronage could start feeling a pinch if the shutdown drags on for more than a few weeks. Without cash in their pockets, such workers are expected to pull back on their discretionary spending, according to economists.",
      "\"If a shutdown is prolonged, there will be repercussions for businesses in certain areas with a large number of federal workers, if they aren't being paid,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics told CBS News. \"Areas that rely on the government workforce to spend at their business could be vulnerable.\"",

      "The app, which is free, relies on crowdsourcing to track ICE agents, with the company noting that it allows people to report sightings of ICE activities \"within a 5 mile radius of your current location.\" The app crossed 1 million downloads a month ago, the developer said. In its social media post, the ICEBlock developer blamed \"pressure from the Trump Admin.\" for the decision.",
      "\"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\"",

      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents.

    "summary": "The number of unemployed people looking for work more than six months has surged to its highest level since 2021.",
    "story": [
      "When Anna Whitlock was let go from her job in the technology industry in November of 2024, she wasn't worried about lining up a new position. The Washington state resident had 11 years of experience managing network infrastructure projects, a specialized role that involves equipping buildings with internet access, cameras and wifi security systems.",
      "\"The last time I had to job search, I found something pretty easily,\" she said.",
      "Almost a year later, the 37-year-old is still without a job. Whitlock said she has applied to hundreds of jobs \u2014 even for positions she's overqualified for \u2014 to no avail.",
      "\"The more I looked, the more I wasn't getting responses. If I did have an interview, I only made it the first one or two rounds,\" said Whitlock, who has a 16-year-old daughter. \"Things got really real when my unemployment ran out.\"",
      "Sidelined for months",
      "While the government's September jobs report\u00a0wasn't released on Friday\u00a0because of the government shutdown, other recent economic signals point to an increasingly challenging job market for people like Whitlock. Private employers\u00a0declined by 32,000 jobs\u00a0in September, according to payroll processing firm ADP. The number of job openings around the U.S. has also steadily dropped, economic data shows.",
      "And while the nation's unemployment rate remains historically low, at 4.3%, the share of Americans defined as long-term unemployed \u2014 or those unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26%, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "As of August, the number of long-term unemployed people had risen to 1.9 million, according to government data \u2014 the highest level since 2021, when the nation was still reeling from the pandemic.",
      "With the job market faltering in recent months as employers put the brakes on hiring, more workers are being sidelined for months on end, economists told CBS News.",
      "\"We're continuing to see this low-hire, low-fire environment,\" said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \"There aren't really new jobs being opened up for people \u2014 there isn't room for new people to come in.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Thursday captures the dimming view many Americans have of the labor market, with 33% of respondents describing it as \"good,\" down from 41% in April. What's more, 48% said they think there are fewer good jobs where they live compared to five years ago.",
      "1,000 job applications",
      "The rise in long-term unemployed Americans poses two risks, Ullrich said. Workers themselves can suffer financial setbacks as they burn through savings and take on debt to stay afloat. And the broader U.S. economy can suffer if people give up on looking for work after becoming discouraged at the prospects of finding a job.",
      "\"Folks who do go into this long-term unemployment category, it's harder for them to get back into the labor force,\" he said. \"The concern is that they become discouraged workers and they stop working, and then they fall out of the labor force entirely.\"",
      "People who have been hunting for a job for months say the process is both frustrating and demoralizing, especially after sending hundreds of applications that fail to get a response. James Strawn, 55, a software quality expert in Colorado who lost his job in July, said he's submitted 100 applications and only received one response.",
      "\"I've had people say, 'Those are rookie numbers, like that is nothing \u2014 I've submitted 1,000 applications',\" he told CBS News. \"Every morning when I get on LinkedIn \u2014 I'm on there all day now \u2014 I see another post that's like another horror story of looking for jobs.\"",
      "Strawn said he was rejected from a minimum wage job at a fitness center, and has taken on a seasonal job at UPS. But he's increasingly fearful that he may not find work in his technology field by year-end, when his severance pay runs out.",
      "Strawn also worries that ageism could be playing a role in his struggle to land a job in his field. \"It's going to take a small miracle to find something,\" he said. \"It's really tough \u2014 it's really a bad market.\"",
      "It's not only experienced workers who are struggling. Young workers and recent college graduates are also having a hard time breaking into the job market. Because there's a glut of workers looking for jobs, employers are requiring that applicants have more extensive \u00a0resumes, Ullrich told CBS News.",
      "\"They are asking for more years of experience, like nine-plus,\" she said. \"Most of it is because they can.\"",
      "The unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds is \"slowly but steadily rising,\" said Elise Gould, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"I was quickly humbled\"",
      "Matthew McMeans, who graduated from the University of Memphis last year, estimates he applied to roughly 500 jobs during an 18-month job search before landing a position as a full stack software engineer in early August. He described the job hunt as \"miserable\" and \"degrading\" given the difficulty in landing interviews.",
      "\"When I started my degree, the hopes were really high that you were going to get multiple offers when you graduated,\" the 23-year-old said. \"But as soon as I started really searching and applying, I was quickly humbled.\"",
      "The wobbly labor market has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve, which has a so-called dual mandate to keep both unemployment and inflation low. Last month, the central bank\u00a0cut interest rates for the first time since December 2024 in an effort to bolster the labor market.",
      "But even if the job market improves, for many the damage has already been done. Whitlock, the IT professional who has been unemployed for almost a year, said she's managed to get assistance through programs like SNAP, better known as food stamps, and to negotiate down her cell phone and car insurance bills.",
      "But she was also forced to liquidate her retirement fund and a small investment account to make sure she had enough to live on.",
      "Said Whitlock, \"I'm probably right now in a position where I've got maybe three months until I'm in a really bad spot.\"",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "Many Americans are eager to put money away for retirement, but that goal is increasingly out of reach because more workers are living paycheck to paycheck, a new Goldman Sachs study finds.",
      "Roughly 42% of younger working Americans \u2014 spanning Gen Z, millennials and Gen X \u2014 report having no spare savings after covering their basic living expenses, according to the analysis, which surveyed about 3,600 workers and 1,500 retirees. Among those just getting by, about three-quarters said they are struggling to save for retirement, the survey found.",
      "The share of U.S. workers in this precarious financial position has grown significantly since 1997, when 31% lived paycheck to paycheck, according to Goldman. The investment bank projects that figure could climb to well over half of Americans by 2033 as essentials like housing and health care continue to rise in cost.",
      "\"Save more\" ignores reality",
      "The findings underscore the challenges millions of Americans now face just making ends meets while also managing to set aside money for retirement, a financial pinch that Goldman Sachs calls a \"financial vortex.\" That money crunch helps explains why more than a quarter of older Americans are nearing retirement without anything saved \u2014 a gap that could widen given the financial pressures facing younger workers.",
      "\"These findings force us to ask a very critical question: Does the retirement math still work? The answer is no,\" said Greg Wilson, head of retirement at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a conference call to discuss the report. \"Telling workers just to 'save more' ignores the realities they face.\"",
      "Skipping a latte or avocado toast isn't likely to make much of a dent in the financial dynamics facing workers today, with Goldman finding that basic expenses are consuming an ever growing share of people's after-tax income.",
      "For instance, homeownership now eats up 51% of income, up from 33% in 2000, while health care costs account for 16% of after-tax earnings, up from 10% a quarter century ago, the analysis found.",
      "\"The mounting challenges American workers face ... make it harder than ever to save for retirement,\" Wilson said.",
      "Such financial pressures come as many Americans are on their own to plan, and save for, their retirement, largely because of the shift in the 1980s from company-sponsored pensions to 401(k) plans.",
      "As a savings vehicle, 401(k) shifts the burden onto workers, who must decide how much to save, how to invest and how to draw down their money in retirement \u2014 a do-it-yourself approach that retirement experts such as Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research in New York,\u00a0describe as inadequate.",
      "Hoping for a miracle",
      "Financial professionals say it's no coincidence that members of Generation X, which entered the workforce just as the shift to 401(k)s became mainstream, is feeling unprepared as they get closer to retirement. Now 45 to 60 years old, almost half said they believed it would take a \"miracle\" for them to be able to retire, a Natixis study found last year.",
      "Goldman acknowledged that it can be difficult to close a retirement funding gap with savings alone, but noted that some strategies could help. Some approaches may be out of reach for older workers, like Gen X and millennials, but could be of use for their children \u2014 for instance, setting aside $500 a year from ages 1 to 20, a move Goldman found could increase retirement savings by 14%.",
      "Adding private market investments to a portfolio could also help boost retirement savings by 14% through higher returns, according to Goldman. Those strategies might become more accessible for workers under a Trump administration plan to open up 401(k)\u00a0plans to private equity, cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments.",
      "Lastly, if possible, workers should take advantage of benefits from their employers such as funding an emergency savings account, which can help them avoid raiding their 401(k) in case of an unexpected expense, such as medical bills, the bank notes.",
      "Even so, while those approaches might work for workers with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, about half of all U.S. private-sector workers\u00a0lack access to such programs, an analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts found earlier this year. Although it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to an employer retirement plan said they struggled to build wealth, the Pew survey found.",

      "Today, the number saying the economy is getting worse has ticked up again, as prices continue to weigh on perceptions.",
      "Prices continue to be the main metric people use to evaluate the wider economy. And most say in the last few weeks, prices of the goods and services they buy have still been going up.

      "Some of that may be driven by prospective outlook. Most who are currently employed do feel at least somewhat, if not very, secure in their jobs right now. Yet most Americans think if they were looking for a job, it would be difficult to find the kind of job they want.",

By 4 to 1, Americans think there are fewer \u2014 not more \u2014 good jobs where they live than there were five years ago, and the rest see it holding steady. Even workers who feel they have some job security tend to think there are fewer, not more, good jobs out there.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 11:05:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",
      "2025 shutdown",
      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",
      "Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 cuts would begin in two days.",
      "The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats.",
      "\"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible for them, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \"Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",

      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers.

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

The layoffs this year, although elevated, remain well below the massive workforce reductions in 2020, when the pandemic shuttered businesses across the nation, leading to 2 million layoffs through September of that year, Challenger noted.",
      "The rise in layoffs comes as the labor market has stalled in recent months, with employers also sharply scaling back their hiring plans, according to labor data. Companies now expect to bring on 58% fewer workers for the rest of the year compared with their projections a year ago, the firm found.",
      "\"Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,\" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a statement.",
      "The government shutdown could lead to more job cuts, with the White House Office of Management and Budget last week\u00a0telling federal agencies\u00a0to consider layoffs during a closure.",

      "In the absence of the government's monthly jobs report, other measures of the labor market's health are drawing more attention from economists. On Wednesday, ADP said that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "However, some signs suggest that the pace of layoffs is easing, with Challenger's data showing that businesses announced roughly 54,000 job cuts in September, a 37% drop from the nearly 86,000 cuts announced in August.",

The Fed is penciling in two additional rate cuts for the remainder of 2025.",
      "A decline in borrowing costs for businesses and consumers could help bolster the job market, Challenger said. As interest rates fall, businesses have more flexibility to expand and hire more workers.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks closed at record highs Wednesday despite a U.S. government shutdown\u00a0expected to idle hundreds of thousands of workers and hobble federal agencies charged with dispensing a range of critical services. So why do investors seem unfazed?",
      "Although shutdowns have serious, real-world consequences for millions of Americans, data shows they tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, especially if the closure is brief.",
      "\"Most of the economic activity is delayed and usually gets made up shortly after a shutdown ends,\" Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told CBS News. \"So I can't imagine this will be anything terribly disruptive for the equity markets.\"",
      "Over the previous 22 shutdowns the U.S. has seen since 1976, the S&P 500 rose during some of the closures while falling at other times. Overall, the stock index gained an average of 0.3% during the episodes, according to an analysis from Carson Group (see chart).",
      "What's more, the stock index jumped 13% on average in the 12 months following the shutdowns, the asset management firm found.",
      "\"Government shutdowns are inconvenient and messy, but there is little evidence that they have a significant impact on the economy,\" said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in a report.",
      "During the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which started in December 2018 and extended into January of the following year, some 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay. That put many employees under severe financial pressure, driving some to food banks and others to launch online fundraising campaigns.",
      "Yet for the $30 trillion U.S. economy as a whole, that lost income amounted to a drop in the bucket, noted Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investment advisory firm Capital Economics. Consumption across the U.S. dipped for the two months the government remained partially shuttered, but quickly recovered.",
      "With Wall Street shrugging off the headlines on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 0.3%, topping the all-time high it set last week. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished in record territory.",
      "Why this time could be different",
      "The caveat? History is a guide \u2014 not a guarantee that events will follow the same script. The political dynamics driving the latest meltdown in Congress obviously differ from those that shaped previous eras, making it hard to predict how long the latest shutdown will last. An impasse lasting a month or more would fuel market uncertainty and could shake investor confidence, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Right now uncertainty is picking up again with new tariffs announced last week, and this just adds to it, which can paralyze growth for the foreseeable future,\" economist Daniel Altman and author of newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS News. \"It makes it harder for stocks to continue rising if nobody knows what the fiscal picture is going to be like for the next year.\"",
      "If the shutdown drags on, companies could also press pause on making investment and hiring decisions, which would weigh on stock prices, Altman said.",
      "The latest closure will have another immediate impact that could fray investor nerves \u2014 halting the flow of economic reports that experts use to assess everything from the rate of inflation to the pace of job growth.

      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-manufacturing-trump-tariffs-economy/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:09:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-fire-lisa-cook/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:08:46 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district ruled in September that President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was likely illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will hear arguments in January on whether President Trump can fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "The high court said in a brief unsigned order that it is not yet acting on Mr. Trump's request for emergency relief. The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to freeze a lower court order that found Cook's purported removal was likely illegal and allowed her to remain a Fed governor.",
      "By deferring a decision on the president's bid for emergency relief, Cook can remain in her position on the Fed's Board of Governors for now.",
      "Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee last month, which culminated with the central bank announcing its first cut to its benchmark interest rate in nine months. The panel will meet next in October and December.",
      "Her lawyers warned the Supreme Court that allowing Mr. Trump to remove Cook from the board of governors even for a brief period would have severe consequences, risking chaos and disruption of financial markets.",
      "Accepting the president's argument, Cook's lawyers said, \"would eviscerate the Federal Reserve's longstanding independence, upend financial markets, and create a blueprint for future presidents to direct monetary policy based on their political agendas and election calendars.\"",
      "But they warned it would also open the Fed up to political influence. Granting Mr. Trump the emergency relief he sought would \"sound the death knell\" for the Fed's independence\" and transform it into a body that is \"subservient to the President's will,\" Cook's lawyers wrote.",
      "Cook's attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the order \"rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in response to the Supreme Court's move that \"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook from the Fed board in August and her subsequent lawsuit arguing the removal broke the law set up a major test of his authority to oust key officials at the central bank. The president has criticized the Fed for not lowering interest rates sooner and is seeking to put his stamp on the seven-member board.",
      "The Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, an adviser to Mr. Trump, to the board of governors last month. Miran chaired the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and is taking an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board, an unusual move.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to oust Cook are unprecedented, as no president has attempted to remove a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics of the move have warned that the effort harms the Fed's independence and could destabilize markets.",
      "In announcing his decision to fire her, the president claimed Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents in 2021, before she was appointed to the board of governors, by claiming two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence in order to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" and she has not been charged with any wrongdoing. They called the allegations \"flimsy\" and \"unproven.\" Reuters reported\u00a0that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said the alleged misstatements gave him \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook from the Fed board.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a request for emergency relief to the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued: \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled last month that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her removal. The judge said the president's reason for ousting Cook rests on alleged actions before she joined the Fed board, and found the requirement that Fed governors can only be removed \"for cause\" covers only conduct while in-office.",
      "Cook joined the Fed board in 2022 and was reappointed by President Biden to a 14-year-term that is set to end in 2038.",
      "Cobb also ruled that Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before her removal.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district judge's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which voted 2-1 to decline its request to let Mr. Trump fire Cook.",
      "The two-judge majority agreed that Cook did not receive adequate process before her removal. It did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it is not challenging the constitutionality of the for-cause removal restriction for Fed governors enacted by Congress.",
      "But Cook's lawyers said there must be \"some meaningful check\" on the president's ability to remove her.",
      "\"Otherwise, any president could remove any governor based on any charge of wrongdoing, however flawed,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"That regime is not what Congress envisioned when it protected the Federal Reserve Board from presidential control. That regime is not what this Court envisioned when it went out of its way to single out the Board as a unique institution with a unique history of independence.\"",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies that Mr. Trump has moved to fire since returning to the White House. The Supreme Court has so far allowed the president to oust members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission without cause.",
      "It will hear arguments in December on the constitutionality of removal protections for FTC commissioners and whether to overturn a key 1935 decision that allowed Congress to insulate certain independent agencies from political pressure. The case tests the scope of the president's removal authority.",
      "But the high court in May suggested the Fed is different from those agencies because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

    "summary": "Monthly report shows private employers shed 32,000 jobs last month, another sign the labor market is facing new challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said on Wednesday that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs last month, signaling the labor market continued to face headwinds in September.",
      "More attention may be given to the ADP data this week because the government's monthly jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday, Oct. 3, could be delayed due to the government shutdown that began today, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues the federal monthly jobs report, noted in a statement that it has halted data releases \"due to the suspension of Federal government services.\" It added, \"The last update to the site was Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. Updates to the site will start again when the Federal government resumes operations.\"",
      "The ADP report, which is based on payroll data from more than 26 million U.S. employees, comes as the U.S. economy expanded at a stronger-than-expected rate in the second quarter. At the same time, the government's monthly jobs reports this summer have shown disappointing job growth as some businesses are holding off on hiring amid economic challenges such as tariffs and artificial intelligence.",
      "\"This is the latest data point signaling a fairly dramatic softening in labor momentum as companies aggressively dial back on hiring,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "September's ADP decline represents the largest since March 2023, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The government jobs report, issued by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is expected to show that employers hired 50,000 people last month, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. Given the government shutdown, it's unclear whether the report will be issued Friday, or, if not, how long it might be delayed.",
      "The ADP report differs from the BLS monthly jobs report in that it only tracks employment at private businesses, while the government data covers both private employers and public sector hiring at local, state and federal levels. As a result, the two reports can differ significantly, and the ADP report doesn't always foreshadow the BLS' monthly data.",
      "\"Although there is only a passing correlation between monthly changes in the ADP measure of private payrolls and the official non-farm payrolls estimates, the plunge in the former in September is a concern, particularly since the government shutdown could delay the release of the official employment data,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, sad in a report Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Reserve is scheduled to make its next interest-rate decision on Oct. 29, with most economists forecasting a cut of 0.25 percentage points, according to CME FedWatch. The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by that amount at its meeting last month, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell citing weaker labor market conditions as a reason for the move to ease borrowing costs.",
      "\"If the shutdown drags on, the weakness in the ADP will be all the Fed has to go on as it considers another rate cut at the FOMC meeting late this month,\" Brown said.",
      "Most of the weakness last month was due to small and midsize businesses shedding jobs, while large employers \u2014 those with more than 500 workers \u2014 added 33,000 employees in September, ADP said.",
      "ADP also revised its August numbers downward to show that private businesses shed 3,000 jobs, versus its earlier estimate that companies had hired 54,000 employees that month.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

      "OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT,\u00a0announced\u00a0new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program.",
      "All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.",
      "The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize the safety of ChatGPT for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",

      "According to a Saturday notice published by the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the recall covers select State Fair corn dogs and Jimmy Dean \"Pancakes & Sausage On a Stick\" and \"French Toast & Sausage On a Stick\" products from Texas-based Hillshire Brands, which is a subsidiary of Tyson Foods.",
      "The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries. The company later determined that a \"limited number\" of these products included \"extraneous pieces of wooden stick within the batter,\" Tyson said in a corresponding announcement, adding that it opted to initiate a recall \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently as Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, said the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas.",
      "FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S., as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.",
      "Consumers in possession of the recalled items are urged to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.",
      "To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use-by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of \"EST-582\" or \"P-894\" printed on the packaging.",
      "It's unclear if consumers who purchased these now-recalled products will be eligible for a refund. The FSIS says consumers with questions about the recall can contact Christina Self, The Hillshire Brands Company Associate Director of Customer Care, at 888-747-7611.",
      "Foreign object contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls in the U.S. Beyond plastic, metal fragments, bits of bugs and more \"extraneous\" materials have prompted recalls by making their way into packaged goods.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 12:44:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Newspapers announced John D. Rockefeller as the first U.S. billionaire 109 years ago. Today there are more than 900 American billionaires.",
    "story": [
      "On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire.",
      "More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth \u2014 approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel.",
      "Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today.",
      "American billionaires number over 900, according to researchers",
      "There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing.",
      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",
      "Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

But they have said that they agree with the president's framework for the release of the hostages. So what those talks should be about \u2013 and some of that conversation is already happening now - - it's not waiting until Monday in Cairo \u2013 is the logistics behind the release of these hostages.",

That's what should be \u2013 that's what this conversation should be about at this point, because they've agreed to the framework of it.",
      "Then there's second \u2013 beyond that is, what happens after that? And that is, how do we ensure that we can create a \u2013 and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas? And that's going to take work and some time, not just to agree on, but to implement.",
      "But that's important, because that's what's going to bring a permanent end to these hostilities in the long term. And so those are the two phases here. But, right now, the most emergent and immediate phase is the one that Hamas claims to have agreed to already, and that is, they are prepared to release the hostages.",
      "Let's discuss through the mediators the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens. And that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So my sources have indicated to me that, because the upper echelon of Hamas fighters has been so decimated, communication is difficult. The other terror groups who also hold hostages in Gaza aren't necessarily easily controlled by them.",
      "How do you manage around this reality? And is full release by October 7 the demand?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I don't know about the date. It would be great if it was before October 7. We wish it would have happened yesterday.",
      "But there are realities here, and then there are things people do to impede progress. Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that suffered a tremendous amount of destruction. That fighting needs to stop. You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on.",
      "But, at the same time, that can't \u2013 you know, so that has to end, but \u2013 that has to stop. But you also have to work through the other logistics. Who's going to go pick them up? We saw how this happened in the past. You know, the Red Cross would go in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They would be handed over through this process, et cetera. And so all of that's what has to be worked on and is being worked on as we speak.",
      "So I'm not telling you there aren't some logistical hurdles here, but I am saying that the expectation is, is that this happens quickly. And I would also say that, while we want all the hostages to be released, if there are five that are ready to go right now, they should be released right now. If another 10 are ready to go in 12 hours after that, the next group should come out, but, ultimately, they should all come out.",
      "And I think what you're hearing from people is, yes, there has to be some logistics that have to be worked through. But what you can't have and what we can't see and what we hope we will not see is that we get into these talks, and these talks are then delayed, and it looks like they're unnecessarily delaying it.",
      "That would be a very bad sign. Let's hope that's not what happens. And it's going to be very important for our partners in the region who signed on to this deal, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, et cetera, for them to be putting a lot of pressure on Hamas to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you pointed out that releases can't happen when bombardments are underway.",
      "Our CBS team in Gaza tells us that there are Israeli bombardments under way. There were strikes Saturday, tens killed, more injured, bombings continuing. One incident included 10 people killed when they tried to check in on their homes in areas where there are also military sites. Is that acceptable?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think, ultimately, what you're going to see here is that, when an agreement is reached on these are the logistics behind when the release is going to happen, then I think you'll see those bombardments stop.",
      "And I think some of that activity has already decreased somewhat. So, there's a framework here, and the framework is simple. Once you agree on the logistics of how this is going to happen \u2013 I think the Israelis and everyone acknowledge you can't release hostages in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop, and, as you saw, the president state that very clearly on Friday, where he want \u2013 asked the Israelis to begin to pull back to create the conditions for these releases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is not a violation of that?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, look, there's going to be a lot of complexities.",
      "Well, we're trying to get the hostages out. That's the bottom line. We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible. For that to happen, there can't be a war going on in the middle of it, and Hamas has to agree to turn them over and we have to have the right people go in and get them. That's what we're going to focus on right now, and that's what we're going to \u2013 that's what we've been focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And that's what the talks are going to be about today, on Monday, on Tuesday, to get this done as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you. There are two phases here, with \u2013 Hamas releasing the hostages is the one you're most focused on. But, big picture, does the United States assess that Israel has so reduced the threat posed by Hamas that it can end combat and transition to the kind of lower tempo counterterrorism campaign that, say, the United States carries out against terrorist threats to this country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, look, I mean, the ideal outcome here is, you don't have to carry out any counterterror missions because there are no terrorists in Gaza because Gaza is governed by Palestinian technocrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can they take the win? Can Netanyahu say he won this war?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, that \u2013 creating a Gaza \u2013 or setting up a Gaza that is governed by Palestinian technocrats that are not terrorists and are not sponsoring terrorism, that's not going to happen in 72 hours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's going to take some time to build up, and it's going to require a lot of work and a lot of international support.",
      "And that's the end goal here of this entire endeavor, after you get the hostages out. By the way, if you can't get the hostages out, you have no hope of getting that done. So that's why I say, you know, that that \u2013 these two steps need to happen.",
      "But it's going to take a lot of hard work and time. You know, you're trying to build something that doesn't exist right now, which is a sort of civilian Palestinian leadership that's not tied to terrorism. That doesn't exist right now. It's going to take a lot of help from international partners.",
      "That's why having the countries in the region and the Europeans and all others involved in this in both money and resources, that's why building that coalition is so critical. And then implementing it is not going to be easy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's going to take some time here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But I think, certainly, for the first time in a long time, you see the framework and the outlines of something that could work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But combat operations can end?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's the goal here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, you wouldn't need combat operations if there weren't terrorists there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But, by the same token, I would remind everybody, if, in fact, at the end of all this terrorism and a terrorist group remains active inside of Gaza, you're not going to have peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's the fundamental truth here that everyone needs to accept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You're never going to have peace in Gaza as long as there are terrorists operating from that territory threatening the security of Israel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But in terms of occupation and combat operations, that's different than a counterterrorism campaign.",
      "But let me ask you specifically what President Trump said. He told Barak Ravid of Axios that Prime Minister Netanyahu \u2013 quote \u2013 \"took it very far, and Israel lost a lot of support in the world. Now I'm going to get all that support back.\"",
      "At what point did President Trump decide that Netanyahu took this fight in Gaza or his operations throughout the Middle East, when did he take it too far?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think the president's \u2013 OK, the president's observation, basically, is that because of the length of this war and how it's gone \u2013 we've all seen the international narrative.",
      "We've all seen it. Whether we agree with it or not, we have seen countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and others come out and sort of signal support for \u2013 or announce support for a Palestinian state. We have seen, even in our own domestic politics, some of the attacks on Israel.",
      "We don't forget what happened on October 7.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's the other thing the president repeatedly points to, is, remember October 7.",
      "But the implic \u2013 whether we agree with it or not, we have seen the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. And I think that's the point the president is making here, is that, whether you believe it was justified or not, right or not, that we \u2013 you cannot ignore the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing.",
      "That said, if we never want to see this happen again, meaning a war like this, you can never have another October 7 or anything like it ever happen again. And that's the thing the president has reiterated and repeatedly made clear to our partners in the region, and that is, if you truly want peace and stability and a better future for the Palestinian people, then there has to be a Gaza that is not governed or controlled in any way, shape or form by Hamas or anything that looks like Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Does the United States support a Palestinian state? Because point 19 in your White House plan talks about a credible pathway to Palestinian self- determination and statehood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, we've always said \u2013 I mean, this has been a consistent position throughout \u2013 that the only way you're ever going to have anything that looks like statehood is in a negotiated deal with the Israelis. We are so far from that right now.",
      "A pathway means, yes, you're going to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Prime Minister Netanyahu opposes\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 a Palestinian state and thanked President Trump for speaking against recognition of one. That's why I'm asking you to clarify.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, we haven't recognized a Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States has not. And, right now, there's no point in doing that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the U.S. want to see one?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 because it's not even possible. That's not even a realistic thing right now, because who \u2013 who would govern that Palestinian state, Hamas?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's point 19 in your plan\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who would govern it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 I thought.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, but that's talking about a pathway long term and in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But one of the \u2013 before you can even get there, OK, that's \u2013 you know, before you can even get there, you have to have someone to turn that land \u2013 Israel's made clear they have no interest in governing Gaza, they have no interest in occupying Gaza long term and being the government of Gaza.",
      "I think Israel \u2013 I can't speak for Israel, but I think Israel would tell you they would love to turn over Gaza to a Palestinian organization that isn't terroristic. They would love to do that. But that doesn't exist right now. That has to be built, and that's going to take time.",
      "You're not going to build that in 72 hours. You're not going to build that in 72 weeks. I mean, it's going to take some time to get to that point. So that's the pathway this discusses. And I think, if you look forward into the future, where there is suddenly a Palestinian government-like organization that can govern territory, then there's a lot of possibilities.",
      "But that has to be negotiated and agreed to by Israel. In the end, it's very simple. There can be peace in Gaza. There can be Palestinian governance in Gaza, whether you call it statehood or something else, as long as it is not terrorists that are in charge of that territory.",
      "That's what Israel agreed to when they turned over Gaza in the first place, and then Hamas took over Gaza and turned it into a terrorist camp, and that's what's led us to the point that we are at today. So if we can get off that road and onto a different road, there are a lot of possibilities long term and in the future, but right now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So maybe?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 we are far from that. Right now, we \u2013 we need to get these hostages out, and we just need technocrats that are not terrorists to be able to begin the basic reconstruction of Gaza.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That interview was taped earlier today.",
      "With the camera off, Secretary Rubio clarified that President Trump still opposes Israeli annexation of the West Bank, though there is no mention of the occupied territory in the 20-point White House peace plan.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the government shutdown now in its fifth day.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson joins us from Capitol Hill.",
      "Good morning to you, Speaker. Anyone up there to negotiate with?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): There's not, Margaret.",
      "Good morning. Good to hear your voice.",
      "It's kind of quiet around here. It has been for the last several days, and it's very unfortunate, because, as we're talking, real people are being adversely affected around the country, and some in \u2013 in very substantial ways.",
      "I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government, I surely hope that they will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did send your lawmakers home to their districts, which suggests we've got probably another week ahead of us of this shutdown.",
      "You mentioned the real-world impact. Federal workers, including our military, would miss their first paychecks October 15 or 16. How long should workers plan to be without that income?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, the only person who can answer that question is your next guest. And that's Chuck Schumer, because the House did its job. The reason that House Republicans are home working in their districts, and I suspect House Democrats should be as well, is because we did that.",
      "We passed a bipartisan, very clean continuing resolution a couple of weeks back now, and sent it to the Senate. It's very important to note what was in that. It was only 24 pages in length, Margaret. It was a good faith effort to keep the government open for seven more weeks so that Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion, could work together to fund the government with the appropriations process.",
      "Chuck Schumer always voted for those in the past. In fact, he did it 13 times during the four years of the Biden administration, but now suddenly he's commanding his Democrats in the Senate not to do it. And there's one simple reason why. They need political cover from the far left corner of the base.",
      "He's afraid, Chuck Schumer individually \u2013 ask him about it \u2013 he's afraid he's going to get a challenge from the Marxist left in his party, because that's the new wave in New York. That's what this is about. Chuck Schumer is trying to show a fight against the president and Republicans, and real Americans are being harmed in the process of this political game.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, Democrats, as you know, want to have another conversation in regard to extending some tax subsidies that lower the cost of some health care that's purchased through the Obamacare market.",
      "To that point, though, you're talking about the politics of this. Our CBS polling that we released today shows neither party's stance is viewed as worth shutting down this government.",
      "The Democrats want to talk about the tax credits. You know premium pricing is already being set now, even if this doesn't expire until end of the year. Your fellow Republican Jen Kiggans said: \"Raising costs for families with little notice and potentially stripping them of access to care is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "Doesn't she have a point here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: There's a lot of points to be made on that, and we're ready to talk about, negotiate and do all of that.",
      "But they're trying to create that as a red herring here right now. Margaret, this is a funding bootstrap measure, a very simple, very conventional thing that's been done here all the time. This is the way it works now. We need a little more time on the clock to finish the appropriations process. We have plenty of time to debate that very complicated issue.",
      "It's not a simple one. There has to be reforms to that subsidy, because there's a lot of fraud, waste and abuse involved in it. There's a \u2013 there's 535 members of Congress in the House and Senate. There's a \u2013 there's probably 400 different ideas on how to fix that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: But we need a little time to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We're not saying that we won't negotiate it. We're saying, turn the lights back on in Congress, get troops paid, TSA agents and Border Patrol agents paid who are trying to protect us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: That's purely and simply what's happening here.",

      "Do you really \u2013 do worry at all that this stance could backfire, that waiting to talk about the tax credit could hurt you and could hurt your voters?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, because \u2013 no, no, because we have time to do it. Again, the funding doesn't run out until December 31. We're talking about a September 30 deadline that's now passed to keep the government open so that Republicans and Democrats can have that very debate.",
      "Chuck Schumer has shut it off because he needs a political argument right now. One hundred percent, Margaret, that's what this is about.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: They're making this up. That is a red herring. They're trying to \u2013 they're trying to say that this fight right now is about that. That wasn't even a fight. It's a joke. Call him on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the director of the Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, was on another network this morning, and said it is up to the president of the United States to decide when the mass layoffs will begin.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: I don't know. I anticipate it will have to be soon, because Chuck Schumer turned off the funding sources and whomever is the chair of the Office\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want that as leverage?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, nor \u2013 neither does the president. No, the president wants the government open. He's pleaded with Schumer and Hakeem in person in his office to do that, and they said no, because they want to do this.",

      "Good morning to you, Leader.",
      "I want to pick up on something the speaker of the House was pointing to. He wants this fight to be about illegals, as he said. And I want to be specific here because we know from our research that there is no federal money that goes towards health care tax credits for undocumented immigrants in this country. The federal government doesn't fund health insurance for the undocumented. But it is also true that states, like yours, New York, does provide health care for people who are in this country illegally. And their argument seems to be the money here is fundable and bottom line is it comes out of the federal pocket. Do you want to respond to that?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): You know, they don't want to \u2013 Johnson doesn't want to discuss the real issue, the health care crisis facing the American people, so he puts up all these fake lies to try and divert attention. It's his standard operation. He's just is concerned with the politics.",
      "Every independent agency that looks at this says Johnson's claim is false. And just as you said, Margaret, no, zero federal dollars can go to undocumented immigrants through Medicare, Medicaid, through ACA. And so, we ought to be talking about the real issue here, which is that we have a health care crisis in America, caused by the Republicans. They've \u2013 they've barreled us towards a shutdown because they don't want to deal with that crisis, plain and simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about the shutdown in a moment. In terms of health care, where you \u2013 you've taken us in terms of the messaging, Democrats, as I understand it, are looking for an extension of those Obamacare tax credit. I believe you'd like them permanently. You heard the speaker say, we can talk about that after the government is reopened, perhaps not permanently. But do you hear any kind of opening here for a negotiation whatsoever?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, right now, not. Look, Johnson's not serious about this. He sent his \u2013 all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How you going to negotiate when they're all there.",

If you're going to negotiate any agreement, you need Johnson, Thune, Trump, Schumer, and Jeffries. And the reason he sent them home is because he's more interested in protecting the Epstein files than protecting the American people from the health care crisis.",
      "We've been trying for months and months to sit down with him and have a serious conversation addressing America's health care needs. And they've refused and refused and refused. And just on your show, and on other shows, when they ask him, well, will you do it in January.",

And it doesn't \u2013 and, by the way, the crisis doesn't start in January. Two days ago, starting October 1st, millions of Americans are getting notices that their health care premiums are going \u2013 dramatically increasing. If you're a 55-year-old couple and you pay \u2013 make $80,000, you know how much your premiums will go up if we don't extend it? It will go up something like $25,000. The average American will pay $900 more.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, do you trust Leader Thune? And \u2013 and when you look at just your numbers here, three senators already crossed over to vote with Republicans on this short-term funding deal. Are you concerned about more defections?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Look, it's a Republican shutdown because they have refused to talk with us. Johnson, I saw him mentioned that we did it 13 times when I was majority leader. That's true. You know why? In every case we sat down and talked with the Republicans, and there was a give and take, and then both sides didn't get everything they wanted, but we got it done. They have refused to talk to us even once. And Jeffries and I have been trying to get them to talk to us for \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Thune \u2013 Thune told Fox that there are ongoing \u2013",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: They've tried to get to \u2013 us to talk to them for \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ongoing conversations.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: We've tried to talk to them for months and months and months and they said, no. The American people know that they're in charge. Republican president, Republican Senate, Republican House, that they have a responsibility to governor, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But back to the question of defections. Leader Thune was on another network, on Fox, and he said there are conversations with Democrats who want to find an offramp here. Is he having conversations with Democrats other than you? Are you sure you can't \u2013 will you have defections?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: I've \u2013 I've encouraged my \u2013 yes, Margaret, I've encouraged my Democratic members to sit and talk to Republicans. It's always good when Democrats and Republicans talk to each other.",
      "But two points. First, in those conversations, the Republicans offered nothing. And \u2013 but second, the only way this will ultimately be solved is if five people sit together in a room and solve it. They are the president, who also doesn't seem serious about this. You know, he's putting out his memes and his things with the grim reaper and all of that stuff, and he's playing golf.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Johnson's not serious. And so, we've got to sit down, the five of us. That's the way to solve this problem. But when Democrats talk to Republicans, it's a good thing. And I've encouraged my Democrats to do it, but they've offered us nothing. No change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you tried calling President Trump? He seems to take phone calls directly.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, you know, we sat \u2013 we tried to get President Trump to sit down with us weeks ago, long before the shutdown date started.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no. OK.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: He said \u2013 he said, yes. He said, no. Johnson told him to say no. We sat down the \u2013 you know, the day before, and he wasn't serious. He put these red hats on the table, and he's joking around. And honestly, in the meeting, Margaret, I got the feeling he didn't even know what was happening, that the crisis was impending, that people would pay such a \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: He once said, they're going to pay all that? That would be bad for me.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: The American people are hearing what's happening, and they are demanding that we address this crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: They are demanding we sit down together and do it. It's just logical. They are \u2013 say that, you know, in your survey that you put out \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: They say that 75 percent of people feel Trump isn't doing enough. Another survey by \"The Washington Post\" showed not only did 80 percent of the American people want us to extend these credits, but 55 percent of Trump voters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, our \u2013 our \u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I have to ask you about what the president announced yesterday in regard to federalizing 300 National Guardsmen out in the state of Illinois. We've heard this threat going back all the way to August. The governor says these are not needed. Do you have any idea when they'll arrive?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I believe they're going to be Illinois national guardsmen, so they're not going to be coming from out of state. I spoke to our governor yesterday, and it looks like it's going to be about 300 Illinois guardsmen who will be activated against the governor's wishes. So, they'll be \u2013 they'll be homegrown Illinoisans. And they're our brothers and sisters, our neighbors. I probably served with quite a number of them, certainly the leadership, and, you know, they'll be home. We'll \u2013 we'll welcome them.",
      "It's a misuse of the National Guard. They're \u2013 they're not needed in this particular role. If President Trump really wanted to fight crime, then maybe he should stop defunding the police. He, you know, he diverted $800 million in crime prevention efforts away from \u2013 that was appropriated away from funding for our police officers. So, you know, I \u2013 I \u2013 they're not needed, but we're going to welcome them because they're our brothers and sisters, and we're proud of our National Guard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He has surged \u2013 or the federal government has surged agents from different groups. The FBI said yesterday they're sending folks in. Tell me about these protests. Because the \u2013 the images look pretty intense of what has happened in \u2013 between people on the streets of Chicago \u2013 we're showing some of that video now \u2013 around immigration issues. As I understand, yesterday, ICE authorities shot a Chicago woman in the Brighton Park area. Secretary Noem claimed ICE fired defensive shots at this woman, who was armed who had appeared in a border patrol intelligence bulletin previously. She claims that federal agents were surrounded and were threatened. What are local authorities telling you about what they think happened here?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, they lie, right? The Trump administration lies. We have a president who's a known liar. And they have been \u2013 they have been lying about the situation all along. And, in fact, they even shot tear grenades \u2013 tear gas grenades, I think, at a reporter who was simply driving by with her window open. And so, we are \u2013 we're urging people, we're urging our protesters, remain calm, peaceful protests, exercise your First Amendment rights, but videotape everything. Everybody has a phone. Tape everything so that we actually have real evidence of what is happening.",
      "We know the Trump administration lies consistently. And what I am hearing is that, for the large part, people are being very quite \u2013 are being very respectful, but ICE is being very aggressive. Remember that they are zip- tieing children. They are raiding apartment blocks in the middle of the night, separating children from their families, pulling people out on to the streets naked. They are using Gestapo tactics in Chicago. And this is what Trump wants to, right? He wants to intimidate the people of Chicago. That's not going to happen. And we're going to document everything and make sure, just as the judge in Portland said that these \u2013 these requirements, these orders from the Trump administration are not actually tied to reality.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about President Trump's directive to send Oregon National Guard troops into Portland, and the judge said that \u2013 untethered to the facts.",
      "But in this case, I mean the Homeland Security adviser says, \"there's a large and growing movement of left wing terrorism organized and funded.\" They're posting on Homeland Security images of snipers. So, we're not talking troops, we're talking about federal agents that are carrying out some of this right now. Have you seen any evidence of \u2013 of what Stephen Miller is describing here in terms of organization and targeting of federal agents?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: No, not at all. This is \u2013 it's simply not happening. They are lying. And so, if anybody is targeting anyone, it is out of control ICE agents targeting, again, zip-tieing children, throwing reporters onto the ground, separating children from their mothers, trying to convince schools to turn over kids from public schools. They are raging through the streets of Chicago trying to intimidate everyday, ordinary citizens who are just trying to go to school and go to work. That's not \u2013 that's not what America is about. And it is shameful that the president of the United States has instigated this in one of its greatest cities. He should be defending the city. He should be protecting the city. Send us the federal dollars that were appropriated in a bipartisan way to support law enforcement. They took money away from law enforcement officers, child prevention effort \u2013 violence against children prevention efforts. They \u2013 they've literally \u2013 this president has defunded the police.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is counter, their message at least. But on the message around the military, I want to ask you about what happened at Quantico and just \u2013 so our viewers are clear, you serve on Armed Services, but you retired from the National Guard. You were a lieutenant colonel.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Twenty-three years. Proud of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Black Hawk helicopter pilot in Iraq. You served in combat. Secretary Hegseth told senior military leaders just a few days ago, he doesn't want to prevent women from serving, but he's now going to require everyone meet the male standard.",
      "Let's listen to that.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, SECRETARY OF WAR: When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral. If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How did you hear those remarks? And how do you think female service people heard them?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, this is the least qualified secretary of defense in our nation's history. And he's questioning the ability of the women who actually qualified to do their \u2013 to do their jobs. The female rangers, the female that graduated from SEAL school have met those highest standards. And by the way, he \u2013 he is obfuscating a little bit because there are different male standards. The standard for a 45-year-old man is not the same as an 18-year-old man. So, he doesn't actually talk about that. He has long sought to push women out of the military. And, frankly, our military could not do its job of protecting America and keeping us safe without the women who serve in the military.",
      "If you look at some lessons we learned in Afghanistan, for example, the lionesses, the Marine Corps group of women who actually went on patrol, all female units, that actually was able to get intelligence from women, Afghani women, to get information on the enemy. Frankly, you've got the least qualified secretary of defense in the nation's history who wastes taxpayer dollars on a regular basis doing things like bringing in general and flag officers to be an audience for his dog and pony show, using them as little toy soldiers, when they should be out there, at their units, in command, doing their jobs.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick \u2013 pick up where we left off with Senator Duckworth, who is a Purple Heart recipient for her time serving this country in combat.",
      "Men and women have different basic fitness standards. The secretary, in his remarks at Quantico, said women \u2013 or he suggested women were being given a pass or were held to lower standards for fitness requirements. Do you think his change to the, quote/unquote, \"male standard\" is necessary?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: I think this is completely unnecessary. I have 38 years in the Army, and we've served with women in all sorts of different environments and deployments. And I never had a case where a female soldier was not able to do what she had to do. So, this is a \u2013 seems to me an unnecessary, almost a medieval approach that doesn't reflect the requirements that we have for women and men who are intelligent, able to operate in a modern battlefield environment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The defense secretary made these remarks at Quantico last week, as you well know, ordered in our most senior military officers to hear him lay out what he talked about in terms of changing rules of engagement. Those, you know, codes of conduct and standards, to make war less brutal. The secretary said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, SECRETARY OF WAR: We also don't fight with stupid rules of engagement. We untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt, and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for war fighters.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of \u2013 of those directives to officers?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, that's \u2013 that's not going to help anybody accomplish their mission. I mean when you think about the mission that we had in Afghanistan, for example, and I think that's where some of his experience comes from, it was to protect Afghan civilians so that they could reestablish government and secure themselves. And so it was not about how many Taliban could you kill. We had already tried that, and that didn't work.",
      "So, the rules of engagement are not politically correct. They're not intended to make it harder for soldiers or units to do their job. They actually are part of the mission. Why are we there? And so, I don't have any experience where killing a lot of innocent people, or violating the Geneva Convention, is going to help accomplish the mission.",
      "I think that the idea that we should \u2013 that somehow it's going to make us better and more effective by people not having to worry about the law is going to be bad for us in the long-term as well, both psychologically for soldiers, but also the trust of the American people and of our allies in American forces, where we have always lived up to international law. And that was where a lot of the respect came from. We do not want to be like the Russian army, and they certainly don't worry about rules of engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Geneva Conventions are something that the secretary, as a private citizen, wrote about in his book and questioned whether they should be followed at all. He said, \"what if we treated the enemy the way they treated us? And if we\" \u2013 I mean he talked about al Qaeda and using some of their tactics, \"rip their arms off, feed them to the hogs.\" I mean, this sounds tough, but in terms of practice, does it risk the lives of \u2013 of those who are the trigger pullers, those who are on the ground, to have this message delivered from the highest levels?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, listen, first of all, the Geneva Conventions were constructed starting in 1949 after the Second World War. And they were intended to protect innocent people, helpless people, noncombatants from the ravages of war, as it did happen in the Second World War. And I don't think anybody would say that Dwight Eisenhower was woke. And here he was, he was chief of staff of the Army, and then supreme allied commander, and then president. So, this was during his time that the United States helped create and sign the Geneva Convention. So, here's a guy with more combat experience and wartime experience than almost anybody.",
      "Now, the \u2013 when you think about modern warfare, especially when you're counterterrorism, just as Secretary Rubio was describing earlier on your program, the people \u2013 how \u2013 how you deal with the enemy and how you deal with populations is how you defeat an insurgency. And killing everybody in sight is not how you defeat an insurgency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As defense secretary, Hegseth fired the top military lawyers who advise on lethality. Here's some of the advice he gave to senior leaders this week.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: You kill people and break things for a living.",
      "In this profession, you feel comfortable inside the violence so that our citizens can live peacefully. Lethality is our calling card and victory our only acceptable end state.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think that means?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, first of all, it's not connected to the reality of how these things happen, how wars are won. First of all, the political leadership has to describe the end state. What is \u2013 what is it we're going to do? Why are we sending troops somewhere? What are they supposed to accomplish? And usually it's not going to be by killing everybody in sight. So, I think \u2013 I think there's a disconnect between this idea that it's all about lethality and that we kill people and break things. That's \u2013 that's not the mantra of any Army unit I was ever in, in 38 years. It was always about, accomplish the mission that was assigned to us, carry out every lawful order, and do it in such a way that protects civilians and ensures that all of our soldiers are protected and come back home safe. This idea of break things and kill people, you know, that's what the Russians did in Bucha and Mariupol. That's not who we are. We're the soldiers of a free, democratic country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president also spoke at that gathering. He referred to \"the enemy within.\" He also spoke about using \"U.S. cities, like Chicago, as training grounds.\" Are \u2013 are you comfortable with people thinking that?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, look, I think, first of all, U.S. military \u2013 our fellow citizens should be confident that the U.S. military will always carry out lawful orders. And so it's alarming when all of the Judge Advocate General, or the Army \u2013 or the military lawyers are sacked, are sent away because commanders do need to have legal counsel as they receive orders and they look at these complex situations. But our \u2013 our troops will carry out lawful orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: I guarantee you that no soldier wants to have to use force against American people.",

      "\"Let's discuss through the mediators the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens, and that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "On Friday, Hamas agreed to parts of the White House peace proposal, including the release of all the Israeli hostages, of which 20 are thought to be living, in exchange for 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazan detainees including women and children Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he has sent a delegation to Egypt \"to finalize technical details,\" outlining a goal to limit the negotiations to \"a time frame of a few days.\"",

Rubio outlined that he expects when an agreement is reached on the logistics of the hostage release, the bombardments will stop, adding that \"some of that activity has already decreased somewhat.\"",
      "\"We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible. For that to happen, there can't be a war going on in the middle of it,\" Rubio said. \"And Hamas has to agree to turn them over. We have to have the right people go in and get them. That's what we're going to focus on right now.\"",
      "The secretary of state said \"it's going to be very important for our partners and region who signed on to this deal,\" urging the leaders of countries including the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt to put \"a lot of pressure on Hamas to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Since Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people and 251 were taken hostage, Israel and Hamas have been at war, as Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed. Israeli authorities say around 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Beyond the hostage agreement, Hamas suggested Friday that other portions of the deal should be subject to negotiation, while Mr. Trump said he believes the group is \"ready for a lasting PEACE.\"",
      "Rubio said setting up a civilian Palestinian leadership that \"are not terrorists and aren't sponsoring terrorism \u2014 that's not going to happen in 72 hours.\"",
      "\"It's going to require a lot of work and a lot of international support, and that's the end goal here of this entire endeavor after you get the hostages out,\" he said.",
      "Still, Rubio insisted that \"for the first time in a long time, you see the framework and the output lines of something that could work.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Congressional leaders traded blame for the government shutdown on Sunday as the stalemate over how to reopen the government stretched into another week without progress on negotiations.",
      "The Senate is set to reconvene Monday after dueling measures to fund the government fell short of the necessary support for a fourth time on Friday, showing no sign of movement from either party. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson canceled plans for the lower chamber return to Washington this week in an effort to increase pressure on the Senate.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"the House did its job\" by passing a measure last month that would fund the government until Nov. 21, saying the reason House Republicans will remain in their districts this week is \"because we did that.\"",
      "\"I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government. I surely hope that they will,\" Johnson said.",
      "The House-passed measure first failed in the Senate on Sept. 19, with all but one Democrat opposing in favor of a separate measure to fund the government through October that also includes Democrats' health care priorities. Then, as the government was hours from shutting down last week, the Senate voted again on the measure, when two more senators crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans in favor. But support for the bill still remained shy of the 60-votes required in the Senate.",
      "Since then, Senate Republicans have been seeking to peel off Democratic support for their measure, while Democratic leaders have remained firm in their demand that a funding measure include an extension of health insurance tax credits. And in subsequent votes on Wednesday and Friday, Republicans were unable to pick up more support from Democrats on their bill.",
      "Johnson said Republicans are ready to negotiate on the health insurance tax credits, but he said it's a complicated issue that will take time to address, pointing to possible reforms aimed at weeding out \"a lot of fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "\"We're not saying that we won't negotiate it,\" Johnson said. \"We're saying turn the lights back on in Congress.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" argued that Johnson is \"not serious\" about negotiating the health care issue, pointing to his move to keep the House away from Washington this week. And the New York Democrat urged that the only way the funding impasse will be resolved is with a meeting between congressional leaders and the president.",
      "\"We've been trying for months and months to sit down with them and have a serious conversation addressing America's healthcare needs, and they've refused and refused and refused,\" Schumer said.",
      "Schumer and Johnson, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, met with President Trump last week. But the meeting failed to produce an agreement to avert a shutdown ahead of the deadline. Schumer said Sunday that Mr. Trump \"wasn't serious\" in the meeting, after which the president posted what appeared to be an AI-generated video mocking the Democratic leaders.",
      "\"The American people know that they're in charge \u2014 Republican president, Republican Senate, Republican House \u2014 that they have a responsibility to govern, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs,\" Schumer said.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, Marco Rubio. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It would be extraordinary to end what has been one of Israel's longest and bloodiest wars. The prime minister said he's only allowing these talks that will be underway in Egypt to go for a few days. What exactly is the deadline for Hamas and the terror groups who are holding hostages? When do they need to release them?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, yeah, so a couple points. Hamas has- obviously, look, we're dealing with Hamas. Okay. So let's take that with- for what it is. But they have said that they agree with the President's framework for the release of the hostages. So what those talks should be about, and some of that conversation is already happening now, it's not waiting until Monday in Cairo, is the logistics behind the release of these hostages. How do you stop the fighting? Who's going to go in and get them? You know, when are they going to be released? Where are they picked up? What are the processes for this? That's what should be- that's what this conversation should be about at this point, because they've agreed to the framework of it. Then there's second- beyond that is what happens after that. And that is, how do we ensure that we can create and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas and that's going to take work and some time, not just to agree on but to implement. But that's important, because that's what's going to bring a permanent end to these hostilities in the long term. And so those are the two phases here. But right now, the most emergent and immediate phase is the one that Hamas claims to have agreed to already, and that is they are prepared to release the hostages. Let's discuss, through the mediators, the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens. And that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So my sources have indicated to me that because the upper echelon of Hamas fighters has been so decimated, communication is difficult. The other terror groups who also hold hostages in Gaza aren't necessarily easily controlled by them. How do you manage around this reality and is full release by October 7 the demand?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I don't know about the date. I'd be great if it was before October 7. We wish it would happen yesterday. But there are realities here, and then there are things people do to impede progress. Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that suffered a tremendous amount of destruction that fighting needs to stop. You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on, but at the same time that can't, you know- so that has to end, but that has to stop, but you also have to work through the other logistics. Who's going to go pick them up? We saw how this happened in the past. You know, the Red Cross would go in, they would be handed over through this process, et cetera. And so all of that's what has to be worked on, and is being worked on as we speak. So I'm not telling you there aren't some logistical hurdles here, but I am saying that the expectation is that this happens quickly. And I would also say that while we want all the hostages to be released, if there are five that are ready to go right now, they should be released right now. If another 10 are ready to go in 12 hours after that, the next group should come out, but ultimately they should all come out. And I think what you're hearing from people is, yes, there has to be some logistics that have to be worked through. But what you can't have, and what we can't see, and what we hope we will not see, is that we get into these talks, and these talks are then delayed, and it looks like they're unnecessarily delaying it. That would be a very bad sign. Let's hope that's not what happens. And it's going to be very important for our partners in the region who signed on to this deal, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, etc, for them to be putting a lot of pressure on Hamas to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0But you pointed out that releases can't happen when bombardments are underway. Our CBS team in Gaza tells us that there are Israeli bombardments underway. There were strikes Saturday. Tens killed, more injured, bombings continuing. One incident included 10 people killed when they tried to check in on their homes in areas where there are also military sites. Is that acceptable?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think, ultimately, what you're going to see here is that when an agreement is reached on these logistics behind when the release is going to happen, then I think you'll see those bombardments stop, and I think some of that activity has already decreased somewhat. So, there's a framework here, and the framework is simple. Once you agree on the logistics of how this is going to happen, I think the Israelis and everyone acknowledge you can't release hostages in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop. And, as you saw, the president state that very clearly on Friday, where he asked the Israelis to begin to pull back to create the conditions for these releases--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not a violation of that?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, we're trying to get the hostages out. That's the bottom line. We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible. For that to happen, there can't be a war going on in the middle of it, and Hamas has to agree to turn them over. We have to have the right people go in and get them. That's what we're going to focus on right now, and that's what we're going to- that's what we've been focused on, and that's what the talks are going to be about today, on Monday, on Tuesday, to get this done as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you, there are two phases here. The Hamas releasing the hostages is the one you're most focused on. But, big picture, does the United States assess that Israel has so reduced the threat posed by Hamas that it can end combat and transition to the kind of lower-tempo counter-terrorism campaign that, say, the United States carries out against terrorist threats to this country?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, look, I mean, the ideal outcome here is you don't have to carry out any counter-terror missions because there are no terrorists in Gaza--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can they take the win? Can Netanyahu say he won this war?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: \u00a0Well, first of all, creating a Gaza, or setting up a Gaza that is governed by Palestinian technocrats that are not terrorists and are not sponsoring terrorism, that's not going to happen in 72 hours. That's going to take some time to build up, and it's going to require a lot of work and a lot of international support, and that's the end goal here of this entire endeavor, after you get the hostages out. By the way, if you can't get the hostages out, you have no hope of getting that done. So that's why I say, you know that these two steps need to happen. But it's going to take a lot of hard work and time. You know, you're trying to build something that doesn't exist right now, which is a sort of civilian, Palestinian leadership that's not tied to terrorism. That doesn't exist right now. It's going to take a lot of help from international partners. That's why having the countries in the region and the Europeans and all others involved in this in both money and resources, that's why building that coalition is so critical, and then implementing it is not going to be easy. It's going to take some time here, but I think, certainly, for the first time in a long time, you see the framework and the outlines of something that could work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But combat operations can end?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, that's the goal here. Well, you wouldn't need combat operations if there weren't terrorists there. But, by the same token, I would remind everybody, if, in fact, at the end of all this terrorism and a terrorist group remains active inside of Gaza, you're not going to have peace. That's the fundamental truth here that everyone needs to accept. You're never going to have peace in Gaza as long as there are terrorists operating from that territory, threatening the security of Israel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of occupation and combat operations, that's different than a counterterrorism campaign. But, let me ask you specifically what President Trump said. He told Barak Ravid of Axios that Prime Minister Netanyahu, quote, \"took it very far and Israel lost a lot of support in the world. Now I'm going to get all that support back.\" At what point did President Trump decide that Netanyahu took this fight in Gaza, or his operations throughout the Middle East- When did he take it too far?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I think the President's- the president's observation, basically, is that because of the length of this war and how it's gone- we've all seen the international narrative. We've all seen it, whether we agree with it or not. We have seen countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and others come out and sort of signal support, or announce support for a Palestinian state. We have seen, even in our own domestic politics, some of the attacks on Israel. We don't forget what happened on October 7. That's the other thing the President repeatedly points to is, remember October 7. But the impli- whether we agree with it or not, we have seen the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. And I think that's the point the President is making here, is that whether you believe it was justified or not, right or not, that we- you cannot ignore the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. That said, if we never want to see this happen again, meaning a war like this, you can never have another October 7 or anything like it ever happen again. And that's the thing the President has reiterated and repeatedly made clear to our partners in the region, and that is, if you truly want peace and stability and a better future for the Palestinian people, then there has to be a Gaza that is not governed or controlled in any way, shape or form by Hamas, or anything that looks like Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Does the United States support a Palestinian state? Because point 19 in your White House plan talks about \"a credible pathway to Palestinian self determination and statehood.\"",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, again, we've always said, I mean, this has been a consistent position throughout, that the only way you're ever going to have anything that looks like statehood is in a negotiated deal with the Israelis. We are so far from that right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0Right, but Prime Minister Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state and thanked President Trump for speaking against recognition of one. That's why I'm asking you to clarify.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, we haven't recognized the Palestinian state--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --the United States has not. And right now, there's no point in doing that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the US want to see one?",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --because it's not even possible. That's not even a realistic thing right now. Because who, who would govern that Palestinian state, Hamas?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's point 19 in your plan--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Who would govern it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I thought.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, but that's talking about a pathway long term and in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: But one of the- before you can even get there, okay, that's, you know, before you can even get there, you have to have someone to turn that land- Israel's made clear they have no interest in governing Gaza. They have no interest in occupying Gaza long term and being the government of Gaza. I think Israel, I can't speak for Israel, but I think Israel would tell you they would love to turn over Gaza to a Palestinian organization that isn't terrorists. They would love to do that. But that doesn't exist right now. That has to be built, and that's going to take time. You're not going to build that in 72 hours. You're not going to build that in 72 weeks. I mean, it's going to take some time to get to that point. So that's the pathway this discusses. And I think if you look forward into the future where there is suddenly a Palestinian government-like organization, that can govern territory, then there's a lot of possibilities. But that has to be negotiated and agreed to by Israel. In the end, it's very simple. There can be peace in Gaza, there can be Palestinian governance in Gaza, whether you call it statehood or something else, as long as it is not terrorists that are in charge of that territory. That's what Israel agreed to when they turned over Gaza in the first place, and then Hamas took over Gaza and turned it into a terrorist camp, and that's what's led us to the point that we are at today. So we can get off that road and onto a different road. There are a lot of possibilities long term and in the future, but right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So maybe?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --we are far from that. Right now, we need to get these hostages out, and we just need technocrats that are not terrorists to be able to begin the basic reconstruction of Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That interview was taped earlier today, with the camera off, Secretary Rubio clarified that President Trump still opposes Israeli annexation of the West Bank though there is no mention of the Occupied Territory in the 20 point White House peace plan."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Chuck Schumer that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. Senator Chuck Schumer is the top Democrat on the other side of the Capitol and he joins us now from New York City. Good morning to you, leader. I want to pick up on something the Speaker of the House was pointing to. He wants this fight to be about illegals, as he said. And I want to be specific here, because we know from our research that there is no federal money that goes towards health care tax credits for undocumented immigrants in this country. The federal government doesn't fund health insurance for the undocumented. But it is also true that states like yours, New York, does provide health care for people who are in this country illegally. And their argument seems to be the money here is fungible, and bottom line is, it comes out of the federal pocket. Do you want to respond to that?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: You know, they don't want to, Johnson doesn't want to discuss the real issue, the health care crisis facing the American people. So he puts up all these fake lies to try and divert attention. It's his standard operation. He just is concerned with the politics. Every independent agency that looks at this says Johnson's claim is false. And just as you said, Margaret, no, zero federal dollars can go to undocumented immigrants through Medicare, through Medicaid, through ACA. And so we ought to be talking about the real issue here, which is that we have a health care crisis in America caused by the Republicans. They've caught, they barreled us towards a shutdown because they don't want to deal with that crisis. Plain and simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about the shutdown in a moment. In terms of health care, where you've taken us, in terms of the messaging, Democrats, as I understand it, are looking for an extension of those Obamacare tax credit. I believe you'd like them permanently. You heard the speaker say we can talk about that after the government is reopened, perhaps not permanently. But do you hear any kind of opening here for a negotiation whatsoever?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Well, right now, not. Look, Johnson's not serious about this. He sent his, all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How are you going to negotiate? --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well he says the job is in the Senate. With you and leader Thune --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And he's, well, no you need, no, you actually need Johnson if you're going to negotiate any agreement. You need Johnson, Thune, Trump, Schumer and Jeffries. And the reason he sent them home is because he's more interested in protecting the Epstein files than protecting the American people from the health care crisis. We've been trying for months and months to sit down with them and have a serious conversation addressing America's health care needs. And they've refused and refused and refused. And just on your show and on other shows, when they asked him, well, will you do it in January. He says, it's starting in January. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He says, no, we'll have a conversation. Well, you know what, later means never. And we've tried 45 days and 45 days and 45 days from March on. We asked them to vote on it three times. The Republicans in the Senate, they voted no three times. So we need to solve this crisis. Look --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That was a permanent extension. The bill that I think you're referring to is Senator Shaheen. It was a permanent extension. It wasn't the, you know --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He, Johnson has not committed --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Compromise that some Republicans have proposed. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Yeah. Margaret, Johnson has not committed to any extension and he won't until the American people force him to. And it doesn't, and by the way, the crisis doesn't start in January. Two days ago, starting October 1, millions of Americans are getting notices that their health care premiums are dramatically increasing. If you're a 55 year old couple, and you pay, make $80,000, you know how much your premiums will go up if we don't extend it? It will go up something like $25,000. The average American will pay $900 more. How do Americans who are struggling, sitting at the table Friday night figuring out how to pay the bills, how the heck can they get such an increase? Democrats are simple. We want to extend it and so they won't have to pay that increase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And Johnson does not want to do it. He's just not serious about it, as exemplified by him sending the House home for two weeks. You need to be here to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, you're using word extend versus making permanent, just making clear there. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Look. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And then the number we see is the average increase of about $1,000 in premium payments for most households that will go into effect.",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Right, right. Yeah and it's horrible. And, it's horrible. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- On the reopening everything conversation, sir, though. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Yes. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --\u00a0 I mean, do you trust leader Thune? And when you look at just your numbers here, three senators already crossed over to vote with Republicans on the short-term funding deal. Are you concerned about more defections?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Look, it's a Republican shutdown because they've refused to talk with us. Johnson, I saw him mentioned that we did it 13 times when I was majority leader. That's true. You know why? In every case, we sat down and talked with the Republicans and there was a give and take, and then both sides didn't get everything they wanted, but we got it done. They have refused to talk to us even once. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well, Thune, Thune told Fox that there were ongoing, ongoing conversations. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And Jeffries and I have been trying to get them to talk to us, for, they tried to get us to talk to them for, we've tried to talk to them for months and months and months. And they said no. The American people know that they're in charge. Republican President, Republican Senate, Republican House. That they have a responsibility to govern, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But back to the question of defections. Leader Thune was on another network, on Fox, and he said that there are conversations with Democrats who want to find an off ramp here. Is he having conversations with Democrats other than you? Are you sure you can't, will you have defections?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Yeah. Margaret. I've encouraged my Democratic members to sit and talk to Republicans. It's always good when Democrats and Republicans talk to each other, but two points. First, in those conversations, the Republicans offered nothing. And, but second, the only way this will ultimately be solved is if five people sit together in a room and solve it. And they are the president, who also doesn't seem serious about this. You know he's putting out his memes and his things with the grim reaper and all of that stuff. He's playing golf. Johnson's not serious, and so we've got to sit down, the five of us. That's the way to solve this problem. But when Democrats talk to Republicans, it's a good thing. And I've encouraged my Democrats to do it, but they've offered us nothing. No change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you tried calling President Trump? He seems to take phone calls. Directly. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Well you know, we sat, we tried to get President Trump to sit down with us weeks ago, long before the shutdown day started. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So no. Okay. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He said, he said yes. He said, no. Johnson told him to say no. We sat down, you know, the day before, and he wasn't serious. He put these red hats on the table, and he's joking around. And honestly, in the meeting, Margaret, I got the feeling he didn't even know what was happening. That the crisis was impending. That people would pay such a --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He once said they're going to pay all that. That would be bad for me. And so the court here is the American people. The American people are hearing what's happening, and they are demanding that we address this crisis. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- They are demanding we sit down together and do it. It's just logical. They are, say that, you know, in your survey that you put out --",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the government shutdown now in its fifth day. House. Speaker Mike Johnson joins us from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you, Speaker. Anyone up there to negotiate with?",
      "SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: There's not, Margaret. Good morning. Good to hear your voice. It's kind of quiet around here. It has been for the last several days, and it's very unfortunate, because, as we're talking real people are being adversely affected around the country in some and in very substantial ways. I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government, I surely hope that they will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did send your lawmakers home to their districts, which suggests we've got probably another week ahead of us of this shutdown. You mentioned the real world impact federal workers, including our military, would miss their first paychecks October 15th or 16th. How long should workers plan to be without that income?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, the only person who can answer that question is your next guest and that's Chuck Schumer, because the House did its job. The reason that House Republicans are home working in their districts, and I suspect House Democrats should be as well, is because we did that. We passed a bipartisan, very clean continuing resolution a couple of weeks back now, and sent it to the Senate. It's very important to note what was in that. It was only 24 pages in length, Margaret. It was a good faith effort to keep the government open for seven more weeks so that Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion, could work together to fund the government with the appropriations process. Chuck Schumer always voted for those in the past. In fact, he did it 13 times during the four years of the Biden administration, but now suddenly he's commanding his Democrats in the Senate not to do it, and there's one simple reason why. They need political cover from the far left corner of the base. He's afraid, Chuck Schumer, individually- ask him about it. He's afraid he's going to get a challenge from the Marxist left in his party, because that's the new wave in New York. That's what this is about. Chuck Schumer is trying to show a fight against the President and Republicans and real Americans are being harmed in the process of this political game.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, Democrats, as you know, want to have another conversation in regard to extending some tax subsidies that lower the cost of some health care that's purchased through the Obamacare market. To that point, though, you're talking about the politics of this, our CBS polling that we released today shows neither party's stance is viewed as worth shutting down this government. The Democrats want to talk about the tax credits. You know, premium pricing is already being set now, even if this doesn't expire until end of the year. Your fellow Republican, Jen Kiggans said, \"raising costs for families with little notice and potentially stripping them of access to care is simply unacceptable.\" Doesn't she have a point here?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: There's a lot of points to be made on that, and we're ready to talk about, negotiate and do all of that, but they're trying to create that as a red herring here right now. Margaret, this is a funding bootstrap measure, a very simple, very conventional thing that's been done here all the time. This is the way it works now. We need a little more time on the clock to finish the appropriations process. We have plenty of time to debate that very complicated issue. It's not a simple one. There has to be reforms to that subsidy, because there's a lot of fraud, waste and abuse involved in it. There's a- there's 535 members of Congress in the House and Senate. There's a- there's probably 400 different ideas on how to fix that, so we need a little time to do it. We're not saying that we won't negotiate it. We're saying turn the lights back on in Congress. Get troops paid TSA agents and border patrol agents paid who are trying to protect us. Restore the health care programs that are being stalled for veterans and Medicare recipients who are getting home health, it's all stalled now, restore FEMA flood insurance programs in the middle of hurricane--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. Turn the lights back on.--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- and WIC programs for young women. We got to get this fixed now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to clarify what you were just saying, do I hear you correctly? That you, as Speaker of the House, want to see the tax credit extended at a future date? Is that what you are saying?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No, I haven't staked out any position on it yet, because that's not how this process works. We're in a deliberative body--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Right, I'm asking your position because you said--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- I'm the speaker of the House--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- you'd be willing to talk about it--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- I'm telling you my position- I'm the Speaker of the House. What I have to do is draw consensus among 435 members of my body. I don't get out and project what the final conclusion is going to be. And I've told Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, most recently in the Oval Office with the President just five, six days ago, keep the government open so that we can do that job. We were always planning to do that. Again, that funding runs out December 31. The month of October is a critical time for us to get to this. But we can't when Chuck Schumer keeps voting to shut the government down for political reasons. That's purely and simply what's happening here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe you have time here, but our partner at health policy think tank KFF reported 80% of all premium tax credits went to ObamaCare enrollees in Trump won states. Red states. Do you really- do worry at all that this stance could backfire, that waiting to talk about the tax credit could hurt you and could hurt your voters?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No- no. No, because we have time to do it again. The funding doesn't run out until December 31st. We're talking about a September 30th deadline that's now passed to keep the government open so that Republicans and Democrats can have that very debate. Chuck Schumer has shut it off because he needs a political argument right now. 100% Margaret, that's what this is about. Play the tape. Play the tape of Chuck Schumer saying consistently for the last 30 years that CRs are dangerous, destructive, and selfish. He is now the captain of it, and it's on him. Republicans in the House, Senate, and the White House want to keep the government open, and we have voted to do so. Democrats are shutting it down--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are committing to have that conversation about health care is what I understand you saying?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: It was- it was always going to continue. They're making this up. That is a red herring. They're trying to- they're trying to say that this fight right now is about that. That wasn't even a fight. It's a joke. Call him on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the director of the Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, was on another network this morning, and said it is up to the President of the United States to decide when the mass layoffs will begin. He seems to be indicating the President is using those RIFs, those reduction-in-force threats, as leverage here. Do you know how quickly those layoffs will start?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: I don't know. I anticipate it will have to be soon, because Chuck Schumer turned off the funding sources and whomever is the chair of the office--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Do you want that as leverage?--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- No, nor- neither does the President. No. The President wants the government open. He's pleaded with Schumer and Hakeem in person in his office to do that, and they said no, because they want to do this. You know what they counter-proposed? They want to spend $1.5 trillion, and they want to return hard-working taxpayer dollars to fund health care for illegal aliens. It is in their bill. Go to\u00a0speaker.gov\u00a0and see it for yourself. Page 57, Section 2141. They're using this for political games, and it is shameful, and real people are getting hurt.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that- I have looked at that text, it doesn't explicitly say what you are indicating--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- Well, wait a minute--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But unauthorized immigrants are intelligible for ACA benefits--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- This is very important. Yes it does. It's- it says very simply, they want to repeal the changes that we made in the- in the Working Families Tax Cut, the One Big Beautiful Bill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's right--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- And what those changes were is it removed health care going to illegal aliens. It removed all the fraud, waste and abuse. And the Congressional Budget Office, CBO said it achieved the desired result. They project it will save almost $200 billion. Chuck Schumer's proposal on page 57 wants to return that $200 billion of taxpayer funds to pay for illegal aliens and other non-citizens. That is a fact, and you can check it out on my website\u00a0speaker.gov. Don't trust me. Look at Chuck Schumer's own paperwork.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, thank you for your time. This morning, we'll be right back with a lot more 'Face the Nation'. Stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the former Commanding General of the U.S. Army in Europe, retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. And he joins us from Germany. Welcome to 'Face The Nation.'",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL (RETIRED) BEN HODGES: Thank you very much, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up- pick up where we left off with Senator Duckworth, who is a Purple Heart recipient for her time serving this country in combat. Men and women have different basic fitness standards. The Secretary, in his remarks at Quantico, said women- or he suggested women were being given a pass or were held to lower standards for fitness requirements. Do you think his change to the quote unquote male standard is necessary?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: I think this is completely unnecessary. I have 38 years in the Army, and we've served with women in all sorts of different environments and deployments, and I never had a case where a female soldier was not able to do what she had to do. So this is a- seems to me an unnecessary, almost a medieval approach, that doesn't reflect the requirements that we have for women and men who are intelligent, able to operate in a modern battlefield environment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Defense Secretary made these remarks at Quantico last week, as you well know, ordered in our most senior military officers to hear him lay out what he talked about in terms of changing rules of engagement, those codes of conduct and standards to make war less brutal. The Secretary said this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY PETE HEGESTH: We also don't fight with stupid rules of engagement. We untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement. Just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for war fighters.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of those directives to officers?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, that's- that's not going to help anybody accomplish their mission. I mean, when you think about the missions that we had in Afghanistan, for example, and I think that's where some of his experience comes from. It was to protect Afghan civilians so that they could reestablish government and secure themselves, and so it was not about how many Taliban could you kill. We had already tried that, and that didn't work. So the rules of engagement are not 'politically correct.' They're not intended to make it harder for soldiers or units to do their job. They actually are part of the mission. Why are we there? And so I don't have any experience where killing a lot of innocent people or violating the Geneva Convention is going to help accomplish the mission. I think that the idea that we should- that somehow is going to make us better and more effective by people not having to worry about the law is going to be bad for us in the long term as well, both psychologically for soldiers, but also the trust of the American people and of our allies and American forces, where we have always lived up to international law, and that is where a lot of the respect came from. We do not want to be like the Russian army, and they certainly don't worry about rules of engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Geneva Conventions are something that the Secretary, as a private citizen, wrote about in his book and questioned whether they should be followed at all. He said, 'What if we treated the enemy the way they treated us?' And if I mean, he talked about Al Qaeda and using some of their tactics, it- rip their arms off, feed them to the hogs. I mean, this sounds tough, but in terms of practice, does it risk the lives of- of those who are the trigger pullers, those who are on the ground, to have this message delivered from the highest levels?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, first of all, the Geneva Conventions were constructed starting in 1949 after the Second World War, and they were intended to protect innocent people, helpless people, non-combatants, from the ravages of war, as it did happen in the Second World War. And I don't think anybody would say that Dwight Eisenhower was woke and here he was- he was Chief of Staff of the Army, and then Supreme Allied Commander, and then President. So this was during his time that the United States helped create and sign the Geneva Conventions. So here's a guy with more combat experience and wartime experience than almost anybody. Now, the- when you think about modern warfare, especially when you're counter terrorism, just as Secretary Rubio was describing earlier on your program, the people, how you deal with enemy and how you deal with populations, is how you defeat an insurgency. And killing everybody in sight is not how you defeat an insurgency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As Defense Secretary Hegseth fired the top military lawyers who advise on lethality, here's some of the advice he gave to senior leaders this week.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY PETE HEGESTH: You kill people and break things for a living in this profession, you feel comfortable inside the violence so that our citizens can live peacefully. Lethality is our calling card and victory our only acceptable end state.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think that means?",
      "BEN HODGES: Well, first of all, it's not connected to the reality of how these things happen, how wars are won. First of all, the political leadership has to describe the end state. What is what is it we're going to do? Why are we sending troops somewhere? What are they supposed to accomplish? And usually it's not going to be by killing everybody in sight. So I can't- I think there's a disconnect between this idea that it's all about lethality and that we kill people and break things. That's- that's not the mantra of any army unit I was ever in in 38 years. It was always about accomplish the mission that was assigned to us, carry out every lawful order, and do it in such a way that protects civilians and ensures that all of our soldiers are protected and come back home safe. This idea of break things and kill people, that's what the Russians did in Bucha and Mariupol. That's not who we are. We're the soldiers of a free, democratic country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President also spoke at that gathering. He referred to the 'enemy within'. He also spoke about using U.S. cities like Chicago as training grounds. Are you comfortable with people thinking that?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, look, I think first of all, U.S. military- our fellow citizens should be confident that U.S. military will always carry out lawful orders. And so it's alarming when all of the judge advocates general or the army- or the military lawyers are sacked or sent away because Commanders do need to have legal counsel as they receive orders and they look at these complex situations, but our troops will carry out lawful orders. I guarantee you that no soldier wants to have to use force against American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lieutenant General, thank you for your insights. We have to leave it there."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. Good morning, and good to have you here, in person. So, I have to ask you about what the President announced yesterday in regard to federalizing 300 National Guardsmen out in the state of Illinois. We've heard this threat going back all the way to August. The governor says these are not needed. Do you have any idea when they'll arrive?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I believe they're going to be Illinois National Guardsmen. So, they're not going to be coming from out of state. I spoke with our governor yesterday, and it looks like it's going to be about 300 Illinois Guardsmen who will be activated against the governor's wishes. So they'll be they'll be homegrown Illinoisans, and they're our brothers and sisters, our neighbors. I probably served with quite a number of them, certainly the leadership. And, you know, they'll be home. We'll welcome them. It's a misuse of the National Guard. They're they're not needed in this particular role. If President Trump really wanted to fight crime, then maybe he should stop defunding the police he, you know, he diverted $800 million in crime prevention efforts away from- that was appropriated away from funding for our police officers. So, you know, I- they're not needed, but we're going to welcome them, because they're our brothers and sisters, and we're proud of our National Guard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He has surged, or the federal government has surged, agents from different groups. The FBI said yesterday they're sending folks in. Tell me about these protests, because the images look pretty intense of what has happened between people on the streets of Chicago, we're showing some of that video now, around immigration issues. As I understand yesterday, ice authorities shot a Chicago woman in the Brighton Park area. Secretary Noem claimed ICE fired defensive shots at this woman, who was armed, who had appeared in a border patrol intelligence bulletin previously. She claims that federal agents were surrounded and were threatened. What are local authorities telling you about what they think happened here?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, they lie, right? The Trump administration lies. We have a president who is a known liar, and they have been- they've been lying about the situation all along. And, in fact, they even shot tear grenades- tear gas grenades, I think, at a reporter who was simply driving by with her window open. And so, we're urging people, we're urging our protesters, remain calm, peaceful protests, exercise the First Amendment rights. But video-tape everything. Everybody has a phone; tape everything, so we actually have real evidence of what is happening. We know the Trump administration lies consistently. And what I am hearing is that, for the large part, people are being very quiet, are being very respectful. But ICE is being very aggressive. Remember that they are zip-tying children. They are raiding apartment blocks in the middle of the night, separating children from their families, pulling people out onto the streets naked. They are using Gestapo tactics in Chicago, and this is what Trump wants to do, right? He wants to intimidate the people of Chicago. That's not going to happen, and we're going to document everything and make sure, just as the judge in Portland said, that these- these requirements, these orders from the Trump administration, are not actually tied to reality.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about President Trump's directive to send Oregon National Guard troops into Portland, and the judge said that- untethered to the facts. But, in this case, I mean, the Homeland Security Advisor says there's a large and growing movement of left-wing terrorism, organized and funded. They're posting, on Homeland Security, images of snipers. So we're not talking troops, we're talking about federal agents that are carrying out some of this right now. Have you seen any evidence of what Stephen Miller is describing here in terms of organization and targeting of federal agents?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: No, not at all. This is- it's simply not happening. They are lying. And so, if anybody is targeting anyone, it is out of control ICE agents targeting, again, zip-tying children, throwing reporters onto the ground, separating children from their mothers, trying to convince schools to turn over kids from public schools. They are raging through the streets of Chicago, trying to intimidate everyday, ordinary citizens, or just trying to go to school and go to work. That's not acceptable. That's not what America is about. And it is shameful that the present United States has instigated this on one of its greatest cities. He should be defending the city. He should be protecting the city. Send us the federal dollars that were appropriated in a bipartisan way to support law enforcement. They took money away from law enforcement officers, child prevention effort- violence against children prevention efforts. They- they've literally, this president, has defunded the police.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is counter their messaging, at least. But on the messaging around the military, I want to ask you about what happened at Quantico. And, just so our viewers are clear, you serve on Armed Services, but you retired from the National Guard. You were a lieutenant colonel.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: 23 years proud of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Blackhawk helicopter pilot in Iraq. You served in combat. Secretary Hegseth told senior military leaders just a few days ago he doesn't want to prevent women from serving, but he's now going to require everyone meet the male standard. Let's listen to that.",

If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.",
      "((END VIDEO CLIP))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How did you hear those remarks, and how do you think female service people heard them?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, this is the least qualified Secretary of Defense in our nation's history, and he's questioning the ability of the women who actually qualify to their- to do their jobs. The female Rangers, the female that graduated from seal school, have met those highest standards. And, by the way, he is obfuscating a little bit because there are different male standards. The standard for 45 year-old man is not the same as an 18 year-old man. So he doesn't actually talk about that. He has long sought to push women out of the military. And, frankly, our military could not do its job of protecting America and keeping us safe without the women who serve in the military. If you look at some lessons we learned in Afghanistan, for example, the lionesses, the Marine Corps group of women who actually went on patrol, all-female units that actually was able to get intelligence from women- Afghani women to get information on the enemy. Frankly, you've got a least qualified secretary of defense in the nation's history who wastes taxpayer dollars on a regular basis doing things like bringing in general and flag officers to be an audience for his dog and pony show, using them as little toy soldiers when they should be out there at your units in command, doing their jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time and for your insight. We'll be back in a moment."

    "summary": "Americans are concerned about effect of shutdown on economy, amid unease about jobs and inflation.",
    "story": [
      "For many Americans, across party lines, concern over the government shutdown means concern about its potential impact on the economy, among other things.",
      "Therefore, many don't think either party's position is worth having a shutdown over.",
      "Given that, no one is looking especially good politically at the moment. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans are all net negative on their handling of the shutdown thus far.",
      "Neither party is on very solid footing. The top descriptor Americans pick for the Democratic Party overall is \"weak;\" the party trails the GOP on being described as \"effective\" and \"strong,\" and their favorables trail the GOP's. The top descriptor for Republicans, though, is \"extreme.\"",
      "All of it looks to the public like another distraction from larger matters of concern. A sizable majority of the country says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices, and is focused too much on tariffs, as they have been for months. Reflecting some of that, many still describe the president himself as \"energetic,\" but fewer describe him now as \"focused\" than did at the start of his term.",
      "Relatively few Americans say the Democrats' or Republicans' positions are worth a shutdown. As it is still fairly recent, many aren't sure yet.",
      "For the Democrats, only half their rank and file think their party's positions are worth a shutdown, and even fewer Republicans say that of the GOP's positions. That said, they don't blame their respective parties for the situation, either.",
      "There's plenty of that blame to go around. Republicans and the president get relatively more than congressional Democrats, but taken together with Americans who blame both equally, a majority of the country holds all of them responsible.",
      "When asked what the shutdown debate is mainly about, health care is the top response from a list of issues, and those following the matter more closely pick that more often. That may speak to the parties' respective arguments getting at least to their bases.",
      "The percentage very concerned about the impact on the economy is higher than for other items.",
      "People also express concern, to a lesser degree, about the effects of the shutdown on federal employees. Also, the military, transportation and air travel, and Social Security and Medicare, which, even if they are not directly part of the negotiations, likely show that people tend to associate these programs with the government, generally.",
      "Still, overall views and descriptors of the parties aren't positive ones. Each has underwater favorability ratings overall, with the Republicans getting slightly better ratings than the Democrats.",
      "From a list of descriptors of the parties, it's a case of weak (the way most of the nation describes the Democratic Party) versus extreme (the most often-picked label for the GOP).",
      "The Republican Party greatly outpaces the Democrats on being called \"effective\" and \"strong.\"",
      "Over four in 10 rank-and-file Democrats describe their own party as weak.",
      "The economy and the president",
      "Against the backdrop of the shutdown, and helping explain why so many are concerned about its economic impact, inflation and the economy continue to be seen as the nation's top issues. And as has been the case for a while, a large majority says the Trump administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices. And most continue to say it is focused too much on tariffs.",
      "And most say Trump's policies are costing jobs in the U.S., rather than creating jobs.",
      "That's combined with Americans' view that Trump's policies aren't making them better off and are still making prices go up. On balance, the president's handling of inflation, specifically, has ticked down again.",
      "Fewer Americans now describe the president as \"focused\" than did at the start of his second term. His top descriptors remain \"tough\" and \"energetic,\" but the percentage who call him \"effective\" is also down compared to February.",
      "More broadly \u2014 and not specifically related to the shutdown, but perhaps pertinent given that situation \u2014 Americans still say it's Congress, not the president, who should have the most authority over federal spending. That's a view held by majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans.",
      "Donald Trump's overall approval rating, at 42%, is now back down to what it was in July, after hitting 44% last month. He remains bolstered by support from his Republican base, and still gets better marks on his deportation program and immigration than on inflation and the economy overall.",
      "At 43%, the president's approval rating on handling the conflict between Israel and Hamas is similar to what it was this summer, and higher than his approval ratings on economic issues. (This polling was conducted before reports of a possible ceasefire deal.)",
      "Troops and U.S. cities",
      "The idea of troops going to U.S. cities remains divisive. It's backed staunchly by the president's Republican base, especially those who identify as MAGA, but finds far less backing beyond it.",
      "Whether it's the National Guard specifically or active-duty military troops going to cities, views are similar. Much of it, beyond the partisan breaks, is tied to where one sees threats to the U.S. originating.",
      "Those who support troops in cities tend to see threats from inside the country, subscribing to some of the arguments made by the administration, that threats are coming from domestic enemies.",
      "But for the majority of Americans who see dangers more from economic forces, or who feel the U.S. military's overall focus ought to be outside the U.S., it is much less so.",
      "For decades now, a majority of Americans have backed having women who serve in the military participating in combat roles, and that continues to be the case today, at three-quarters, a view shared equally by men and women. The quarter of Americans who do not think women in the military should participate in combat roles tend to be more conservative.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,441 U.S. adults interviewed between October 1-3, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amy-coney-barrett-harassment-death-threats-supreme-court-term-2025/",
    "published": "Sun, 05 Oct 2025 08:06:22 -0400",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said of the Supreme Court's emergency orders in the Trump cases, \"This isn't the final decision.\"",
    "story": [
      "Whenever Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived at an auditorium or a library or a university last month to discuss her new book, she encountered a familiar sight: protesters.",
      "They lined the streets, chanting and carrying signs. One wore a handmaid's costume, a symbol of oppression. Another was dressed as liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death in 2020 created a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Trump would fill with Barrett.",
      "For Barrett, protesters have become routine, another logistical wrinkle in her everyday life, much like the ones who regularly gather at her home outside Washington, D.C., where she lives with her husband and younger children. What surprises her, she told me in a wide-ranging interview in her chambers late last month, is how she can let it roll off her back.",
      "\"If I had imagined before I was on the Court, how I would react to knowing that I was being protested, that would have seemed like a big deal, like, 'oh, my gosh, I'm being protested,'\" she says. \"But now I have the ability to be like, 'Oh, okay, well, are the entrances blocked?' I just feel very businesslike about it. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't disrupt my emotions.\"",
      "A fury of protests against conservative justices erupted in 2022, when news leaked that the Court was poised to overturn the landmark decision Roe v. Wade. Barrett, a conservative in the mold of her former mentor and boss Antonin Scalia, was a particular source of ire. Replacing Ginsburg, whose legal career was grounded in women's rights, she provided a key fifth vote to overturn Roe and let each state decide whether to allow abortion or not. But the decision also unleashed something much darker.",
      "On Friday, a California resident was sentenced to eight years in prison for the attempted assassination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who also voted to overturn Roe. Court papers revealed the perpetrator had also mapped out the homes of three other conservative justices, including Barrett's. Death threats have not gone away, and security remains high at their homes and whenever they appear in public.",
      "I asked Barrett if she is ever afraid. Her response was immediate and emphatic: \"I'm not afraid.\"",
      "\"You can't live your life in fear,\" she continued. \"And I think people who threaten \u2014 the goal is to cause fear. And I'm not afraid. I'm not going to reward threats with their intended reaction.\"",
      "That kind of mental discipline and self control, even in the face of threats and extreme criticism, reflects an outlook that has guided the 53-year-old Barrett much of her life.",
      "\"I don't make decisions emotionally. I try very hard not to let emotions guide decisions in any aspect of my life. The way that I respond to people, the choices that we make,\" she continues, adding with a laugh, \"apart from maybe some impulse buys of clothes or something.\"",
      "That outlook is also reflected in her approach to the law.",
      "On the Supreme Court, Barrett's opinions are highly analytical. She doesn't like to decide more than the issue at hand, which is one reason she has parted ways with conservative colleagues who would rather swing for the fences, like in a case two terms ago when the Court ruled states cannot remove Trump from the ballot. Barrett agreed on the bottom line, but had a more limited approach.",
      "As a former law professor, she can be formalistic and technical, qualities that also can separate her from other conservatives, as in a 2024 case that attempted to hold the Biden administration responsible for suppressing speech on social media during Covid.",
      "Now entering her sixth year on the Court, Barrett continues to defy stereotypes. Critics span the political spectrum, not only Democrats after she voted to overturn Roe, but more recently Republicans in the wake of decisions at odds with President Trump. She is \"confounding the Right and the Left,\" as the New York Times put it, raising hopes and fears on both sides.",
      "That's partly because, in decades past, some conservative justices have turned out to be anything but conservative. Would Barrett, too, go that route? And it's also in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the Court, reflecting an idea that the justices are mere political actors who should stay on their respective sides, regardless of the law.",
      "\"That is a notion that I try to disabuse people of in the book,\" she says.",
      "Correcting some of those public misperceptions that the Supreme Court is driven by politics or outcomes or is loyal to Trump is one of her main goals with her new book, \"Listening to the Law.\" She is part teacher, part tour guide, taking the reader inside the Court and highlighting some of its most controversial decisions to explain how the justices interpret the Constitution and the differences in conservative and liberal philosophies.",
      "And there is no case more controversial than the 5-4 decision overturning Roe, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Whole Health. Barrett uses it to explain how she and the Court's conservative majority interpret the Constitution with a method known as \"originalism,\" focusing on the Constitution's original meaning, the way the public understood it when it was adopted.",
      "In our interview, Barrett said she was drawn to originalism when she read Justice Scalia's opinions in a constitutional law class during her second year at Notre Dame Law School. She said she was frustrated after a first-year criminal law class, reading liberal decisions of the Warren Court and finding them to be \"unmoored.\" Scalia's opinions, with his originalist framework, made sense to her.",
      "\"I think I am different in style than Justice Scalia. I don't think I'm different in substance,\" she said. \"I think one thing that was important to Justice Scalia is fidelity to his analytical framework, so fidelity to textualism and originalism, even when it led to places that he didn't want to go.\"",
      "Scalia, for example, upheld flag burning as a First Amendment right, even though he said \"if I were king, I would not.\" With Barrett, an example is the death penalty. She upholds it as constitutional, even though it is at odds with her religious views.",
      "And that framework, she says, is how she approaches the cases involving Trump. While politicians, the media and the public are focused on the current occupant of the office, she says \"the Court has to take the long view.\"",
      "\"The way that we have to view cases is about the presidency, not about the president. We have to make a decision that's going to apply to six presidents from now, and that's how I try to view the law,\" she says. \"So in the same way that I do try to erase particular policies, or substitute in ones that I like or dislike \u2014 to try to maintain neutrality \u2014 I try to do that with the presidents too, because it can't turn on the president.\"",
      "Her critics aren't convinced, but Barrett seems unfazed by the attacks on her judgment or her character. In our conversation, and in multiple interviews with those who know her, she comes across as someone with a strong sense of self and an equally clear view on the right way to interpret the Constitution. Unlike some justices, she says she doesn't monitor what journalists and law professors and politicians say about the Court. She has seen them get it wrong. It doesn't matter to her.",
      "\"If I could have, especially as a 16-year-old, imagined that I would not care or be impervious to being criticized and mocked, I would have been very surprised,\" she says. \"And so I am glad, because I think this would be a miserable job if you let yourself care, if you let yourself be affected.\"",
      "Barrett first walked through the fire after Trump nominated her in 2017 to the Chicago-based federal appeals court. In her Senate hearings, she withstood withering attacks on her faith, notably when then-Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told her, \"the dogma lives loudly within you.\" Her steely performance impressed conservatives and helped get her on Trump's Supreme Court shortlist.",
      "Barrett was astonished by how she was portrayed by the media. (She said a cousin told her \"the person they were describing is not the person that I've known my whole life at all.\")",
      "A mother of seven, Barrett is a devout Catholic and proud daughter from a large and supportive family with deep roots in New Orleans. Before becoming an appeals court judge, she was a popular and respected Notre Dame law professor with sparkling credentials. Always a high achiever, she had received full scholarships to college and law school at Notre Dame, where she was top in her class (and met her future husband) and earned highly competitive clerkships with towering conservative icons, Judge Laurence Silberman and Scalia.",
      "\"One thing that I really disliked was this idea that I had no backbone, or that I was just this subservient woman in some way,\" she said, \"because I felt like I am anything but that.\"",
      "She had set goals for her life early on, and she made conscious and methodical choices to reach them. She wanted a big family like she grew up with, but, of course, she would work, so she wanted flexibility in her career.",
      "\"I really admired my parents, I really admired my grandparents, and I thought, if I want to be the kind of people that they are, I have to make definite choices,\" she told me. \"I have to decide what my values are, what my priorities are, and make definite choices and prioritize those kinds of things.\"",
      "Thinking about law school after college, she says she remembers sitting in her dorm room at Rhodes College and making a list of pros and cons, focusing on what mattered to her and \"I just reasoned my way to it.\" (Barrett, always analytical, mentions in her book that her life runs on to-do lists, but she also is partial to pro/con lists.)",
      "She's now the only justice on the Court who didn't attend an Ivy League school, but Barrett says she didn't care about labels or what was considered \"the best school.\" She didn't even apply to Harvard. She opted for Notre Dame over the University of Chicago, for instance, not only because she could prioritize her Catholic faith, but that it also offered a full scholarship. That meant no big student loans that would force her into an all-consuming, high-paying law firm job after graduation.",
      "Searching for a more accurate way to describe herself, Barrett uses the term \"Steel Magnolia.\"",
      "\"I've done a lot of traditionally feminine things. I have a large family. I've made unconventional choices in that way. And I'm not sorry to be feminine,\" she said. \"But I don't feel like I have to sacrifice that part. I think you can be traditional in some of those ways, and still have grit or the backbone or the spine. I felt like I had the grit.\"",
      "\"Grit\" is a word she uses more than once in the book when talking about strong women she admires, like her great-grandmother, a widow who raised 13 children in a tiny house \"bursting at the seams\" during the Great Depression. \"Somehow she always managed to find the resources, space and time,\" Barrett writes.",
      "Throughout our conversation, I'm struck by something she wrote early in the book, when she mentions advice her father gave to her and her siblings: \"Control your emotions, or your emotions will control you.\"",
      "It's similar to advice Justice Ginsburg liked to share from her mother: \"Don't be distracted by emotions like anger, envy, resentment. These just zap energy and waste time.\" Ginsburg would say her advice came in handy at the Court, because she learned that reacting with \"anger or annoyance will not advance one's ability to persuade.\"",
      "I asked Barrett if she, like Ginsburg, drew on that advice at the Court.",
      "\"Yes, in this job, I think it's part of the tuning out, that I can't let what people say\u2026certainly not affect the decisions that I make, but even affect how I feel,\" she says. \"If I let that in, and then let that affect my mood when I go home or when I'm relating to people, then that needs to be kept out.\"",
      "Having that mindset, Barrett says, is one of the things she's most proud of as justice, because that wasn't how she felt as a young teenager growing up in a family of nine.",
      "\"I felt very conspicuous. We would go into restaurants, and you could see people turning around and counting and looking,\" she says. \"In the preteen and teenage self-conscious years, I thought, I just want to be unnoticed. I'm never gonna have a family that attracts attention.\"",
      "Barrett rarely shows the kind of rhetorical fire or hyperbole some of her colleagues regularly exhibit. Stylistically, as she says, she is no Scalia. But with the Court increasingly under strain as it grapples with dozens of emergency requests from the Trump administration, Barrett exhibited a flash of pique last term, responding to a fiery dissent by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in the case limiting the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "Jackson, a Biden appointee and the Court's newest member, accused the Court of engaging in \"legalese.\" Barrett, speaking for the majority, responded: \"We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries with of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself.\"",
      "In the months since, Jackson has only ratcheted up her rhetoric as the Court has issued temporary orders in a range of cases brought by the Trump Administration. In one emergency order last month, on whether Trump could cancel grants to the National Institutes of Health, Jackson impugned the conservatives' motives.",
      "Jackson accused them of having \"no fixed rules\" except \"this Administration always wins\" something Barrett pointed out in an event last month was obviously false. (Just one high-profile example: The Court ruled against the Administration's deportation of Kilmar Albrego Garcia and ordered it to work toward his return to the U.S.)",
      "Still, Barrett insists that kind of language doesn't affect her relationship with Jackson, and that she works to have relationships with all the other justices. She says she enjoys talking about the law with Justice Elena Kagan, also a former law professor who, like Barrett has a more formalistic approach to the law than the Court's two other liberals, even though it leads them to very different places.",
      "In a recent interview, Bari Weiss of The Free Press asked Barrett to give one word for each of her colleagues. For Kagan, Barrett chose \"analytical.\" That's a word she also used in our conversation to describe herself.",
      "\"You can't take it personally, and so I think you just have to understand and see opinions for what they are: disagreements about ideas,\" Barrett said of the dissents. \"I intend my opinions to be about the ideas, not about the people, and I think a big part of life is assuming the best of other people.\"",
      "Barrett doesn't seem like a person who dwells in regret. But she said she saw a \"missed opportunity\" on her cross-country book tour, and she wished she'd emphasized how the emergency orders in the Trump cases are different. Always a teacher, she wants to explain these orders aren't the last word.",
      "\"I don't think the public is really aware this isn't the final decision. If a district court enters a preliminary injunction, and we enter a stay of that preliminary injunction, it's not saying the administration wins,\" she says. \"It's simply saying that the administration\u2026can continue to pursue whatever policy it is, because it has not been finally decided yet.\"",
      "In other words, she says, these interim orders \u2014 whether they're allowing Mr. Trump to cut grants or foreign aid or fire political appointees from federal agencies \u2014 are short-term, preliminary decisions. The Court is allowing Mr. Trump to pursue those policies for now, but if he ultimately loses on the underlying merits, the aid money will have to be spent and the employees reinstated with back pay.",
      "And Mr. Trump, I said, may not win them all?",
      "\"Right,\" Barrett said.",
      "It may look different, I asked, once you're deciding the merits?",
      "\"100 percent,\" she said.",
      "For now, one factor weighing in Mr. Trump's favor is the Court's assessment of the harm caused when unelected judges reflexively block policies enacted by popularly elected representatives. Because litigation can take years to resolve, those policies may never end up taking effect. The harm caused by judicial interference, the Court has explained, is to the democratic process.",
      "\"The case that we always cite is Maryland v. King, and it points out that any time a policy of one of the politically accountable branches or politically accountable state legislatures or governor is stopped, that, in itself, is an irreparable harm because you are affecting the people,\" she says. \"It was the people's preferred policy. The president is the one that they elected. The members of whatever legislature, state or Congress, are the ones that people elected.\"",
      "\"I may disagree, or agree, with whatever choices the people have made in the selection of their representatives,\" she said. \"But the people have made this choice.\"",
      "Beyond the obvious strain on the Court, the unprecedented crush of emergency appeals also has put pressure on lower court judges, and some have complained publicly that the Court's brief orders aren't giving them enough guidance. But Barrett, always methodical, says more guidance at the preliminary stage would come at a cost, raising the risk of locking the Court into its views before it has fully considered the issues.",
      "\"I do think opinions are important,\" she says. \"I don't know that it's always valuable to have an interim opinion that comes before the final opinion.\"",
      "Barrett, like all the justices when speaking in public, is exceedingly careful with her words. She won't discuss any upcoming issues or cases, or give any hint on how the Court may see the underlying merits. Even her book tour seemed like an exercise in not making news, and she succeeded.",
      "But she will have that opportunity soon enough: The justices already have agreed to decide whether Mr. Trump can impose far-ranging tariffs and fire members of certain federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. In the interim, it's allowing him to pursue tariffs and fire some Biden-appointed commissioners, though not on the Fed. Other cases, including birthright citizenship, are on the horizon.",
      "Beyond the Trump cases, the Court this term also will confront controversial cases on gun rights, voting rights, campaign finance reform and whether students who identify as transgender can play girls sports. The tensions and commentary will not ease anytime soon.",
      "For Barrett, that means staying the course, following her own internal compass and tuning out the noise, because one thing is certain. Whatever the Court decides in any of the cases, she says, \"somebody's going to be mad.\" It's a part of her life now.",
      "\"I just think you have to know who you are,\" she says, \"and make decisions that you decide are right, and stick with your priorities and not worry about the feedback you get from others, whether it's negative or whether it's positive.\"",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hopes to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza \"in the coming days,\" after Hamas said it has agreed to parts of the peace plan that President Trump\u00a0outlined earlier this week.",
      "In a brief statement late Saturday, Netanyahu said he has sent a delegation to Egypt \"to finalize technical details,\" adding that \"our goal is to contain these negotiations to a time frame of a few days.\"",
      "But Netanyahu signaled there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, something Hamas has long demanded.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said in a statement that while they agreed to parts of the peace deal, including the demand to release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the group suggested other portions of the deal should be subject to negotiation.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News the United States views Hamas' response as positive, though there are details that still need to be hammered out, such as the decommissioning of weapons, which may begin as soon as next week.",
      "After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said Friday on Truth Social that he believes the group is \"ready for a lasting PEACE.\" He pushed Israel to cease hostilities in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out,\" the president wrote.",
      "\"In light of Hamas's response, Israel is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump's plan for the immediate release of all hostages,\" a statement released by Netanyahu's office early Saturday morning local time read. \"We will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set forth by Israel that are consistent with President Trump's vision.\"",
      "In a separate statement, the Israel Defense Forces said that its high-level military officials held a meeting overnight, in which Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, \"instructed to advance readiness for the implementation of the first phase of the Trump plan for the release of the hostages.\"",
      "An Israeli political source told CBS News that the cessation of the IDF's activity in the Gaza Strip is intended to allow Hamas to begin organizing for the release of the hostages. The source added that this is not an official ceasefire that would require Hamas to return the hostages within 72 hours, as outlined in the plan.",
      "\"This is not the beginning of a withdrawal, although there may be tactical improvements for the purpose of protecting our soldiers,\" the source added. \"We are constantly examining what is happening on the ground and will not allow the terrorist organizations to try to take advantage of the opportunity and carry out a last-minute attack, or to strengthen their grip on the ground.\"",
      "The source said the negotiations are expected to begin on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, another source familiar with Israel's negotiation team told CBS News that it was getting ready to travel.",
      "U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is set to travel to Egypt for the talks, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, is also expected to attend. CBS News has reached out to the White House for more details.",
      "In a video posted to Truth Social later Friday, Mr. Trump called the deal \"unprecedented in many ways\" and thanked several Arab and majority Muslim countries that assisted with the deal as mediators, including Qatar and Egypt.",
      "\"This is a big day,\" Mr. Trump said in the video. \"We'll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down and concrete.\"",
      "In a follow-up post to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump wrote: \"After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, which will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!\"",
      "The post included a map of what the proposed withdrawal line could look like.",
      "Also Saturday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second most powerful militant group in Gaza, said it accepted Hamas' response to the Trump plan. The group had previously rejected the proposal days earlier.",
      "Hamas says it's willing to release hostages, hand over control of Gaza",
      "Hamas said it is willing to release all living hostages and the remains of deceased hostages \"in accordance with the exchange formula set forth in President Trump's proposal.\" The proposal laid out by the White House called for Hamas to release all hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, within 72 hours, and for Israel to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the conflict.",
      "The deal also called for an immediate end to fighting if both sides accept the deal, and for Israel's military to withdraw to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "Hamas also said it is willing to \"hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and with the support of Arab and Islamic parties\" \u2014 another portion of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Egyptian official told the AP that talks are underway for the release of hostages, as well as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The official, who is involved in the ceasefire negotiations, also said Arab mediators are preparing for a comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians. The talks are aimed at unifying the Palestinian position toward Gaza's future.",
      "The group was less clear on other portions of the deal. The statement said some aspects of Mr. Trump's proposal \"remain linked to a comprehensive national stance, grounded in relevant international laws and resolutions.\" It said those issues will need to be discussed \"within an inclusive Palestinian national framework\" that includes Hamas.",
      "It's not clear if Hamas has agreed that it will play no role in the governance of Gaza, which was one provision of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "The plan, unveiled Sept. 29 by Mr. Trump and backed by Netanyahu, called for Hamas to free all remaining Israeli hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases, starting with an initial withdrawal before the hostages are freed. It also proposed handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" Palestinian committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Netanyahu, who joined Mr. Trump for a joint news conference at the White House when the 20-point proposal was announced, had said he supports the plan, and that if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "\"We're giving everybody a chance to have this done peacefully,\" Netanyahu had said, warning Hamas what would happen if they didn't agree to the proposal. \"But if Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done.\"",
      "The president told Netanyahu on Monday that if Hamas were to reject the proposal, \"you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had said his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\" The president on Monday also said he and Netanyahu were \"waiting for signatures and waiting for approvals from a lot of different countries that are involved in this.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",

    "summary": "Most believe people do get along, but politics drives them apart.",
    "story": [
      "There's widespread apprehension among Americans: They overwhelmingly decry political violence, saying it is unacceptable.",
      "Yet they also think it will increase in the coming years.",
      "Notably, Americans of all political stripes say violence is unacceptable; there's no meaningful difference between views of partisans on this. There are some differences according to age, though, with older Americans especially likely to call political violence unacceptable, and they do almost universally.",
      "This concern is not entirely new and has even increased over recent years.",
      "Concern over political violence also relates to a majority's pessimism that people of different political stripes can come together.",
      "It does, however, stand in contrast to a generally positive view that most hold about people, apart from politics: that they do get along, but that politics drives them apart.",
      "Older Americans are more likely to think people get along than younger ones. This may be a generational difference, marked by more time spent before a hyper-partisan era; older Americans are even more likely than younger ones to say civility has gotten worse over time.",
      "At the same time, we aren't all talking to each other.",
      "Fewer than half feel comfortable publicly expressing political views. Half the public says they almost never have a political discussion with someone who holds different views. Most say they never have such an interaction online (perhaps because people can readily self-select into groups that agree with them.) And only one in 10 hold such conversations a lot.",
      "The number who report talking in person to people with different political views is lower than it was four years ago.",
      "That may be partly because there's a perception about negative outcomes for people who do express views publicly.",
      "In general, most think doing so can lead to insults, to threats, or employment problems just as much \u2014 if not more than \u2014 more positive outcomes, like finding others who share those views, or building support.",
      "Majorities of Americans of all ages and across the political spectrum say they don't feel American culture and society respects them. But those who are more comfortable publicly expressing political opinions are more likely to feel that society does respect them.",
      "Relatedly, big majorities across party lines say the tone and civility of politics has gotten worse. This, too, is not new. Americans have overwhelmingly felt this in recent years, when asked.",
      "When partisans look at the other side of the aisle, do they see political opposition, or enemies? Mostly, it's opposition, not enemies. But that's not universal. Just under half of Democrats say Republicans, when they win, threaten their way of life, much as they said four years ago. Just over a third of Republicans see Democrats as enemies, and that's a little fewer than thought so four years ago; at the time, Democrats had more sway in Washington than they do today.",
      "And in sum, there is majority pessimism right now that Americans can put aside political views and work out their differences. That pessimism spans party lines, though Republicans are relatively more optimistic than Democrats - and younger Americans are somewhat more optimistic than older ones.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between September 30-October 2, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday became the latest court to determine the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship\u00a0is likely unconstitutional.",
      "In a 100-page ruling, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Boston district court's injunction that blocked the government from enforcing an\u00a0executive order\u00a0signed by President Trump to significantly narrow birthright citizenship, the concept that people born in the U.S. are automatically citizens, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The appeals court ruled in favor of plaintiff states and against the Trump administration.",
      "Other cases\u00a0challenging the president's effort to restrict birthright citizenship have been making their way through the courts, and they haven't been decided in the president's favor.",
      "\"Our nation's history of efforts to restrict birthright citizenship \u2014 from Dred Scott in the decade before the Civil War to the attempted justification for the enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act in Wong Kim Ark \u2014 has not been a proud one,\" the court's chief justice wrote. \"Indeed, those efforts each have been rejected, once by the people through constitutional amendment in 1868 and once by the court relying on the same amendment three decades later, and at a time when tensions over immigration were also high.\"",
      "\"The 'lessons of history' thus give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one's parents rather than \u2014 in all but the rarest of circumstances \u2014 the simple fact of being born in the United States,\" the appeals court concluded.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on the ruling.",
      "In Mr. Trump's first week in office, he signed an executive order that sought to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868, has long been interpreted to automatically grant citizenship to virtually everybody born on U.S. soil, even if their parents are in the country illegally or temporarily. Federal judges in several states have blocked the order from taking effect.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship executive order in two different cases, one brought by four states and another by parents whose children would be impacted by the policy.",
      "The birthright citizenship issue reached the high court earlier this year, but the justices did not rule on the merits, instead curtailing lower court judges' power to issue nationwide injunctions blocking Mr. Trump's executive order.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Monday for the start of its new term, with cases involving \"conversion therapy\" for minors, the use of race in redistricting, gun rights and state laws barring the participation of transgender athletes in girls' sports on the docket.",
      "But looming over the high court's newest term are legal battles involving President Trump's policies and efforts to reshape the executive branch \u2014 two will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming months, though others could be poised for its intervention.",
      "The justices are returning to the bench following a summer recess marked by emergency appeals from the Trump administration on his immigration policies, efforts to cancel research grants, and mass layoffs of federal workers, among others. Mr. Trump has prevailed in most of his bids for emergency relief so far, but whether he will see similar success if the Supreme Court evaluates the merits of his plans remains to be seen.",
      "\"Most Americans aren't following the technicalities on the emergency docket, and so they just think the court is siding with the Trump administration every time,\" Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at William & Mary, told CBS News. \"Once the cases are back up before the justices and decided on the merits, that's going to do a lot to either cement that assumption or upset that assumption.\"",
      "The president will see the first test of one of his policies Nov. 5, when the Supreme Court considers the legality of his sweeping reciprocal tariffs, which are a centerpiece of his economic agenda. The high court is also set to decide whether Mr. Trump can fire without cause a Democratic-appointed member of the Federal Trade Commission. A decision in favor of the president in that case could invalidate removal protections enacted by Congress for a slew of independent agencies it sought to insulate from political pressure.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has also been asked to decide the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though it'll be weeks before the high court decides whether to take up the issue.",
      "Roman Martinez, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins who frequently argues before the court, predicted that come next summer, \"the theme is going to be that the court had to confront an energetic executive, very expansive assertions of authority across this whole range of issues.\"",
      "The cases already set to be decided, coupled with those that are likely to be teed up for Supreme Court review, suggest that the term will be marked by disputes involving social issues and challenges to Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"The docket is already full of blockbuster cases, and that list is going to grow as challenges to the president's executive orders find their way back to the justices after having been dealt with on the emergency docket,\" Larsen said.",
      "Here are the major cases the Supreme Court will hear this term:",
      "\"Conversion therapy\" ban",
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Oct. 7 in a challenge to a Colorado law that bans \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Nearly half the states have similar laws in place.",
      "The law, which took effect in September 2019, prohibits \"conversion therapy\" for people under the age of 18. The state defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who performs faith-informed counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body,\" according to court filings. But she fears that doing so will leave her in violation of Colorado's law and put her at risk of losing her license.",
      "Chiles sued the state and licensing officials in 2022, arguing that the ban violates her First Amendment rights by censoring her speech based on viewpoint and the content of her conversations. She sought to block Colorado from enforcing it against her.",
      "Colorado officials, meanwhile, argued that its law regulates professional health care treatment to ensure patients receive quality care. States have for centuries regulated professional health care to protect patients from substandard treatment, they said, and the First Amendment has never forbidden states from doing that.",
      "A federal district court ruled for Colorado, finding that its prohibition regulates professional conduct by forbidding certain speech made in a professional context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision. The appeals court divided 2-1 in finding that the restriction regulates professional conduct that only incidentally burdens speech.",
      "The use of race in redistricting",
      "On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court will consider for the second time the Louisiana congressional map drawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "But the stakes for the case this time around are much higher: The justices are weighing whether the Constitution allows a state to intentionally create a second majority-minority congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"The outcome of the case will not only determine the next steps for Louisiana's congressional map but may also shape the future of redistricting cases nationwide and forecast the resiliency of our nation's democratic values,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told reporters during a call.",
      "The long-running dispute involves the interplay between Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In this case, state lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district to address a Section 2 violation, but bumped up against the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits racial gerrymandering.",
      "The case dates back to the first congressional map drawn by Louisiana Republicans and enacted in 2022, which consisted of one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts. African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "A district judge ruled that map likely violated Section 2 because it deprived minority voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate. So Louisiana state lawmakers went back to the drawing board and crafted a new map that contained a second majority-minority district.",
      "Republicans said the re-drawn districts brought the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act and protected key GOP incumbents in the U.S. House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee.",
      "But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-Americans\" challenged that new map as a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment, and a three-judge panel of district judges agreed. It found that race predominated in drawing the new voting boundaries.",
      "Last March, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to keep Louisiana's re-crafted map in place. But in June, it ordered further arguments this term and later asked the parties \u2014 Louisiana officials, the 12 non-African-American voters, and a separate group of Black Louisianans \u2014 to address whether Louisiana's intentional creation of the second majority-minority House district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments.",
      "While Louisiana officials first defended the re-shaped House district lines, they now say the creation of the second majority-Black district in its new voting map violates the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court has typically given map-drawers breathing room to navigate the requirements of Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, but the Louisiana case could lead to a weakening of Section 2.",
      "In a 2023 decision that upheld the constitutionality of Section 2 as applied to redistricting, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that there should be an end to the drawing of voting boundaries based on race at some point. In a concurring opinion, he wrote \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier this year that he would be imposing sweeping baseline tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, to address \"chronic trade deficits\" that he said \"are no longer merely an economic \u2014 they're a national emergency.\" He also imposed levies on products from Canada, Mexico and China because of what he said was their failure to stop illicit drugs from flowing into the U.S.",
      "The president used a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to implement the tariffs. That law gives the president the authority to declare a national emergency to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. Once the president declares a national emergency, IEEPA gives the president the authority to take certain actions, including to regulate importation.",
      "Mr. Trump declared national emergencies related to trade deficits and drug trafficking, and imposed the tariffs under IEEPA to address them.",
      "A group of 12 states and small businesses filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's tariffs, arguing that IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose his global levies. A federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that Mr. Trump's tariffs are illegal. A federal district court in Washington, D.C., also reached the same conclusion.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and it agreed to hear the cases on an expedited basis.",
      "The high court has in the past been skeptical of broad presidential authority when it involves what are known in administrative law as \"major questions\" of vast economic and political significance, like when it invalidated former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. But the Trump administration has argued that this delegation of power involves foreign affairs and national security, and his determination that tariffs are best suited to address trade-deficit and drug-trafficking emergencies warrant deference.",
      "Martinez predicted the debate in the case will be about textualism and how to look at the language in IEEPA, as well as principles like the major questions doctrine, deference and nondelegation that have been embraced by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "\"These are all the same kinds of arguments that the conservative side of the court has been pushing very strongly in recent years to limit the use and some would say abuse of executive branch authority,\" Martinez, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, said during an event hosted by Georgetown Law. \"It will be interesting to see how those same principles are applied in this context, where you have a Republican president with a major policy initiative.\"",
      "Campaign finance",
      "The Supreme Court has in a string of recent decisions unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, which has allowed more money to flow into politics. The latest campaign finance dispute before the justices could follow that trend.",
      "At issue in the case is a 50-year-old provision of campaign finance law that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, two GOP campaign committees, along with then-Senate candidate JD Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio argued these limits were unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. But since that ruling 24 years ago, the makeup of the high court has changed significantly and now has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Republicans appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "State laws targeting transgender athletes",
      "On the heels of its June decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court said it would decide whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The justices will be looking at laws from Idaho and West Virginia to determine whether they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and, in the case involving West Virginia, Title IX. Idaho was the first state to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and roughly two dozen have enacted similar laws.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in February that aimed to keep transgender girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity.",
      "The Idaho case was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University and wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore. She has been treated for gender dysphoria for several years, including receiving testosterone suppression and estrogen.",
      "A U.S. district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding the ban discriminates against transgender women. A federal appeals court upheld the injunction as applied to Hecox.",
      "Months after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, Hecox decided to dismiss her lawsuit for personal reasons and because of \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters.\" Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to toss out the appeals court's decision and order the case to be dismissed.",
      "The West Virginia case involves Becky Pepper-Jackson, who receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy and wanted to participate in girls' athletics in middle school. A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the ban only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling it likely violates Title IX and the Constitution.",
      "But in 2023, the judge sided with the state and upheld the law, finding that the state can legislate sports rules because sex and the physical characteristics that flow from it are related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.",
      "A federal appeals court ruled in 2024, though, that the West Virginia law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Trump's power to fire executive officers",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to overhaul the executive branch, including by firing Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies without cause. He has removed those officers despite federal laws shielding them from being terminated unless for inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.",
      "Lower courts have repeatedly sided with the fired officials and ordered them to be reinstated. But the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "After allowing those other firings, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether for-cause removal protections violate the separation of powers. It will also decide whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "\"These are cases that raise really profound questions about presidential power \u2026 about Congress' ability to design institutions of government and to insulate certain important functions from the political whims of the day, whether it be setting interest rates or deciding labor relations or nuclear safety,\" lawyer Deepak Gupta told reporters at the Georgetown Law event. Gupta represents Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired from her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "One of the disputes before the high court, which has not yet been scheduled for argument, involves Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who Mr. Trump removed from her post at the Federal Trade Commission. A district court ruled the president violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing a FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "When the case landed before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it allowed Mr. Trump to oust Slaughter, and the high court said it would decide the constitutionality of removal protections for the FTC.",
      "The case puts in the Supreme Court's crosshairs a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to enact removal restrictions for officials at certain independent agencies, which the high court has chipped away at in recent years.",
      "The second case, involving Cook, will be argued in January. Mr. Trump attempted to fire Cook from the Fed board after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud. The effort to remove her is unprecedented, as no president has attempted to fire a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any criminal offense. A federal judge ruled in September that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her termination.",
      "The judge also said Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before she was ousted.",
      "A federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to allow the president to fire Cook and agreed with the lower court that Cook did not receive adequate process before her attempted removal. The two-judge majority did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump asked the justices to let him remove Cook from the Fed Board while the challenge to her firing moved forward. But the high court declined to immediately rule on his request for relief, and instead said it will hear arguments in January.",
      "By putting off a decision, the Supreme Court let Cook remain a Fed governor while it considers the issue.",
      "Gun rights",
      "Just before the start of the new term, the Supreme Court said it will decide whether Hawaii can stop people with concealed-carry permits from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public, unless they receive \"express authorization\" from the property owner.",
      "The case involves firearms restrictions enacted in Hawaii in 2023, on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights. The measure prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying handguns on different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",
      "The restriction at issue in the case before the Supreme Court bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing handguns onto private property unless they receive permission from the property owner. Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York \u2014 have similar laws that require a property owner's approval before carrying firearms on private property, such as by posting signs stating that guns are allowed.",
      "The Hawaii Firearms Coalition and three gun owners with concealed-carry permits challenged the law in June 2023, and a federal appeals court ultimately upheld the provision related to private property.",
      "Lawyers for the gun owners argued that the 9th Circuit effectively found that the Second Amendment does not apply to private property open to the public, rendering \"illusory the right to carry in public.\" The Trump administration had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to take up the dispute, warning that because few property owners post signs allowing or prohibiting guns, Hawaii's restriction functioned as a \"near-complete ban on public carry.\"",
      "Hawaii officials, meanwhile, said the rule regarding private property \"represents a permissible effort to vindicate the rights of Hawaii's citizens.\" They argued that under its law, a person who wants to bring a gun into a store can simply ask for oral permission.",
      "Since its June 2022 decision recognizing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms extends to outside the home, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of a number of longstanding firearms restrictions and state laws. Last year, the high court upheld a federal law prohibiting people subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having firearms.",
      "But it has also declined to take up challenges to state bans on assault weapons and other federal measures.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-split-up-mmr-vaccine-long-settled-debate/",
    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's suggestion\u200b that the combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccine should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's suggestion last week that combination childhood vaccines, including the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, shot, should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice in the United States.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"Those vaccines don't even exist in the U.S.\"",
      "Moss said he hadn't heard such a recommendation \"since the Andrew Wakefield days,\" referring to the former doctor whose 1988 autism study was later retracted as fraudulent.",
      "Investigations revealed Wakefield had undisclosed financial interests in both lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and a single-measles vaccine patent. His license to practice medicine was revoked.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks also drew in Wakefield himself. In a video posted on social media, he said the president was \"adopting the very recommendation that I made back in 1998,\" when he first called for splitting the MMR vaccine into individual components.",
      "\"This is a return to a discredited strategy,\" Moss said. \"Wakefield had a financial stake in undermining MMR, and the science has never supported his claims.\"",
      "Risks of splitting the MMR vaccine",
      "The stakes of splitting a combination vaccine are not abstract, Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical historian, said.",
      "\"The immunization schedules are very carefully worked out so the vaccines have the most immunogenicity at the right age,\" he explained. \"If you start splitting things up, you create barriers. Parents don't always come back, or they pick and choose, and coverage goes down. It's as simple as that.\"",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, argued that the call to split vaccines is part of a broader campaign to discredit vaccinations.",
      "\"Every couple of weeks, there's a new zinger: first thimerosal, then spacing, then aluminum, now splitting MMR,\" he said. \"Eventually, this topples the whole vaccine infrastructure like a house of cards.\"",
      "The medical risks of dismantling the MMR schedule are clear. Measles remains one of the most contagious viruses in circulation, capable of igniting outbreaks wherever vaccination rates dip. Rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, leaving babies with deafness, blindness or heart defects. Mumps, too often dismissed as mild, can lead to infertility in adolescent males.",
      "The programmatic consequences are equally significant. Moss pointed out that parents already complain about too many injections. Splitting MMR into separate shots would increase both the number of visits and the number of needles children face, while weakening protection against rubella and mumps.",
      "Every extra appointment creates barriers, especially for families with limited resources, Markel said.",
      "Dr. Walt Orenstein, a former head of CDC's immunization program, described combination vaccines as the foundation of modern prevention.",
      "\"Combination vaccines were developed to reduce missed opportunities, increase coverage and minimize the trauma of multiple injections,\" he said. \"Undoing that progress would put children at risk.\"",
      "Measles-only vaccines also don't exist in the U.S. You can't walk into a pediatrician's office or retail pharmacy and ask for a standalone shot.",
      "To make a measles-only vaccine available in the United States, a manufacturer would need to wait for measles outbreaks to occur, in order to test the vaccine in new clinical trials. Then they'd have to submit data for FDA approval and build a production and distribution system essentially from scratch. With no market for monovalent measles vaccines, companies would also have to be convinced there was sustainable demand \u2014 something experts say is unlikely given the entrenched use of MMR.",
      "Recycled claims",
      "Objections to combined vaccines are not new, UC Berkeley medical historian Elena Conis noted.",
      "\"Resistance to vaccines and concerns about the form and content of vaccines is as old as vaccination itself,\" she said. \"And concerns about combined vaccines are as old as combined vaccines themselves.\"",
      "She pointed out that even before Wakefield, parents in the 1970s were asking why they couldn't just get some vaccines separately, echoing debates over the DPT (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) vaccine at the time.",
      "New momentum to separate measles from the rubella component is also driven by a recurring myth: that the rubella vaccine \"contains fetal parts.\" In reality, the rubella virus was originally grown in human fetal cell lines developed in the 1960s, which have been replicated ever since without further abortions.",
      "During production, the virus is purified, leaving only trace DNA or protein fragments that are broken, biologically inactive, and present at levels far below natural background levels in food or the human body. Regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration confirm these levels are safe. Advocates for separating MMR often conflate this history with the false claim that vaccines contain fetal tissue. Decoupling rubella is presented as a moral corrective, even though it introduces practical barriers and undermines protection for pregnant women and babies.",
      "Conis also emphasized that resistance often depends on how people perceive the seriousness of each disease.",
      "The public didn't always see the various infections as equal, Conis noted. At times rubella drew more fear than measles or mumps.",
      "Mumps in particular, she said, \"was often treated with humor rather than fear, until the MMR vaccine came along and researchers began to highlight complications like infertility and hearing loss.\"",
      "Japan offers a cautionary example. In the early 1990s, Japan withdrew the combined MMR vaccine following concerns about the safety of its mumps vaccine and reverted to measles-only shots. The result was lower uptake of rubella and mumps vaccines compared to measles, leaving gaps in protection.",
      "Decades later, Japan has faced repeated rubella outbreaks, including epidemics in 2013 and 2018-2019 that sickened thousands and led to cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Because of earlier policies that vaccinated only girls against rubella, large cohorts of adult men remain under-immunized, forcing costly catch-up campaigns and leaving Japan vulnerable to epidemics.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned splitting up the MMR vaccine would repeat past mistakes.",
      "\"We've been here before. Andrew Wakefield promoted single-antigen vaccines, and it nearly derailed measles control in the U.K. The science was fraudulent, but the damage was real: thousands of kids went unprotected. To revive that model in 2025 is to repeat one of the most damaging chapters in vaccine history.\"",
      "Columbia University historian James Colgrove noted that this kind of backlash has deep roots.",
      "\"The original anti-vaccination movement in the 19th century was really a movement against state coercion,\" he said. \"That's always been the paradox of compulsory vaccination: it's extremely effective, but it's also one of the most likely to trigger backlash.\"",
      "Conis framed the debate in broader terms of autonomy and mandates.",
      "\"There's always been a tension in vaccination between individual choice and public health,\" she said. \"Parents are asked to give up some autonomy for the promise of better health for the population. For some, that's acceptable. For others, individual freedom matters more, and what's different today is that we're seeing the libertarian approach gain support at the highest levels of government.\"",
      "Colgrove added that policymakers face a delicate balance. \"The non-medical exemptions absolutely make laws more politically acceptable and are really key to diffusing backlash,\" he said. \"At the same time, the broader your exemption, the more people you allow to opt out, then the more you risk compromising herd immunity. So it really is threading the needle.\"",
      "And for Offit, the bigger danger is the pattern of misinformation itself.",
      "\"These claims aren't new; they're recycled,\" he said. \"Once doubt takes root, it's extraordinarily hard to restore public confidence.\"",
      "Research from multiple countries shows that combination vaccines improve uptake and timeliness by reducing missed appointments and the number of injections required. Children receiving combination formulations are more likely to complete their full schedule on time, and low-income parents are less likely to fall behind when multiple protections are delivered in a single shot.",
      "For Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program who recently resigned, the proposal reflects politics rather than science.",
      "\"This isn't about safety. It's about ideology,\" he said. \"We've already seen directives issued without data to back them up.\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the CDC's chief science and medical officer, echoed the concern.",
      "\"The talk about separating MMR into individual components wasn't coming from scientists,\" she said. \"It was being driven by political operatives with no public health expertise.\"",
      "According to Moss: \"It's not necessary, and monovalent vaccines aren't even available in the United States. There's no reason to go down that path.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

      "A mysterious \"rogue planet\"\u00a0has been observed gobbling 6 billion tons of gas and dust a second \u2014 an unprecedented rate that blurs the line between planets and stars, astronomers said Thursday.",
      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",
      "\"People may think of planets as quiet and stable worlds, but with this discovery we see that planetary-mass objects freely floating in space can be exciting places,\" V\u00edctor Almendros-Abad, a lead author of the new study, said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "\"Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?\"",
      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 09:51:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Enceladus has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",
    "story": [
      "The ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn's moon Enceladus harbors complex organic molecules, a study said Wednesday, offering further evidence that the small world could have all the right ingredients to host extraterrestrial life.",
      "Just 310 miles wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the sun.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the sun \u2014 and therefore too cold \u2014 to be habitable.",
      "Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon's miles-thick layer of ice.",
      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",
      "So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.",
      "Luckily, they already had access to some.",
      "When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon's surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at around 11 miles a second.",
      "But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\"Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,\" Klenner told the AP in an email.",
      "\"Another piece of the puzzle\"",
      "Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that \"the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn's E ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus's ocean.\"",
      "French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was \"not much doubt\" that these molecules were in the moon's ocean.",
      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",
      "Khawaja added that \"even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.\"",
      "NASA has a spacecraft en route to another enticing target to hunt for the ingredients of life: Jupiter's moon Europa. The Europa Clipper is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in 2030 with dozens of Europa flybys. ESA also has a spacecraft, Juice, that's headed to Jupiter to explore Europa and two other icy moons that could hold buried oceans.",
      "Underground oceans on moons \"are perhaps the best candidates for the emergence of extraterrestrial life in our solar system. This work only confirms the need for further studies,\" University of Kent physics professor Nigel Mason, who was not involved in the latest findings, told the AP.",

      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",

      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",

    "story": [
      "At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, a test bed for a new kind of air force, Major Trent McMullen is a fighter pilot learning to fly alongside the XQ-58, a drone piloted by artificial intelligence. Think of this as \"Top Gun AI.\"",
      "\"I've flown safety chase on it for several missions, messaging back and forth with the autonomy on board,\" said McMullen.",
      "Maneuvering alongside an AI-piloted drone, he said, takes a bit of getting used to: \"As humans, we fly very smooth, but it can roll and fly a little bit snappier than maybe a human pilot would,\" McMullen acknowledged. \"It could be a little bit rougher a ride, but there's no human on board.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is on board, and now it is learning how to fight.",
      "McMullen said the tasks assigned to AI might be to intercept an adversary aircraft: \"So, we've been able to give it some of the basic blocking and tackling of air combat that we as human pilots also train on when we're first learning how to fly,\" he said.",
      "The XQ-58 blasts off like a rocket, but a full-scale model took off from a runway for the first time in August.",
      "General Adrian Spain, head of Air Combat Command, is drawing up plans for operating AI-piloted drones alongside manned aircraft. \"You've told them to go out in front and to execute an attack on a complex set of targets, and they will do that,\" Spain said.",
      "He says AI drones are capable of doing that today \u2013 and those drones could be armed with weapons.",
      "An AI-piloted F-16 has already held its own in a limited dogfight against an experienced fighter pilot. At Top Gun AI, other F-16s are being rewired for more realistic combat. Those aircraft still have a cockpit, and a pilot, who can engage the plug-and-play AI system, and then remain on board as a safety pilot.",
      "\"So, once the AI goes on, the hands come off?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yep, they'll be monitoring the system and ready to take over at a moment's notice,\" McMullen said. \"But we'll also have real live aircraft out there for it to fight against. Those jets will be piloted by real fighter pilots trying their best to outsmart the AI.\"",
      "So, are we witnessing a revolution?",
      "\"If we continue down this path, it has the potential to be a revolution,\" said Spain.",
      "\"You actually can take more risk\"",
      "Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"",
      "Change because the Chinese air force, which recently \u00a0showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",

It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-artificial-intelligence-work-trade-jobs/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:28:17 -0400",
    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT,\u00a0announced\u00a0new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program.",
      "All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.",
      "The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize the safety of ChatGPT for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",
      "\"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time,\" the company said. \"We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family.\"",

Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",

But they have said that they agree with the president's framework for the release of the hostages. So what those talks should be about \u2013 and some of that conversation is already happening now - - it's not waiting until Monday in Cairo \u2013 is the logistics behind the release of these hostages.",

That's what should be \u2013 that's what this conversation should be about at this point, because they've agreed to the framework of it.",
      "Then there's second \u2013 beyond that is, what happens after that? And that is, how do we ensure that we can create a \u2013 and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas? And that's going to take work and some time, not just to agree on, but to implement.",
      "But that's important, because that's what's going to bring a permanent end to these hostilities in the long term. And so those are the two phases here. But, right now, the most emergent and immediate phase is the one that Hamas claims to have agreed to already, and that is, they are prepared to release the hostages.",
      "Let's discuss through the mediators the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens. And that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So my sources have indicated to me that, because the upper echelon of Hamas fighters has been so decimated, communication is difficult. The other terror groups who also hold hostages in Gaza aren't necessarily easily controlled by them.",
      "How do you manage around this reality? And is full release by October 7 the demand?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I don't know about the date. It would be great if it was before October 7. We wish it would have happened yesterday.",
      "But there are realities here, and then there are things people do to impede progress. Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that suffered a tremendous amount of destruction. That fighting needs to stop. You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on.",
      "But, at the same time, that can't \u2013 you know, so that has to end, but \u2013 that has to stop. But you also have to work through the other logistics. Who's going to go pick them up? We saw how this happened in the past. You know, the Red Cross would go in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They would be handed over through this process, et cetera. And so all of that's what has to be worked on and is being worked on as we speak.",
      "So I'm not telling you there aren't some logistical hurdles here, but I am saying that the expectation is, is that this happens quickly. And I would also say that, while we want all the hostages to be released, if there are five that are ready to go right now, they should be released right now. If another 10 are ready to go in 12 hours after that, the next group should come out, but, ultimately, they should all come out.",
      "And I think what you're hearing from people is, yes, there has to be some logistics that have to be worked through. But what you can't have and what we can't see and what we hope we will not see is that we get into these talks, and these talks are then delayed, and it looks like they're unnecessarily delaying it.",
      "That would be a very bad sign. Let's hope that's not what happens. And it's going to be very important for our partners in the region who signed on to this deal, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, et cetera, for them to be putting a lot of pressure on Hamas to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you pointed out that releases can't happen when bombardments are underway.",

      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think, ultimately, what you're going to see here is that, when an agreement is reached on these are the logistics behind when the release is going to happen, then I think you'll see those bombardments stop.",
      "And I think some of that activity has already decreased somewhat. So, there's a framework here, and the framework is simple. Once you agree on the logistics of how this is going to happen \u2013 I think the Israelis and everyone acknowledge you can't release hostages in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop, and, as you saw, the president state that very clearly on Friday, where he want \u2013 asked the Israelis to begin to pull back to create the conditions for these releases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is not a violation of that?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, look, there's going to be a lot of complexities.",
      "Well, we're trying to get the hostages out. That's the bottom line. We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible. For that to happen, there can't be a war going on in the middle of it, and Hamas has to agree to turn them over and we have to have the right people go in and get them. That's what we're going to focus on right now, and that's what we're going to \u2013 that's what we've been focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And that's what the talks are going to be about today, on Monday, on Tuesday, to get this done as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you. There are two phases here, with \u2013 Hamas releasing the hostages is the one you're most focused on. But, big picture, does the United States assess that Israel has so reduced the threat posed by Hamas that it can end combat and transition to the kind of lower tempo counterterrorism campaign that, say, the United States carries out against terrorist threats to this country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, look, I mean, the ideal outcome here is, you don't have to carry out any counterterror missions because there are no terrorists in Gaza because Gaza is governed by Palestinian technocrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can they take the win? Can Netanyahu say he won this war?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, that \u2013 creating a Gaza \u2013 or setting up a Gaza that is governed by Palestinian technocrats that are not terrorists and are not sponsoring terrorism, that's not going to happen in 72 hours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's going to take some time to build up, and it's going to require a lot of work and a lot of international support.",
      "And that's the end goal here of this entire endeavor, after you get the hostages out. By the way, if you can't get the hostages out, you have no hope of getting that done. So that's why I say, you know, that that \u2013 these two steps need to happen.",
      "But it's going to take a lot of hard work and time. You know, you're trying to build something that doesn't exist right now, which is a sort of civilian Palestinian leadership that's not tied to terrorism. That doesn't exist right now. It's going to take a lot of help from international partners.",
      "That's why having the countries in the region and the Europeans and all others involved in this in both money and resources, that's why building that coalition is so critical. And then implementing it is not going to be easy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's going to take some time here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But I think, certainly, for the first time in a long time, you see the framework and the outlines of something that could work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But combat operations can end?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's the goal here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, you wouldn't need combat operations if there weren't terrorists there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But, by the same token, I would remind everybody, if, in fact, at the end of all this terrorism and a terrorist group remains active inside of Gaza, you're not going to have peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's the fundamental truth here that everyone needs to accept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You're never going to have peace in Gaza as long as there are terrorists operating from that territory threatening the security of Israel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But in terms of occupation and combat operations, that's different than a counterterrorism campaign.",
      "But let me ask you specifically what President Trump said. He told Barak Ravid of Axios that Prime Minister Netanyahu \u2013 quote \u2013 \"took it very far, and Israel lost a lot of support in the world. Now I'm going to get all that support back.\"",
      "At what point did President Trump decide that Netanyahu took this fight in Gaza or his operations throughout the Middle East, when did he take it too far?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think the president's \u2013 OK, the president's observation, basically, is that because of the length of this war and how it's gone \u2013 we've all seen the international narrative.",
      "We've all seen it. Whether we agree with it or not, we have seen countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and others come out and sort of signal support for \u2013 or announce support for a Palestinian state. We have seen, even in our own domestic politics, some of the attacks on Israel.",
      "We don't forget what happened on October 7.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's the other thing the president repeatedly points to, is, remember October 7.",
      "But the implic \u2013 whether we agree with it or not, we have seen the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. And I think that's the point the president is making here, is that, whether you believe it was justified or not, right or not, that we \u2013 you cannot ignore the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing.",
      "That said, if we never want to see this happen again, meaning a war like this, you can never have another October 7 or anything like it ever happen again. And that's the thing the president has reiterated and repeatedly made clear to our partners in the region, and that is, if you truly want peace and stability and a better future for the Palestinian people, then there has to be a Gaza that is not governed or controlled in any way, shape or form by Hamas or anything that looks like Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Does the United States support a Palestinian state? Because point 19 in your White House plan talks about a credible pathway to Palestinian self- determination and statehood.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, we've always said \u2013 I mean, this has been a consistent position throughout \u2013 that the only way you're ever going to have anything that looks like statehood is in a negotiated deal with the Israelis. We are so far from that right now.",
      "A pathway means, yes, you're going to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Prime Minister Netanyahu opposes\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 a Palestinian state and thanked President Trump for speaking against recognition of one. That's why I'm asking you to clarify.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, we haven't recognized a Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States has not. And, right now, there's no point in doing that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the U.S. want to see one?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 because it's not even possible. That's not even a realistic thing right now, because who \u2013 who would govern that Palestinian state, Hamas?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's point 19 in your plan\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who would govern it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 I thought.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, but that's talking about a pathway long term and in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But one of the \u2013 before you can even get there, OK, that's \u2013 you know, before you can even get there, you have to have someone to turn that land \u2013 Israel's made clear they have no interest in governing Gaza, they have no interest in occupying Gaza long term and being the government of Gaza.",
      "I think Israel \u2013 I can't speak for Israel, but I think Israel would tell you they would love to turn over Gaza to a Palestinian organization that isn't terroristic. They would love to do that. But that doesn't exist right now. That has to be built, and that's going to take time.",
      "You're not going to build that in 72 hours. You're not going to build that in 72 weeks. I mean, it's going to take some time to get to that point. So that's the pathway this discusses. And I think, if you look forward into the future, where there is suddenly a Palestinian government-like organization that can govern territory, then there's a lot of possibilities.",
      "But that has to be negotiated and agreed to by Israel. In the end, it's very simple. There can be peace in Gaza. There can be Palestinian governance in Gaza, whether you call it statehood or something else, as long as it is not terrorists that are in charge of that territory.",
      "That's what Israel agreed to when they turned over Gaza in the first place, and then Hamas took over Gaza and turned it into a terrorist camp, and that's what's led us to the point that we are at today. So if we can get off that road and onto a different road, there are a lot of possibilities long term and in the future, but right now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So maybe?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 we are far from that. Right now, we \u2013 we need to get these hostages out, and we just need technocrats that are not terrorists to be able to begin the basic reconstruction of Gaza.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): There's not, Margaret.",
      "Good morning. Good to hear your voice.",
      "It's kind of quiet around here. It has been for the last several days, and it's very unfortunate, because, as we're talking, real people are being adversely affected around the country, and some in \u2013 in very substantial ways.",
      "I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government, I surely hope that they will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did send your lawmakers home to their districts, which suggests we've got probably another week ahead of us of this shutdown.",
      "You mentioned the real-world impact. Federal workers, including our military, would miss their first paychecks October 15 or 16. How long should workers plan to be without that income?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, the only person who can answer that question is your next guest. And that's Chuck Schumer, because the House did its job. The reason that House Republicans are home working in their districts, and I suspect House Democrats should be as well, is because we did that.",
      "We passed a bipartisan, very clean continuing resolution a couple of weeks back now, and sent it to the Senate. It's very important to note what was in that. It was only 24 pages in length, Margaret. It was a good faith effort to keep the government open for seven more weeks so that Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion, could work together to fund the government with the appropriations process.",
      "Chuck Schumer always voted for those in the past. In fact, he did it 13 times during the four years of the Biden administration, but now suddenly he's commanding his Democrats in the Senate not to do it. And there's one simple reason why. They need political cover from the far left corner of the base.",
      "He's afraid, Chuck Schumer individually \u2013 ask him about it \u2013 he's afraid he's going to get a challenge from the Marxist left in his party, because that's the new wave in New York. That's what this is about. Chuck Schumer is trying to show a fight against the president and Republicans, and real Americans are being harmed in the process of this political game.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, Democrats, as you know, want to have another conversation in regard to extending some tax subsidies that lower the cost of some health care that's purchased through the Obamacare market.",
      "To that point, though, you're talking about the politics of this. Our CBS polling that we released today shows neither party's stance is viewed as worth shutting down this government.",
      "The Democrats want to talk about the tax credits. You know premium pricing is already being set now, even if this doesn't expire until end of the year. Your fellow Republican Jen Kiggans said: \"Raising costs for families with little notice and potentially stripping them of access to care is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "Doesn't she have a point here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: There's a lot of points to be made on that, and we're ready to talk about, negotiate and do all of that.",
      "But they're trying to create that as a red herring here right now. Margaret, this is a funding bootstrap measure, a very simple, very conventional thing that's been done here all the time. This is the way it works now. We need a little more time on the clock to finish the appropriations process. We have plenty of time to debate that very complicated issue.",
      "It's not a simple one. There has to be reforms to that subsidy, because there's a lot of fraud, waste and abuse involved in it. There's a \u2013 there's 535 members of Congress in the House and Senate. There's a \u2013 there's probably 400 different ideas on how to fix that.",

We're talking about a September 30 deadline that's now passed to keep the government open so that Republicans and Democrats can have that very debate.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, nor \u2013 neither does the president. No, the president wants the government open. He's pleaded with Schumer and Hakeem in person in his office to do that, and they said no, because they want to do this.",

      "I want to pick up on something the speaker of the House was pointing to. He wants this fight to be about illegals, as he said. And I want to be specific here because we know from our research that there is no federal money that goes towards health care tax credits for undocumented immigrants in this country. The federal government doesn't fund health insurance for the undocumented. But it is also true that states, like yours, New York, does provide health care for people who are in this country illegally. And their argument seems to be the money here is fundable and bottom line is it comes out of the federal pocket. Do you want to respond to that?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): You know, they don't want to \u2013 Johnson doesn't want to discuss the real issue, the health care crisis facing the American people, so he puts up all these fake lies to try and divert attention. It's his standard operation. He's just is concerned with the politics.",
      "Every independent agency that looks at this says Johnson's claim is false. And just as you said, Margaret, no, zero federal dollars can go to undocumented immigrants through Medicare, Medicaid, through ACA. And so, we ought to be talking about the real issue here, which is that we have a health care crisis in America, caused by the Republicans. They've \u2013 they've barreled us towards a shutdown because they don't want to deal with that crisis, plain and simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about the shutdown in a moment. In terms of health care, where you \u2013 you've taken us in terms of the messaging, Democrats, as I understand it, are looking for an extension of those Obamacare tax credit. I believe you'd like them permanently. You heard the speaker say, we can talk about that after the government is reopened, perhaps not permanently. But do you hear any kind of opening here for a negotiation whatsoever?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, right now, not. Look, Johnson's not serious about this. He sent his \u2013 all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How you going to negotiate when they're all there.",

If you're going to negotiate any agreement, you need Johnson, Thune, Trump, Schumer, and Jeffries. And the reason he sent them home is because he's more interested in protecting the Epstein files than protecting the American people from the health care crisis.",

Two days ago, starting October 1st, millions of Americans are getting notices that their health care premiums are going \u2013 dramatically increasing. If you're a 55-year-old couple and you pay \u2013 make $80,000, you know how much your premiums will go up if we don't extend it? It will go up something like $25,000.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, do you trust Leader Thune? And \u2013 and when you look at just your numbers here, three senators already crossed over to vote with Republicans on this short-term funding deal. Are you concerned about more defections?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Look, it's a Republican shutdown because they have refused to talk with us. Johnson, I saw him mentioned that we did it 13 times when I was majority leader. That's true. You know why? In every case we sat down and talked with the Republicans, and there was a give and take, and then both sides didn't get everything they wanted, but we got it done. They have refused to talk to us even once. And Jeffries and I have been trying to get them to talk to us for \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Thune \u2013 Thune told Fox that there are ongoing \u2013",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: They've tried to get to \u2013 us to talk to them for \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ongoing conversations.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: We've tried to talk to them for months and months and months and they said, no. The American people know that they're in charge. Republican president, Republican Senate, Republican House, that they have a responsibility to governor, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But back to the question of defections. Leader Thune was on another network, on Fox, and he said there are conversations with Democrats who want to find an offramp here. Is he having conversations with Democrats other than you? Are you sure you can't \u2013 will you have defections?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: I've \u2013 I've encouraged my \u2013 yes, Margaret, I've encouraged my Democratic members to sit and talk to Republicans. It's always good when Democrats and Republicans talk to each other.",
      "But two points. First, in those conversations, the Republicans offered nothing. And \u2013 but second, the only way this will ultimately be solved is if five people sit together in a room and solve it. They are the president, who also doesn't seem serious about this. You know, he's putting out his memes and his things with the grim reaper and all of that stuff, and he's playing golf.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Johnson's not serious. And so, we've got to sit down, the five of us. That's the way to solve this problem. But when Democrats talk to Republicans, it's a good thing. And I've encouraged my Democrats to do it, but they've offered us nothing. No change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you tried calling President Trump? He seems to take phone calls directly.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, you know, we sat \u2013 we tried to get President Trump to sit down with us weeks ago, long before the shutdown date started.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no. OK.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: He said \u2013 he said, yes. He said, no. Johnson told him to say no. We sat down the \u2013 you know, the day before, and he wasn't serious. He put these red hats on the table, and he's joking around. And honestly, in the meeting, Margaret, I got the feeling he didn't even know what was happening, that the crisis was impending, that people would pay such a \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: He once said, they're going to pay all that? That would be bad for me.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: The American people are hearing what's happening, and they are demanding that we address this crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: They are demanding we sit down together and do it. It's just logical. They are \u2013 say that, you know, in your survey that you put out \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: They say that 75 percent of people feel Trump isn't doing enough. Another survey by \"The Washington Post\" showed not only did 80 percent of the American people want us to extend these credits, but 55 percent of Trump voters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, our \u2013 our \u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I have to ask you about what the president announced yesterday in regard to federalizing 300 National Guardsmen out in the state of Illinois. We've heard this threat going back all the way to August. The governor says these are not needed. Do you have any idea when they'll arrive?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I believe they're going to be Illinois national guardsmen, so they're not going to be coming from out of state. I spoke to our governor yesterday, and it looks like it's going to be about 300 Illinois guardsmen who will be activated against the governor's wishes. So, they'll be \u2013 they'll be homegrown Illinoisans. And they're our brothers and sisters, our neighbors. I probably served with quite a number of them, certainly the leadership, and, you know, they'll be home. We'll \u2013 we'll welcome them.",
      "It's a misuse of the National Guard. They're \u2013 they're not needed in this particular role. If President Trump really wanted to fight crime, then maybe he should stop defunding the police. He, you know, he diverted $800 million in crime prevention efforts away from \u2013 that was appropriated away from funding for our police officers. So, you know, I \u2013 I \u2013 they're not needed, but we're going to welcome them because they're our brothers and sisters, and we're proud of our National Guard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He has surged \u2013 or the federal government has surged agents from different groups. The FBI said yesterday they're sending folks in. Tell me about these protests. Because the \u2013 the images look pretty intense of what has happened in \u2013 between people on the streets of Chicago \u2013 we're showing some of that video now \u2013 around immigration issues. As I understand, yesterday, ICE authorities shot a Chicago woman in the Brighton Park area. Secretary Noem claimed ICE fired defensive shots at this woman, who was armed who had appeared in a border patrol intelligence bulletin previously. She claims that federal agents were surrounded and were threatened. What are local authorities telling you about what they think happened here?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, they lie, right? The Trump administration lies. We have a president who's a known liar. And they have been \u2013 they have been lying about the situation all along. And, in fact, they even shot tear grenades \u2013 tear gas grenades, I think, at a reporter who was simply driving by with her window open. And so, we are \u2013 we're urging people, we're urging our protesters, remain calm, peaceful protests, exercise your First Amendment rights, but videotape everything. Everybody has a phone. Tape everything so that we actually have real evidence of what is happening.",
      "We know the Trump administration lies consistently. And what I am hearing is that, for the large part, people are being very quite \u2013 are being very respectful, but ICE is being very aggressive. Remember that they are zip- tieing children. They are raiding apartment blocks in the middle of the night, separating children from their families, pulling people out on to the streets naked. They are using Gestapo tactics in Chicago. And this is what Trump wants to, right? He wants to intimidate the people of Chicago. That's not going to happen. And we're going to document everything and make sure, just as the judge in Portland said that these \u2013 these requirements, these orders from the Trump administration are not actually tied to reality.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about President Trump's directive to send Oregon National Guard troops into Portland, and the judge said that \u2013 untethered to the facts.",
      "But in this case, I mean the Homeland Security adviser says, \"there's a large and growing movement of left wing terrorism organized and funded.\" They're posting on Homeland Security images of snipers. So, we're not talking troops, we're talking about federal agents that are carrying out some of this right now. Have you seen any evidence of \u2013 of what Stephen Miller is describing here in terms of organization and targeting of federal agents?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: No, not at all. This is \u2013 it's simply not happening. They are lying. And so, if anybody is targeting anyone, it is out of control ICE agents targeting, again, zip-tieing children, throwing reporters onto the ground, separating children from their mothers, trying to convince schools to turn over kids from public schools. They are raging through the streets of Chicago trying to intimidate everyday, ordinary citizens who are just trying to go to school and go to work. That's not \u2013 that's not what America is about. And it is shameful that the president of the United States has instigated this in one of its greatest cities. He should be defending the city. He should be protecting the city. Send us the federal dollars that were appropriated in a bipartisan way to support law enforcement. They took money away from law enforcement officers, child prevention effort \u2013 violence against children prevention efforts. They \u2013 they've literally \u2013 this president has defunded the police.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is counter, their message at least. But on the message around the military, I want to ask you about what happened at Quantico and just \u2013 so our viewers are clear, you serve on Armed Services, but you retired from the National Guard. You were a lieutenant colonel.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Twenty-three years. Proud of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Black Hawk helicopter pilot in Iraq. You served in combat. Secretary Hegseth told senior military leaders just a few days ago, he doesn't want to prevent women from serving, but he's now going to require everyone meet the male standard.",
      "Let's listen to that.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, SECRETARY OF WAR: When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral. If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How did you hear those remarks? And how do you think female service people heard them?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, this is the least qualified secretary of defense in our nation's history. And he's questioning the ability of the women who actually qualified to do their \u2013 to do their jobs. The female rangers, the female that graduated from SEAL school have met those highest standards. And by the way, he \u2013 he is obfuscating a little bit because there are different male standards. The standard for a 45-year-old man is not the same as an 18-year-old man. So, he doesn't actually talk about that. He has long sought to push women out of the military. And, frankly, our military could not do its job of protecting America and keeping us safe without the women who serve in the military.",
      "If you look at some lessons we learned in Afghanistan, for example, the lionesses, the Marine Corps group of women who actually went on patrol, all female units, that actually was able to get intelligence from women, Afghani women, to get information on the enemy. Frankly, you've got the least qualified secretary of defense in the nation's history who wastes taxpayer dollars on a regular basis doing things like bringing in general and flag officers to be an audience for his dog and pony show, using them as little toy soldiers, when they should be out there, at their units, in command, doing their jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for very time and for your insight.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the former commanding general of the U.S. Army in Europe, retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. And he joins us from Germany.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick \u2013 pick up where we left off with Senator Duckworth, who is a Purple Heart recipient for her time serving this country in combat.",
      "Men and women have different basic fitness standards. The secretary, in his remarks at Quantico, said women \u2013 or he suggested women were being given a pass or were held to lower standards for fitness requirements. Do you think his change to the, quote/unquote, \"male standard\" is necessary?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: I think this is completely unnecessary. I have 38 years in the Army, and we've served with women in all sorts of different environments and deployments. And I never had a case where a female soldier was not able to do what she had to do. So, this is a \u2013 seems to me an unnecessary, almost a medieval approach that doesn't reflect the requirements that we have for women and men who are intelligent, able to operate in a modern battlefield environment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The defense secretary made these remarks at Quantico last week, as you well know, ordered in our most senior military officers to hear him lay out what he talked about in terms of changing rules of engagement. Those, you know, codes of conduct and standards, to make war less brutal. The secretary said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, SECRETARY OF WAR: We also don't fight with stupid rules of engagement. We untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt, and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for war fighters.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of \u2013 of those directives to officers?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, that's \u2013 that's not going to help anybody accomplish their mission. I mean when you think about the mission that we had in Afghanistan, for example, and I think that's where some of his experience comes from, it was to protect Afghan civilians so that they could reestablish government and secure themselves. And so it was not about how many Taliban could you kill. We had already tried that, and that didn't work.",
      "So, the rules of engagement are not politically correct. They're not intended to make it harder for soldiers or units to do their job. They actually are part of the mission. Why are we there? And so, I don't have any experience where killing a lot of innocent people, or violating the Geneva Convention, is going to help accomplish the mission.",
      "I think that the idea that we should \u2013 that somehow it's going to make us better and more effective by people not having to worry about the law is going to be bad for us in the long-term as well, both psychologically for soldiers, but also the trust of the American people and of our allies in American forces, where we have always lived up to international law. And that was where a lot of the respect came from. We do not want to be like the Russian army, and they certainly don't worry about rules of engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Geneva Conventions are something that the secretary, as a private citizen, wrote about in his book and questioned whether they should be followed at all. He said, \"what if we treated the enemy the way they treated us? And if we\" \u2013 I mean he talked about al Qaeda and using some of their tactics, \"rip their arms off, feed them to the hogs.\" I mean, this sounds tough, but in terms of practice, does it risk the lives of \u2013 of those who are the trigger pullers, those who are on the ground, to have this message delivered from the highest levels?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, listen, first of all, the Geneva Conventions were constructed starting in 1949 after the Second World War. And they were intended to protect innocent people, helpless people, noncombatants from the ravages of war, as it did happen in the Second World War. And I don't think anybody would say that Dwight Eisenhower was woke. And here he was, he was chief of staff of the Army, and then supreme allied commander, and then president. So, this was during his time that the United States helped create and sign the Geneva Convention. So, here's a guy with more combat experience and wartime experience than almost anybody.",
      "Now, the \u2013 when you think about modern warfare, especially when you're counterterrorism, just as Secretary Rubio was describing earlier on your program, the people \u2013 how \u2013 how you deal with the enemy and how you deal with populations is how you defeat an insurgency. And killing everybody in sight is not how you defeat an insurgency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As defense secretary, Hegseth fired the top military lawyers who advise on lethality. Here's some of the advice he gave to senior leaders this week.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: You kill people and break things for a living.",
      "In this profession, you feel comfortable inside the violence so that our citizens can live peacefully. Lethality is our calling card and victory our only acceptable end state.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think that means?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, first of all, it's not connected to the reality of how these things happen, how wars are won. First of all, the political leadership has to describe the end state. What is \u2013 what is it we're going to do? Why are we sending troops somewhere? What are they supposed to accomplish? And usually it's not going to be by killing everybody in sight. So, I think \u2013 I think there's a disconnect between this idea that it's all about lethality and that we kill people and break things. That's \u2013 that's not the mantra of any Army unit I was ever in, in 38 years. It was always about, accomplish the mission that was assigned to us, carry out every lawful order, and do it in such a way that protects civilians and ensures that all of our soldiers are protected and come back home safe. This idea of break things and kill people, you know, that's what the Russians did in Bucha and Mariupol. That's not who we are. We're the soldiers of a free, democratic country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president also spoke at that gathering. He referred to \"the enemy within.\" He also spoke about using \"U.S. cities, like Chicago, as training grounds.\" Are \u2013 are you comfortable with people thinking that?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: Well, look, I think, first of all, U.S. military \u2013 our fellow citizens should be confident that the U.S. military will always carry out lawful orders. And so it's alarming when all of the Judge Advocate General, or the Army \u2013 or the military lawyers are sacked, are sent away because commanders do need to have legal counsel as they receive orders and they look at these complex situations. But our \u2013 our troops will carry out lawful orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL BEN HODGES: I guarantee you that no soldier wants to have to use force against American people.",

      "At a news conference Sunday afternoon, Montgomery Police Chief James Graboys identified those who died as 17-year-old Jeremiah Morris and 43-year-old Shalonda Williams. He said five of the injured were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries, and the remaining seven had injuries that weren't considered life-threatening. The youngest victim was 16 and seven altogether were younger than 20, Graboys said.",
      "Police were called around 11:30 p.m. to what Graboys described as a \"mass shooting.\"",
      "\"This was two parties involved that were basically shooting at each other in the middle of a crowd,\" Graboys told reporters.",

      "The shooting happened on a busy night in the city's tourist district, shortly after a football game between Tuskegee University and Morehouse College, said Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed.

      "Washington \u2014 Congressional leaders traded blame for the government shutdown on Sunday as the stalemate over how to reopen the government stretched into another week without progress on negotiations.",
      "The Senate is set to reconvene Monday after dueling measures to fund the government fell short of the necessary support for a fourth time on Friday, showing no sign of movement from either party. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson canceled plans for the lower chamber return to Washington this week in an effort to increase pressure on the Senate.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"the House did its job\" by passing a measure last month that would fund the government until Nov. 21, saying the reason House Republicans will remain in their districts this week is \"because we did that.\"",
      "\"I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government. I surely hope that they will,\" Johnson said.",
      "The House-passed measure first failed in the Senate on Sept. 19, with all but one Democrat opposing in favor of a separate measure to fund the government through October that also includes Democrats' health care priorities. Then, as the government was hours from shutting down last week, the Senate voted again on the measure, when two more senators crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans in favor. But support for the bill still remained shy of the 60-votes required in the Senate.",
      "Since then, Senate Republicans have been seeking to peel off Democratic support for their measure, while Democratic leaders have remained firm in their demand that a funding measure include an extension of health insurance tax credits. And in subsequent votes on Wednesday and Friday, Republicans were unable to pick up more support from Democrats on their bill.",
      "Johnson said Republicans are ready to negotiate on the health insurance tax credits, but he said it's a complicated issue that will take time to address, pointing to possible reforms aimed at weeding out \"a lot of fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "\"We're not saying that we won't negotiate it,\" Johnson said. \"We're saying turn the lights back on in Congress.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" argued that Johnson is \"not serious\" about negotiating the health care issue, pointing to his move to keep the House away from Washington this week. And the New York Democrat urged that the only way the funding impasse will be resolved is with a meeting between congressional leaders and the president.",
      "\"We've been trying for months and months to sit down with them and have a serious conversation addressing America's healthcare needs, and they've refused and refused and refused,\" Schumer said.",
      "Schumer and Johnson, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, met with President Trump last week. But the meeting failed to produce an agreement to avert a shutdown ahead of the deadline. Schumer said Sunday that Mr. Trump \"wasn't serious\" in the meeting, after which the president posted what appeared to be an AI-generated video mocking the Democratic leaders.",
      "\"The American people know that they're in charge \u2014 Republican president, Republican Senate, Republican House \u2014 that they have a responsibility to govern, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs,\" Schumer said.",

      "Detective Devin Rigo knew the clock was ticking as he raced to a metal scrapyard just north of Portland, Oregon. Rigo, with the Hillsboro Police Department, had just learned about the discovery of a maroon minivan he believed contained evidence connected to the murder of 56-year-old Kenneth \"Kenny\" Fandrich, a contract pipe fitter.",
      "On Jan. 27, 2023, Kenny Fandrich was discovered in a parking garage at the Intel campus in Hillsboro. Police reviewed surveillance camera images and determined that Fandrich had been dragged into the minivan by a masked man. Police believed the killer had broken Fandrich's neck and killed him inside the minivan, before staging his body back in the driver's seat of his own vehicle.",
      "From evidence found at the scene, investigators believed the murder suspect tried to cover his crime by spray-painting multiple security cameras in the parking garage with blue spray paint. Correspondent Natalie Morales covers the investigation into Kenny Fandrich's murder and the hunt for the killer in \"Murder in the Parking Garage,\"\u00a0now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Soon after police arrived on the scene, Intel security personnel provided investigators with recordings from their hundreds of security cameras in the parking garage. Police soon had images of a suspect \u2013 wearing a hard hat, tinted glasses and a face mask \u2013 spray-painting the security cameras around Fandrich's car early that morning, to apparently conceal the crime. At the time, the suspect had not been detected by Intel. But when police looked at the footage, they discovered that the spray paint didn't cover everything the cameras recorded.",
      "Police believed that whoever had killed Fandrich waited for him inside that minivan, then attacked Fandrich when he returned to his car after his shift. The killer left the garage in the maroon minivan soon after.",
      "The night that Fandrich's body was found, his wife, Tanya Fandrich, told investigators Kenny had a stalker: a well-off former veterinarian named Dr. Steven Milner. Tanya Fandrich had worked for Milner at his vet clinic for years, and they had an affair, which Tanya Fandrich said was long over. Police found that Kenny Fandrich had filed several orders for protection against Milner, and that Milner had been warned by Hillsboro police officers to stop following Kenny Fandrich. Just months before Kenny Fandrich's murder, Milner had been caught placing a tracking device on one of the Fandrichs' vehicles and was criminally charged. After several days of investigation, police arrested Milner and charged him with the murder of Kenny Fandrich.",
      "Once in custody, police were able to connect the minivan, and another vehicle, to Milner, who had left them at a Home Depot parking lot for long periods of time.",
      "To prove the case against Milner, investigators felt they had to find that minivan. \"Because it's the minivan that we believe was really our main crime scene \u2026\" said Rigo. \"We thought there was going to be forensic evidence \u2026 in that minivan.\"",
      "Rigo and his partner, Detective Stephanie Winter, called the vehicles \"burner cars.\"",
      "\"Everybody kind of is more familiar with like a burner phone \u2026\" said Rigo, \"where you have a phone that's not \u2026 traced to you but, you know, you can use it for what you need, get rid of it \u2026 Essentially, he did the same thing, but with a car.\"",
      "The maroon minivan had been flagged at the Home Depot parking lot and the VIN number had been recorded. Security footage showed the van leaving the Home Depot parking lot shortly before Fandrich was murdered.",
      "\"We are sending flyers to every agency in the area,\" said Rigo about the minivan's VIN number.",
      "The first alert they got was from the Oregon Department of Transportation. The minivan had been towed off the side of the busy I-5 highway in North Portland just days after Fandrich was murdered. Detectives believe it had been dumped there by Milner. Rigo called the tow company and found out the minivan had been sold to a scrap metal company. That's when he started racing to the scrapyard to see if they could retrieve the minivan, and the key crime scene evidence it may have held. But he was too late. When Rigo arrived and asked about the minivan, he was shown a video of the crime scene being picked up and smashed to pieces. \"I was able to watch one of my key pieces of evidence be crushed and taken away,\" said Rigo, \"before my very eyes \u2026 exactly a week too late.\"",

      "Maneuvering alongside an AI-piloted drone, he said, takes a bit of getting used to: \"As humans, we fly very smooth, but it can roll and fly a little bit snappier than maybe a human pilot would,\" McMullen acknowledged. \"It could be a little bit rougher a ride, but there's no human on board.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is on board, and now it is learning how to fight.",
      "McMullen said the tasks assigned to AI might be to intercept an adversary aircraft: \"So, we've been able to give it some of the basic blocking and tackling of air combat that we as human pilots also train on when we're first learning how to fly,\" he said.",
      "The XQ-58 blasts off like a rocket, but a full-scale model took off from a runway for the first time in August.",
      "General Adrian Spain, head of Air Combat Command, is drawing up plans for operating AI-piloted drones alongside manned aircraft. \"You've told them to go out in front and to execute an attack on a complex set of targets, and they will do that,\" Spain said.",
      "He says AI drones are capable of doing that today \u2013 and those drones could be armed with weapons.",
      "An AI-piloted F-16 has already held its own in a limited dogfight against an experienced fighter pilot. At Top Gun AI, other F-16s are being rewired for more realistic combat. Those aircraft still have a cockpit, and a pilot, who can engage the plug-and-play AI system, and then remain on board as a safety pilot.",
      "\"So, once the AI goes on, the hands come off?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yep, they'll be monitoring the system and ready to take over at a moment's notice,\" McMullen said. \"But we'll also have real live aircraft out there for it to fight against. Those jets will be piloted by real fighter pilots trying their best to outsmart the AI.\"",
      "So, are we witnessing a revolution?",
      "\"If we continue down this path, it has the potential to be a revolution,\" said Spain.",
      "\"You actually can take more risk\"",
      "Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"",
      "Change because the Chinese air force, which recently \u00a0showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

    "summary": "In city after city, the Trump administration has been testing limits of the law in apprehending and detaining people suspected of being undocumented, many of whom have no criminal record.",
    "story": [
      "It's 11:00 a.m. on a Sunday in the heart of Hollywood, and the service at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is just getting underway. It was worship via the web. The church itself was empty, just like during the pandemic, when parishioners feared catching COVID. Today it was empty because they fear being caught themselves.",
      "On June 6, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement descended on Ambiance Apparel, a clothing wholesaler in L.A.'s Fashion District. The pastor of St. Stephen's, Father Jaime Edwards Acton, whose congregation is about 80% Hispanic, got a frantic call: \"She said, 'They got 'em.' At first, I had no idea what she was talking about because I was not thinking about it,\" Acton said. \"Even with all the threats and the bravado and stuff, I was not thinking that it would happen directly to us.\"",
      "Thirteen members of his congregation were arrested that day. The Trump Administration no longer considers schools, hospitals and churches to be \"protected sensitive locations\" anymore. So, the following Sunday, Acton told his faithful to stay away.",
      "He says the decision to close the church was not made lightly: \"No, not at all, but I was trying to balance, could we do church in person knowing that a good portion of our community was too afraid to leave their homes? It wasn't even people that were undocumented. I have longtime parishioners that I know for sure are citizens and have been for a while that were afraid to leave. They were afraid to leave their homes.\"",
      "In Los Angeles, that fear turned to anger, and anger into violence. The raids were challenged in court for being indiscriminate and based on skin color, but ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the raids could continue.",
      "Since then, in city after city, the administration has been testing the court's limits, especially in Chicago. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said this past week, \"ICE is running around the Loop harassing people for not being White. Just a year ago, that was illegal in the United States. Now ICE is making it commonplace.\"",
      "Pritzker said Saturday\u00a0the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard. Pritzker said Mr. Trump gave him an ultimatum: \"Call up your troops, or we will.\"",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has long defended the ICE raids as only going after the \"worst of the worst.\"",
      "\"Nobody is getting swept up,\" Noem said on August 8. \"We're running targeted enforcement operations across the country.\"",
      "But as those operations increased, so have assaults on federal agents: a sniper attack on an ICE facility in Dallas; an ambush in Alvarado, Texas; a violent scuffle in San Francisco.",
      "And then there is Portland. Protests around the ICE headquarters there have sparked particular ire from President Donald Trump, who directed federal troops to be sent to what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called a \"war-ravaged city.\" [On Saturday a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Portland.]",
      "In fact, this past week, while addressing top military brass, the president suggested American cities could serve as \"training grounds\" for U.S. combat troops. \"It seems that the ones that are run by the radical left Democrats, what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And we're gonna straighten 'em out one by one. And this is gonna be a major part for some of the people in this room.\"",
      "\"This doesn't feel like protecting the homeland anymore\"",
      "That idea has some military commanders uneasy, and even civilians within ICE itself are finding themselves conflicted.",
      "As part of ICE's legal department, attorney Adam Boyd provided guidance related to how ICE officers performed their enforcement duties. \"I saw this push to find how can we accomplish the goal with anything that seems legal enough,\" he said. \"We're lumping people with no criminal history who have been here for a very long time with the 'worst of the worst.'",
      "\"There's no question we have threats in our country,\" Boyd said. \"That's why the State Department and Homeland Security and the FBI and all these agencies work together to keep people safe. This doesn't feel like protecting the homeland anymore. It feels like we're just hitting numbers and goals.\"",
      "Take the case of 20-year-old Dylan Contreras, who came into the U.S. from Venezuela under a Biden-era mobile app. Back in April, though, DHS began revoking the legal status of many of those who used that app to apply for asylum.",
      "While his case was pending, Contreras had been attending high school in the Bronx learning English, and working as a delivery driver, in order to get his mom, Raiza, and his two younger siblings \u2013 Helen, 10 and Caleb, 7 \u2013 out of a shelter.",
      "Last May, Contreras did what he was required to: he showed up for his court hearing in New York. His mother said they assumed it was just another routine hearing in the process. \"Yes, I didn't think anything bad would happen,\" she said through an interpreter. \"He wanted to enter legally; he didn't want to get into trouble. He did it the right way.\"",
      "As they left the courtroom, however, his mother says federal agents followed them into the elevator. \"Like, five people or something came at me and grabbed me, pushed me to the floor,\" she said. \"My son screamed, and they grabbed him, too, and put handcuffs on him.\"",
      "Contreras did not have a criminal record. \"Not at all, not at all,\" his mother said. \"Those who know him, know.\"",
      "His case for asylum was denied last month. Pending an appeal, Contreras will be deported, leaving his mother and his two young siblings behind. Raiza said she was \"Devastated, devastated, because I've always been with my children, and he's been my partner. He's always been more than a son, a friend, everything.\"",
      "The most recent ICE data shows those with no criminal record, like Contreras, now make up the bulk of those being arrested and detained.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, however, is quick to list the violent offenders who have been captured, and there are many.",
      "As for Adam Boyd? Back in May he resigned his position at ICE citing \"unforeseen circumstances.\"",
      "\"It was a difficult decision,\" he said. \"If you think something is wrong, then you have to recognize that.\"",
      "He's now working for a firm in Philadelphia defending those arrested by ICE, which is no small task. After passage of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the federal government.",
      "Fr. Jaimie Edwards Acton says the expansion of ICE should be seen as a warning: \"I would tell everybody who thinks that this would never happen to them, that it could happen to them,\" he said. \"And people need to be ready for it, and to think through the possible, you know, kind of responses to it.\"",
      "For Acton, that response is no more hiding. For any immigrant, legal or otherwise, this is the new reality.",
      "So, for those willing to come back, the St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is open again, with eyes out for ICE, while they pray for peace and understanding.",
      "I asked Acton, \"Does it feel a little like David versus Goliath, though?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Acton, \"but, you know, David won that one!\"",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Oct 2025 09:14:53 -0400",
    "summary": "Most states now have, or are considering, bans of cellphones in public schools. For a generation that grew up with smartphones, being without is a whole new world.",
    "story": [
      "Homecoming day at Jericho High School on New York's Long Island looked very different this year. Same big display of school spirit on the gym floor, but up in the stands, there were no cell phones at this pep rally, because this year students have to put them away for the whole school day, \"bell to bell.\"",
      "New York, along with most other states, has mandated cell phone restrictions in public schools. Other states are considering legislation, too \u2013 which means a whole new world for kids, nearly all of whom (from high school age on down) were born after the first iPhone hit the market.",
      "\"We always have our phones,\" said 17-year-old Sabrina Cruz. \"Now it's like, we can't even have our phones, so like, can we even remember this moment, like, ten years from now? \u00a0Sometimes I wish I had my phone.\"",
      "The fact is, smartphones carry much of their life stories.",
      "We spoke to several Jericho High students, who were about a month into the new no-phones policy.",
      "Senior Adam Cohen said, \"I'm having, in a sense, a little separation anxiety. Just a little bit. I can't have my mom in my pocket, can't have my dad in my pocket, can't have my friends in my pocket.\"",
      "Inconvenient, perhaps, but phones, if we even have to tell you, had, in the opinion of most high school teachers, become a \"major problem\" in the classroom. Social media was a game-changer, said Brian Cummings, co-principal at Jericho High. \"Students were relying on the cell phone for social interaction,\" he said. \"Students were using the cell phones in class when they should have been paying attention to their teachers.\"",
      "Now, it's the students, too, who say they were missing something when they had their phones in class.",
      "\"I honestly realized that this year a lot of the things are pretty interesting,\" said Sabrina. \"For example, like, I was never a big history person. I was always, like, on my phone because I was like, This is boring. But this year I'm like, Oh wow, this is actually really interesting because it relates with my world right now.\"",
      "Rayan Hasan, a 15-year-old sophomore, said, \"Without the phones now especially, like, class discussions, they're, like, a lot more engaging.\"",
      "At the University of Pennsylvania, the kind of school many Jericho families dream of, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel has gone even further \u2013 banning all technology in his classroom.",
      "Aren't college-age students already capable of paying attention? \"You would be surprised,\" Emanuel said. \"They're shopping, they're Instagramming, they're emailing, they're looking at the newspaper. And by the way, it's not just phones. It happens the same \u2013 I know this happens \u2013 with computers in the room, anything that has an internet link.\"",
      "And his students agree. Asked whether the premise of a technology ban implied students are not capable of regulating their use on their own, one young man, Kunal, replied, \"We're not.\"",
      "But should the technology ban go beyond cellphones? Asked if computers should be banned from classrooms as well, Adam replied, \"That's how we fall behind as a generation.\"",
      "Senior Cynthia Qian suggested, \"A similar argument that they might've had, like, maybe 50 years ago with calculators.\"",
      "In addition to calculators, parental protection (you might say over-protection) has become the norm. Cummings said there were calls from anxious Jericho parents: \"They were worried that they're not going to be able to be in contact with their students,\" he said. \"If a parent needs to reach a kid and there's an emergency, call us. We'll pull 'em out of class immediately.\"",
      "I asked Emanuel, \"Maybe the most compelling counterpoint is the idea that we live in dangerous times, and you need to be able to reach the outside world, and the outside world needs to be able to reach you at all times, for safety reasons?\"",
      "\"Let's solve the danger problem not by using phones,\" he replied. \"And a parent contacting a kid doesn't solve the danger problem, [it] just assuages the anxiety.\"",
      "As for the kids, they are still sorting out what a phone-free school day means for their social lives, like meeting up with friends, or making arrangements for lunch. \"We've only had the phone ban for, like, four weeks. I think we still need a little bit more time,\" said Cynthia.",
      "Adam said, \"My friends have, like, found this one gathering spot. So, in-between periods, if I can't find anyone, they're probably there.\"",
      "Sabrina said, \"At least for me, I usually just see my friends in the hallways. I'll be like, 'Oh, are you gonna be in the lunchroom this period?'\"",
      "In other words, they talk with each other.",
      "This kind of learning is also what makes their principal think the ban is working. \"You go into the cafeteria now, it's maybe twice as loud as it used to be \u2013 I'm not even exaggerating,\" he said. \"More kids are talking to each other. One of the most important things of high school is the students learning to become better versions of themselves and get well-rounded. And how can communication not be a big part of that?\"",
      "And, at the end of a phone-free day, when asked if life is better with no phones this year compared to last year, the students said yes.",
      "Fifteen-year-old Sonia Ngai said, \"I think I'm living more in the moment.\"",
      "Those moments are to be savored, they now realize, because while smartphones may go on forever, their last year of high school will not.",
      "\"A lot of sports teams, they had digital cameras and stuff like that,\" said Sonia. \"I took a bunch of photos with different people. It was more sentimental in a way to take it on the digital camera.\"",
      "\"It's like going back, like, years,\" Sabrina said, \"before we were ever born.\"",
      "\"Back in the day!\" said Adam.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amy-coney-barrett-harassment-death-threats-supreme-court-term-2025/",
    "published": "Sun, 05 Oct 2025 08:06:22 -0400",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said of the Supreme Court's emergency orders in the Trump cases, \"This isn't the final decision.\"",
    "story": [
      "Whenever Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived at an auditorium or a library or a university last month to discuss her new book, she encountered a familiar sight: protesters.",
      "They lined the streets, chanting and carrying signs. One wore a handmaid's costume, a symbol of oppression. Another was dressed as liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death in 2020 created a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Trump would fill with Barrett.",
      "For Barrett, protesters have become routine, another logistical wrinkle in her everyday life, much like the ones who regularly gather at her home outside Washington, D.C., where she lives with her husband and younger children. What surprises her, she told me in a wide-ranging interview in her chambers late last month, is how she can let it roll off her back.",
      "\"If I had imagined before I was on the Court, how I would react to knowing that I was being protested, that would have seemed like a big deal, like, 'oh, my gosh, I'm being protested,'\" she says. \"But now I have the ability to be like, 'Oh, okay, well, are the entrances blocked?' I just feel very businesslike about it. It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't disrupt my emotions.\"",
      "A fury of protests against conservative justices erupted in 2022, when news leaked that the Court was poised to overturn the landmark decision Roe v. Wade. Barrett, a conservative in the mold of her former mentor and boss Antonin Scalia, was a particular source of ire. Replacing Ginsburg, whose legal career was grounded in women's rights, she provided a key fifth vote to overturn Roe and let each state decide whether to allow abortion or not. But the decision also unleashed something much darker.",
      "On Friday, a California resident was sentenced to eight years in prison for the attempted assassination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who also voted to overturn Roe. Court papers revealed the perpetrator had also mapped out the homes of three other conservative justices, including Barrett's. Death threats have not gone away, and security remains high at their homes and whenever they appear in public.",
      "I asked Barrett if she is ever afraid. Her response was immediate and emphatic: \"I'm not afraid.\"",
      "\"You can't live your life in fear,\" she continued. \"And I think people who threaten \u2014 the goal is to cause fear. And I'm not afraid. I'm not going to reward threats with their intended reaction.\"",
      "That kind of mental discipline and self control, even in the face of threats and extreme criticism, reflects an outlook that has guided the 53-year-old Barrett much of her life.",
      "\"I don't make decisions emotionally. I try very hard not to let emotions guide decisions in any aspect of my life. The way that I respond to people, the choices that we make,\" she continues, adding with a laugh, \"apart from maybe some impulse buys of clothes or something.\"",
      "That outlook is also reflected in her approach to the law.",
      "On the Supreme Court, Barrett's opinions are highly analytical. She doesn't like to decide more than the issue at hand, which is one reason she has parted ways with conservative colleagues who would rather swing for the fences, like in a case two terms ago when the Court ruled states cannot remove Trump from the ballot. Barrett agreed on the bottom line, but had a more limited approach.",
      "As a former law professor, she can be formalistic and technical, qualities that also can separate her from other conservatives, as in a 2024 case that attempted to hold the Biden administration responsible for suppressing speech on social media during Covid.",
      "Now entering her sixth year on the Court, Barrett continues to defy stereotypes. Critics span the political spectrum, not only Democrats after she voted to overturn Roe, but more recently Republicans in the wake of decisions at odds with President Trump. She is \"confounding the Right and the Left,\" as the New York Times put it, raising hopes and fears on both sides.",
      "That's partly because, in decades past, some conservative justices have turned out to be anything but conservative. Would Barrett, too, go that route? And it's also in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the Court, reflecting an idea that the justices are mere political actors who should stay on their respective sides, regardless of the law.",
      "\"That is a notion that I try to disabuse people of in the book,\" she says.",
      "Correcting some of those public misperceptions that the Supreme Court is driven by politics or outcomes or is loyal to Trump is one of her main goals with her new book, \"Listening to the Law.\" She is part teacher, part tour guide, taking the reader inside the Court and highlighting some of its most controversial decisions to explain how the justices interpret the Constitution and the differences in conservative and liberal philosophies.",
      "And there is no case more controversial than the 5-4 decision overturning Roe, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Whole Health. Barrett uses it to explain how she and the Court's conservative majority interpret the Constitution with a method known as \"originalism,\" focusing on the Constitution's original meaning, the way the public understood it when it was adopted.",
      "In our interview, Barrett said she was drawn to originalism when she read Justice Scalia's opinions in a constitutional law class during her second year at Notre Dame Law School. She said she was frustrated after a first-year criminal law class, reading liberal decisions of the Warren Court and finding them to be \"unmoored.\" Scalia's opinions, with his originalist framework, made sense to her.",
      "\"I think I am different in style than Justice Scalia. I don't think I'm different in substance,\" she said. \"I think one thing that was important to Justice Scalia is fidelity to his analytical framework, so fidelity to textualism and originalism, even when it led to places that he didn't want to go.\"",
      "Scalia, for example, upheld flag burning as a First Amendment right, even though he said \"if I were king, I would not.\" With Barrett, an example is the death penalty. She upholds it as constitutional, even though it is at odds with her religious views.",
      "And that framework, she says, is how she approaches the cases involving Trump. While politicians, the media and the public are focused on the current occupant of the office, she says \"the Court has to take the long view.\"",
      "\"The way that we have to view cases is about the presidency, not about the president. We have to make a decision that's going to apply to six presidents from now, and that's how I try to view the law,\" she says. \"So in the same way that I do try to erase particular policies, or substitute in ones that I like or dislike \u2014 to try to maintain neutrality \u2014 I try to do that with the presidents too, because it can't turn on the president.\"",
      "Her critics aren't convinced, but Barrett seems unfazed by the attacks on her judgment or her character. In our conversation, and in multiple interviews with those who know her, she comes across as someone with a strong sense of self and an equally clear view on the right way to interpret the Constitution. Unlike some justices, she says she doesn't monitor what journalists and law professors and politicians say about the Court. She has seen them get it wrong. It doesn't matter to her.",
      "\"If I could have, especially as a 16-year-old, imagined that I would not care or be impervious to being criticized and mocked, I would have been very surprised,\" she says. \"And so I am glad, because I think this would be a miserable job if you let yourself care, if you let yourself be affected.\"",
      "Barrett first walked through the fire after Trump nominated her in 2017 to the Chicago-based federal appeals court. In her Senate hearings, she withstood withering attacks on her faith, notably when then-Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told her, \"the dogma lives loudly within you.\" Her steely performance impressed conservatives and helped get her on Trump's Supreme Court shortlist.",
      "Barrett was astonished by how she was portrayed by the media. (She said a cousin told her \"the person they were describing is not the person that I've known my whole life at all.\")",
      "A mother of seven, Barrett is a devout Catholic and proud daughter from a large and supportive family with deep roots in New Orleans. Before becoming an appeals court judge, she was a popular and respected Notre Dame law professor with sparkling credentials. Always a high achiever, she had received full scholarships to college and law school at Notre Dame, where she was top in her class (and met her future husband) and earned highly competitive clerkships with towering conservative icons, Judge Laurence Silberman and Scalia.",
      "\"One thing that I really disliked was this idea that I had no backbone, or that I was just this subservient woman in some way,\" she said, \"because I felt like I am anything but that.\"",
      "She had set goals for her life early on, and she made conscious and methodical choices to reach them. She wanted a big family like she grew up with, but, of course, she would work, so she wanted flexibility in her career.",
      "\"I really admired my parents, I really admired my grandparents, and I thought, if I want to be the kind of people that they are, I have to make definite choices,\" she told me. \"I have to decide what my values are, what my priorities are, and make definite choices and prioritize those kinds of things.\"",
      "Thinking about law school after college, she says she remembers sitting in her dorm room at Rhodes College and making a list of pros and cons, focusing on what mattered to her and \"I just reasoned my way to it.\" (Barrett, always analytical, mentions in her book that her life runs on to-do lists, but she also is partial to pro/con lists.)",
      "She's now the only justice on the Court who didn't attend an Ivy League school, but Barrett says she didn't care about labels or what was considered \"the best school.\" She didn't even apply to Harvard. She opted for Notre Dame over the University of Chicago, for instance, not only because she could prioritize her Catholic faith, but that it also offered a full scholarship. That meant no big student loans that would force her into an all-consuming, high-paying law firm job after graduation.",
      "Searching for a more accurate way to describe herself, Barrett uses the term \"Steel Magnolia.\"",
      "\"I've done a lot of traditionally feminine things. I have a large family. I've made unconventional choices in that way. And I'm not sorry to be feminine,\" she said. \"But I don't feel like I have to sacrifice that part. I think you can be traditional in some of those ways, and still have grit or the backbone or the spine. I felt like I had the grit.\"",
      "\"Grit\" is a word she uses more than once in the book when talking about strong women she admires, like her great-grandmother, a widow who raised 13 children in a tiny house \"bursting at the seams\" during the Great Depression. \"Somehow she always managed to find the resources, space and time,\" Barrett writes.",
      "Throughout our conversation, I'm struck by something she wrote early in the book, when she mentions advice her father gave to her and her siblings: \"Control your emotions, or your emotions will control you.\"",
      "It's similar to advice Justice Ginsburg liked to share from her mother: \"Don't be distracted by emotions like anger, envy, resentment. These just zap energy and waste time.\" Ginsburg would say her advice came in handy at the Court, because she learned that reacting with \"anger or annoyance will not advance one's ability to persuade.\"",
      "I asked Barrett if she, like Ginsburg, drew on that advice at the Court.",
      "\"Yes, in this job, I think it's part of the tuning out, that I can't let what people say\u2026certainly not affect the decisions that I make, but even affect how I feel,\" she says. \"If I let that in, and then let that affect my mood when I go home or when I'm relating to people, then that needs to be kept out.\"",
      "Having that mindset, Barrett says, is one of the things she's most proud of as justice, because that wasn't how she felt as a young teenager growing up in a family of nine.",
      "\"I felt very conspicuous. We would go into restaurants, and you could see people turning around and counting and looking,\" she says. \"In the preteen and teenage self-conscious years, I thought, I just want to be unnoticed. I'm never gonna have a family that attracts attention.\"",
      "Barrett rarely shows the kind of rhetorical fire or hyperbole some of her colleagues regularly exhibit. Stylistically, as she says, she is no Scalia. But with the Court increasingly under strain as it grapples with dozens of emergency requests from the Trump administration, Barrett exhibited a flash of pique last term, responding to a fiery dissent by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in the case limiting the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "Jackson, a Biden appointee and the Court's newest member, accused the Court of engaging in \"legalese.\" Barrett, speaking for the majority, responded: \"We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries with of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself.\"",
      "In the months since, Jackson has only ratcheted up her rhetoric as the Court has issued temporary orders in a range of cases brought by the Trump Administration. In one emergency order last month, on whether Trump could cancel grants to the National Institutes of Health, Jackson impugned the conservatives' motives.",
      "Jackson accused them of having \"no fixed rules\" except \"this Administration always wins\" something Barrett pointed out in an event last month was obviously false. (Just one high-profile example: The Court ruled against the Administration's deportation of Kilmar Albrego Garcia and ordered it to work toward his return to the U.S.)",
      "Still, Barrett insists that kind of language doesn't affect her relationship with Jackson, and that she works to have relationships with all the other justices. She says she enjoys talking about the law with Justice Elena Kagan, also a former law professor who, like Barrett has a more formalistic approach to the law than the Court's two other liberals, even though it leads them to very different places.",
      "In a recent interview, Bari Weiss of The Free Press asked Barrett to give one word for each of her colleagues. For Kagan, Barrett chose \"analytical.\" That's a word she also used in our conversation to describe herself.",
      "\"You can't take it personally, and so I think you just have to understand and see opinions for what they are: disagreements about ideas,\" Barrett said of the dissents. \"I intend my opinions to be about the ideas, not about the people, and I think a big part of life is assuming the best of other people.\"",
      "Barrett doesn't seem like a person who dwells in regret. But she said she saw a \"missed opportunity\" on her cross-country book tour, and she wished she'd emphasized how the emergency orders in the Trump cases are different. Always a teacher, she wants to explain these orders aren't the last word.",
      "\"I don't think the public is really aware this isn't the final decision. If a district court enters a preliminary injunction, and we enter a stay of that preliminary injunction, it's not saying the administration wins,\" she says. \"It's simply saying that the administration\u2026can continue to pursue whatever policy it is, because it has not been finally decided yet.\"",
      "In other words, she says, these interim orders \u2014 whether they're allowing Mr. Trump to cut grants or foreign aid or fire political appointees from federal agencies \u2014 are short-term, preliminary decisions. The Court is allowing Mr. Trump to pursue those policies for now, but if he ultimately loses on the underlying merits, the aid money will have to be spent and the employees reinstated with back pay.",
      "And Mr. Trump, I said, may not win them all?",
      "\"Right,\" Barrett said.",
      "It may look different, I asked, once you're deciding the merits?",
      "\"100 percent,\" she said.",
      "For now, one factor weighing in Mr. Trump's favor is the Court's assessment of the harm caused when unelected judges reflexively block policies enacted by popularly elected representatives. Because litigation can take years to resolve, those policies may never end up taking effect. The harm caused by judicial interference, the Court has explained, is to the democratic process.",
      "\"The case that we always cite is Maryland v. King, and it points out that any time a policy of one of the politically accountable branches or politically accountable state legislatures or governor is stopped, that, in itself, is an irreparable harm because you are affecting the people,\" she says. \"It was the people's preferred policy. The president is the one that they elected. The members of whatever legislature, state or Congress, are the ones that people elected.\"",
      "\"I may disagree, or agree, with whatever choices the people have made in the selection of their representatives,\" she said. \"But the people have made this choice.\"",
      "Beyond the obvious strain on the Court, the unprecedented crush of emergency appeals also has put pressure on lower court judges, and some have complained publicly that the Court's brief orders aren't giving them enough guidance. But Barrett, always methodical, says more guidance at the preliminary stage would come at a cost, raising the risk of locking the Court into its views before it has fully considered the issues.",
      "\"I do think opinions are important,\" she says. \"I don't know that it's always valuable to have an interim opinion that comes before the final opinion.\"",
      "Barrett, like all the justices when speaking in public, is exceedingly careful with her words. She won't discuss any upcoming issues or cases, or give any hint on how the Court may see the underlying merits. Even her book tour seemed like an exercise in not making news, and she succeeded.",
      "But she will have that opportunity soon enough: The justices already have agreed to decide whether Mr. Trump can impose far-ranging tariffs and fire members of certain federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. In the interim, it's allowing him to pursue tariffs and fire some Biden-appointed commissioners, though not on the Fed. Other cases, including birthright citizenship, are on the horizon.",
      "Beyond the Trump cases, the Court this term also will confront controversial cases on gun rights, voting rights, campaign finance reform and whether students who identify as transgender can play girls sports. The tensions and commentary will not ease anytime soon.",
      "For Barrett, that means staying the course, following her own internal compass and tuning out the noise, because one thing is certain. Whatever the Court decides in any of the cases, she says, \"somebody's going to be mad.\" It's a part of her life now.",
      "\"I just think you have to know who you are,\" she says, \"and make decisions that you decide are right, and stick with your priorities and not worry about the feedback you get from others, whether it's negative or whether it's positive.\"",

    "summary": "Rev. Yehiel Curry, 53, is only the fifth presiding bishop of the ELCA, a predominantly white denomination.",
    "story": [
      "The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is installing the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop on Saturday, a landmark moment for the predominantly white denomination.",
      "Curry succeeds the Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, who served for 12 years and was the first woman to lead the ELCA.",
      "A formal ceremony at Central Lutheran Church in Minneapolis kicks off Curry's six-year term, which began Oct. 1. He was elected at the ELCA Churchwide Assembly on July 30 in Phoenix.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that, if presence matters, me being here does something for allowing others to consider, 'Someone who looks like me, or is from my community, or speaks with an accent, or their mother tongue isn't English [could take on a similar role]',\" Curry\u00a0said in a statement when elected.",
      "American Lutheranism is often stereotyped by its Scandinavian and German roots and concentration in the upper Midwest. By some measures, the ELCA is more than 95% white. But it has invested in local congregations of color and multicultural ministries, while maintaining ties to growing Lutheran churches globally.",
      "\"He is representing a very white denomination as a Black man from the United States. I think it's a daunting, daunting call,\" said the Rev. Leila Ortiz, a friend who recently finished a term as ELCA bishop of the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., Synod. \"I trust him, and I trust God and I can't wait to watch.\"",
      "From social worker to reverend",
      "As the leader of the largest American Lutheran Church body, Curry will face challenges common to other mainline Protestant denominations, which in recent years have weathered theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion and precipitous membership declines. The ELCA has dropped from 5.3 million members in 1988 to 2.7 million members today.",
      "Since 2009, the ELCA has blessed same-sex marriages and welcomed LGBTQ+ clergy, elevating its first openly gay regional bishop in 2013 and its first openly transgender regional bishop in 2021.",
      "Curry, 53, is only the fifth presiding bishop of the ELCA, which formed from a merger of denominations in 1988. Until his election, he was one of 65 synodal, or regional, bishops. He led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod, where the ELCA's headquarters is also located.",
      "Born the seventh of 11 children on the south side of Chicago, Curry grew up Catholic\u00a0and attended Catholic schools through college. He was a social worker before becoming a public schoolteacher.",
      "When he and his wife first visited Shekinah Chapel, they were in their mid-twenties, and it was a fledgling congregation in Chicago. \"I never paid attention that it was in a Lutheran Church.\"",
      "The church had a mentoring program for young Black men and boys that he thought could serve some of his middle school students.",
      "\"I had these unique students,\" he said. \"And I was interested in services for them. \u2026 There was a worship service I stayed for. And I loved it.",
      "Shekinah Chapel grew from an ELCA program to an official congregation. Curry went from a lay leader to a more formal leadership role while going to seminary. He was ordained within the ELCA in 2009.",
      "\"That's uncommon where you get to lead in a place where you've been raised,\" Curry said. \"I now recognize how fortunate I am.\"",
      "He was part of the Theological Education for Emerging Ministries (TEEM) program, which the ELCA says prepares ministers in \"ethnic-specific, multicultural, rural and inner-city settings.\"",
      "New and diverse congregations",
      "His path to ministry highlights one way of growing new and diverse congregations within older church structures.",
      "Curry's forerunners as African American Lutheran leaders include the Rev. Nelson Wesley Trout, the first Black ELCA synod bishop, and the Rev. Will Herzfeld, a Black presiding bishop for a predecessor ELCA denomination.",
      "\"Blacks have been around the Lutheran Church since it presented itself in New Amsterdam in the 1600s. We have been present in some small way from the beginning,\" said the Rev. James Thomas, a retired ELCA seminary professor and author of \"A Rumor of Black Lutherans.\"",
      "Around the globe, the largest and fastest-growing Lutheran churches are in Africa.",
      "A benefit of Curry's leadership is that it can help elevate \"the fact that African Americans have been contributing to Lutheranism for a very long time, and not just here in the United States but around the world and in Africa,\" said the Rev. Yolanda Denson-Byers, who wrote \"See Me, Believe Me,\" a book on the challenges leaders of color face in the mainly white ELCA.",
      "Bishop Regina Hassanally of the ELCA Southeastern Minnesota Synod said Curry's elevation is a dual call - for him and the denomination.",
      "\"There can be a temptation to think that calling a leader of color is enough,\" she said. \"But the reality is that it means creating supports and infrastructure and actually allowing that person to lead out of all of their gifts and their full identity, not just one piece of their identity.\"",
      "Curry said his goals include exploring ways for the ELCA to be a more connected church, from local congregations up through the hierarchy. Along with being a welcoming and thriving church, it's one of the goals the denomination has already set.",
      "\"Sometimes you come up with these unique statements and strategies, but then we move on as transition happens,\" he said. \"I want to take something that we've affirmed already and maybe dig a little deeper.\"",

    "summary": "\"Let's discuss through the mediators the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens, and that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that the release of hostages from Gaza is the \"most emergent and immediate phase\" of the peace plan that President Trump outlined last week, which negotiators are set to discuss this week in Cairo.",
      "\"Let's discuss through the mediators the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens, and that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "On Friday, Hamas agreed to parts of the White House peace proposal, including the release of all the Israeli hostages, of which 20 are thought to be living, in exchange for 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazan detainees including women and children Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he has sent a delegation to Egypt \"to finalize technical details,\" outlining a goal to limit the negotiations to \"a time frame of a few days.\"",
      "U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, are expected to represent the U.S. at talks in Egypt on Monday. Rubio said conversations are underway ahead of Monday's meeting in Egypt, and he outlined that the talks should center on the logistics behind the release of the hostages.",
      "\"Beyond that is what happens after that, and that is, how do we ensure that we can create and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas,\" Rubio said. \"And that's going to take work and some time not just to agree on, but to implement.\"",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the plan last week, which called for Hamas to free all the remaining hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of Gaza in phases. The plan, backed by Netanyahu, also proposed handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" Palestinian committee, along with deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Hamas on Friday agreed to release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The proposal specifically called for the group to release within 72 hours of an agreement the remaining hostages who were taken on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "On the hostages, Rubio said the \"expectation is that this happens quickly,\" though he wasn't clear on a specific deadline. He acknowledged that there are some logistical hurdles, including Israeli bombardment.",
      "\"Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that's suffered a tremendous amount of destruction. That fighting needs to stop,\" Rubio said. \"You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on.\"",
      "CBS News team members on the ground in Gaza reported that there were Israeli bombardments underway, including strikes Saturday. Rubio outlined that he expects when an agreement is reached on the logistics of the hostage release, the bombardments will stop, adding that \"some of that activity has already decreased somewhat.\"",
      "\"We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible. For that to happen, there can't be a war going on in the middle of it,\" Rubio said. \"And Hamas has to agree to turn them over. We have to have the right people go in and get them. That's what we're going to focus on right now.\"",
      "The secretary of state said \"it's going to be very important for our partners and region who signed on to this deal,\" urging the leaders of countries including the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt to put \"a lot of pressure on Hamas to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Since Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people and 251 were taken hostage, Israel and Hamas have been at war, as Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed. Israeli authorities say around 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Beyond the hostage agreement, Hamas suggested Friday that other portions of the deal should be subject to negotiation, while Mr. Trump said he believes the group is \"ready for a lasting PEACE.\"",
      "Rubio said setting up a civilian Palestinian leadership that \"are not terrorists and aren't sponsoring terrorism \u2014 that's not going to happen in 72 hours.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, Marco Rubio. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It would be extraordinary to end what has been one of Israel's longest and bloodiest wars. The prime minister said he's only allowing these talks that will be underway in Egypt to go for a few days. What exactly is the deadline for Hamas and the terror groups who are holding hostages? When do they need to release them?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, yeah, so a couple points. Hamas has- obviously, look, we're dealing with Hamas. Okay. So let's take that with- for what it is. But they have said that they agree with the President's framework for the release of the hostages. So what those talks should be about, and some of that conversation is already happening now, it's not waiting until Monday in Cairo, is the logistics behind the release of these hostages. How do you stop the fighting? Who's going to go in and get them? You know, when are they going to be released? Where are they picked up? What are the processes for this? That's what should be- that's what this conversation should be about at this point, because they've agreed to the framework of it. Then there's second- beyond that is what happens after that. And that is, how do we ensure that we can create and help build a Gaza free of terrorism, free of Hamas, free of anything like Hamas and that's going to take work and some time, not just to agree on but to implement. But that's important, because that's what's going to bring a permanent end to these hostilities in the long term. And so those are the two phases here. But right now, the most emergent and immediate phase is the one that Hamas claims to have agreed to already, and that is they are prepared to release the hostages. Let's discuss, through the mediators, the logistics and the mechanics behind how that happens. And that has to happen very quickly. That cannot drag on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So my sources have indicated to me that because the upper echelon of Hamas fighters has been so decimated, communication is difficult. The other terror groups who also hold hostages in Gaza aren't necessarily easily controlled by them. How do you manage around this reality and is full release by October 7 the demand?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I don't know about the date. I'd be great if it was before October 7. We wish it would happen yesterday. But there are realities here, and then there are things people do to impede progress. Reality is, this is a war zone. I mean, this is a place that suffered a tremendous amount of destruction that fighting needs to stop. You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on, but at the same time that can't, you know- so that has to end, but that has to stop, but you also have to work through the other logistics. Who's going to go pick them up? We saw how this happened in the past. You know, the Red Cross would go in, they would be handed over through this process, et cetera. And so all of that's what has to be worked on, and is being worked on as we speak. So I'm not telling you there aren't some logistical hurdles here, but I am saying that the expectation is that this happens quickly. And I would also say that while we want all the hostages to be released, if there are five that are ready to go right now, they should be released right now. If another 10 are ready to go in 12 hours after that, the next group should come out, but ultimately they should all come out. And I think what you're hearing from people is, yes, there has to be some logistics that have to be worked through. But what you can't have, and what we can't see, and what we hope we will not see, is that we get into these talks, and these talks are then delayed, and it looks like they're unnecessarily delaying it. That would be a very bad sign. Let's hope that's not what happens. And it's going to be very important for our partners in the region who signed on to this deal, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, etc, for them to be putting a lot of pressure on Hamas to make sure this happens as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0But you pointed out that releases can't happen when bombardments are underway. Our CBS team in Gaza tells us that there are Israeli bombardments underway. There were strikes Saturday. Tens killed, more injured, bombings continuing. One incident included 10 people killed when they tried to check in on their homes in areas where there are also military sites. Is that acceptable?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think, ultimately, what you're going to see here is that when an agreement is reached on these logistics behind when the release is going to happen, then I think you'll see those bombardments stop, and I think some of that activity has already decreased somewhat. So, there's a framework here, and the framework is simple. Once you agree on the logistics of how this is going to happen, I think the Israelis and everyone acknowledge you can't release hostages in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop. And, as you saw, the president state that very clearly on Friday, where he asked the Israelis to begin to pull back to create the conditions for these releases--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not a violation of that?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, we're trying to get the hostages out. That's the bottom line. We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible. For that to happen, there can't be a war going on in the middle of it, and Hamas has to agree to turn them over. We have to have the right people go in and get them. That's what we're going to focus on right now, and that's what we're going to- that's what we've been focused on, and that's what the talks are going to be about today, on Monday, on Tuesday, to get this done as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you, there are two phases here. The Hamas releasing the hostages is the one you're most focused on. But, big picture, does the United States assess that Israel has so reduced the threat posed by Hamas that it can end combat and transition to the kind of lower-tempo counter-terrorism campaign that, say, the United States carries out against terrorist threats to this country?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, look, I mean, the ideal outcome here is you don't have to carry out any counter-terror missions because there are no terrorists in Gaza--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can they take the win? Can Netanyahu say he won this war?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: \u00a0Well, first of all, creating a Gaza, or setting up a Gaza that is governed by Palestinian technocrats that are not terrorists and are not sponsoring terrorism, that's not going to happen in 72 hours. That's going to take some time to build up, and it's going to require a lot of work and a lot of international support, and that's the end goal here of this entire endeavor, after you get the hostages out. By the way, if you can't get the hostages out, you have no hope of getting that done. So that's why I say, you know that these two steps need to happen. But it's going to take a lot of hard work and time. You know, you're trying to build something that doesn't exist right now, which is a sort of civilian, Palestinian leadership that's not tied to terrorism. That doesn't exist right now. It's going to take a lot of help from international partners. That's why having the countries in the region and the Europeans and all others involved in this in both money and resources, that's why building that coalition is so critical, and then implementing it is not going to be easy. It's going to take some time here, but I think, certainly, for the first time in a long time, you see the framework and the outlines of something that could work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But combat operations can end?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, that's the goal here. Well, you wouldn't need combat operations if there weren't terrorists there. But, by the same token, I would remind everybody, if, in fact, at the end of all this terrorism and a terrorist group remains active inside of Gaza, you're not going to have peace. That's the fundamental truth here that everyone needs to accept. You're never going to have peace in Gaza as long as there are terrorists operating from that territory, threatening the security of Israel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of occupation and combat operations, that's different than a counterterrorism campaign. But, let me ask you specifically what President Trump said. He told Barak Ravid of Axios that Prime Minister Netanyahu, quote, \"took it very far and Israel lost a lot of support in the world. Now I'm going to get all that support back.\" At what point did President Trump decide that Netanyahu took this fight in Gaza, or his operations throughout the Middle East- When did he take it too far?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: I think the President's- the president's observation, basically, is that because of the length of this war and how it's gone- we've all seen the international narrative. We've all seen it, whether we agree with it or not. We have seen countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and others come out and sort of signal support, or announce support for a Palestinian state. We have seen, even in our own domestic politics, some of the attacks on Israel. We don't forget what happened on October 7. That's the other thing the President repeatedly points to is, remember October 7. But the impli- whether we agree with it or not, we have seen the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. And I think that's the point the President is making here, is that whether you believe it was justified or not, right or not, that we- you cannot ignore the impact that this has had on Israel's global standing. That said, if we never want to see this happen again, meaning a war like this, you can never have another October 7 or anything like it ever happen again. And that's the thing the President has reiterated and repeatedly made clear to our partners in the region, and that is, if you truly want peace and stability and a better future for the Palestinian people, then there has to be a Gaza that is not governed or controlled in any way, shape or form by Hamas, or anything that looks like Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Does the United States support a Palestinian state? Because point 19 in your White House plan talks about \"a credible pathway to Palestinian self determination and statehood.\"",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, again, we've always said, I mean, this has been a consistent position throughout, that the only way you're ever going to have anything that looks like statehood is in a negotiated deal with the Israelis. We are so far from that right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0Right, but Prime Minister Netanyahu opposes a Palestinian state and thanked President Trump for speaking against recognition of one. That's why I'm asking you to clarify.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, we haven't recognized the Palestinian state--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --the United States has not. And right now, there's no point in doing that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the US want to see one?",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --because it's not even possible. That's not even a realistic thing right now. Because who, who would govern that Palestinian state, Hamas?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's point 19 in your plan--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Who would govern it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I thought.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, but that's talking about a pathway long term and in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEC. RUBIO: But one of the- before you can even get there, okay, that's, you know, before you can even get there, you have to have someone to turn that land- Israel's made clear they have no interest in governing Gaza. They have no interest in occupying Gaza long term and being the government of Gaza. I think Israel, I can't speak for Israel, but I think Israel would tell you they would love to turn over Gaza to a Palestinian organization that isn't terrorists. They would love to do that. But that doesn't exist right now. That has to be built, and that's going to take time. You're not going to build that in 72 hours. You're not going to build that in 72 weeks. I mean, it's going to take some time to get to that point. So that's the pathway this discusses. And I think if you look forward into the future where there is suddenly a Palestinian government-like organization, that can govern territory, then there's a lot of possibilities. But that has to be negotiated and agreed to by Israel. In the end, it's very simple. There can be peace in Gaza, there can be Palestinian governance in Gaza, whether you call it statehood or something else, as long as it is not terrorists that are in charge of that territory. That's what Israel agreed to when they turned over Gaza in the first place, and then Hamas took over Gaza and turned it into a terrorist camp, and that's what's led us to the point that we are at today. So we can get off that road and onto a different road. There are a lot of possibilities long term and in the future, but right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So maybe?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --we are far from that. Right now, we need to get these hostages out, and we just need technocrats that are not terrorists to be able to begin the basic reconstruction of Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That interview was taped earlier today, with the camera off, Secretary Rubio clarified that President Trump still opposes Israeli annexation of the West Bank though there is no mention of the Occupied Territory in the 20 point White House peace plan."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Chuck Schumer that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. Senator Chuck Schumer is the top Democrat on the other side of the Capitol and he joins us now from New York City. Good morning to you, leader. I want to pick up on something the Speaker of the House was pointing to. He wants this fight to be about illegals, as he said. And I want to be specific here, because we know from our research that there is no federal money that goes towards health care tax credits for undocumented immigrants in this country. The federal government doesn't fund health insurance for the undocumented. But it is also true that states like yours, New York, does provide health care for people who are in this country illegally. And their argument seems to be the money here is fungible, and bottom line is, it comes out of the federal pocket. Do you want to respond to that?",
      "SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: You know, they don't want to, Johnson doesn't want to discuss the real issue, the health care crisis facing the American people. So he puts up all these fake lies to try and divert attention. It's his standard operation. He just is concerned with the politics. Every independent agency that looks at this says Johnson's claim is false. And just as you said, Margaret, no, zero federal dollars can go to undocumented immigrants through Medicare, through Medicaid, through ACA. And so we ought to be talking about the real issue here, which is that we have a health care crisis in America caused by the Republicans. They've caught, they barreled us towards a shutdown because they don't want to deal with that crisis. Plain and simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about the shutdown in a moment. In terms of health care, where you've taken us, in terms of the messaging, Democrats, as I understand it, are looking for an extension of those Obamacare tax credit. I believe you'd like them permanently. You heard the speaker say we can talk about that after the government is reopened, perhaps not permanently. But do you hear any kind of opening here for a negotiation whatsoever?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Well, right now, not. Look, Johnson's not serious about this. He sent his, all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How are you going to negotiate? --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well he says the job is in the Senate. With you and leader Thune --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And he's, well, no you need, no, you actually need Johnson if you're going to negotiate any agreement. You need Johnson, Thune, Trump, Schumer and Jeffries. And the reason he sent them home is because he's more interested in protecting the Epstein files than protecting the American people from the health care crisis. We've been trying for months and months to sit down with them and have a serious conversation addressing America's health care needs. And they've refused and refused and refused. And just on your show and on other shows, when they asked him, well, will you do it in January. He says, it's starting in January. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He says, no, we'll have a conversation. Well, you know what, later means never. And we've tried 45 days and 45 days and 45 days from March on. We asked them to vote on it three times. The Republicans in the Senate, they voted no three times. So we need to solve this crisis. Look --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That was a permanent extension. The bill that I think you're referring to is Senator Shaheen. It was a permanent extension. It wasn't the, you know --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He, Johnson has not committed --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Compromise that some Republicans have proposed. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Yeah. Margaret, Johnson has not committed to any extension and he won't until the American people force him to. And it doesn't, and by the way, the crisis doesn't start in January. Two days ago, starting October 1, millions of Americans are getting notices that their health care premiums are dramatically increasing. If you're a 55 year old couple, and you pay, make $80,000, you know how much your premiums will go up if we don't extend it? It will go up something like $25,000. The average American will pay $900 more. How do Americans who are struggling, sitting at the table Friday night figuring out how to pay the bills, how the heck can they get such an increase? Democrats are simple. We want to extend it and so they won't have to pay that increase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And Johnson does not want to do it. He's just not serious about it, as exemplified by him sending the House home for two weeks. You need to be here to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, you're using word extend versus making permanent, just making clear there. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Look. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And then the number we see is the average increase of about $1,000 in premium payments for most households that will go into effect.",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Right, right. Yeah and it's horrible. And, it's horrible. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- On the reopening everything conversation, sir, though. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Yes. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --\u00a0 I mean, do you trust leader Thune? And when you look at just your numbers here, three senators already crossed over to vote with Republicans on the short-term funding deal. Are you concerned about more defections?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Look, it's a Republican shutdown because they've refused to talk with us. Johnson, I saw him mentioned that we did it 13 times when I was majority leader. That's true. You know why? In every case, we sat down and talked with the Republicans and there was a give and take, and then both sides didn't get everything they wanted, but we got it done. They have refused to talk to us even once. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well, Thune, Thune told Fox that there were ongoing, ongoing conversations. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- And Jeffries and I have been trying to get them to talk to us, for, they tried to get us to talk to them for, we've tried to talk to them for months and months and months. And they said no. The American people know that they're in charge. Republican President, Republican Senate, Republican House. That they have a responsibility to govern, which means sit down and talk with us so we can address these needs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But back to the question of defections. Leader Thune was on another network, on Fox, and he said that there are conversations with Democrats who want to find an off ramp here. Is he having conversations with Democrats other than you? Are you sure you can't, will you have defections?",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: Yeah. Margaret. I've encouraged my Democratic members to sit and talk to Republicans. It's always good when Democrats and Republicans talk to each other, but two points. First, in those conversations, the Republicans offered nothing. And, but second, the only way this will ultimately be solved is if five people sit together in a room and solve it. And they are the president, who also doesn't seem serious about this. You know he's putting out his memes and his things with the grim reaper and all of that stuff. He's playing golf. Johnson's not serious, and so we've got to sit down, the five of us. That's the way to solve this problem. But when Democrats talk to Republicans, it's a good thing. And I've encouraged my Democrats to do it, but they've offered us nothing. No change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you tried calling President Trump? He seems to take phone calls. Directly. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- Well you know, we sat, we tried to get President Trump to sit down with us weeks ago, long before the shutdown day started. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So no. Okay. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He said, he said yes. He said, no. Johnson told him to say no. We sat down, you know, the day before, and he wasn't serious. He put these red hats on the table, and he's joking around. And honestly, in the meeting, Margaret, I got the feeling he didn't even know what was happening. That the crisis was impending. That people would pay such a --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- He once said they're going to pay all that. That would be bad for me. And so the court here is the American people. The American people are hearing what's happening, and they are demanding that we address this crisis. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: -- They are demanding we sit down together and do it. It's just logical. They are, say that, you know, in your survey that you put out --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: --\u00a0 They say that 75% people feel Trump isn't doing enough. Another survey by the Washington Post showed that not only do 80% of the American people want us to extend these credits, but 55% of Trump voters --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well our, our --",
      "SENATOR SCHUMER: --\u00a0 The American people are right now talking to their senators, you know, talking to their congressmen. They're telling them, get this done. We want to get it done. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Our CBS polling also shows that neither side is getting good grades on any of this. Leader, we're going to have to leave that here for this moment. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the government shutdown now in its fifth day. House. Speaker Mike Johnson joins us from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you, Speaker. Anyone up there to negotiate with?",
      "SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON: There's not, Margaret. Good morning. Good to hear your voice. It's kind of quiet around here. It has been for the last several days, and it's very unfortunate, because, as we're talking real people are being adversely affected around the country in some and in very substantial ways. I pray that more Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing, and when they have the next opportunity on Monday to vote to open the government, I surely hope that they will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did send your lawmakers home to their districts, which suggests we've got probably another week ahead of us of this shutdown. You mentioned the real world impact federal workers, including our military, would miss their first paychecks October 15th or 16th. How long should workers plan to be without that income?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, the only person who can answer that question is your next guest and that's Chuck Schumer, because the House did its job. The reason that House Republicans are home working in their districts, and I suspect House Democrats should be as well, is because we did that. We passed a bipartisan, very clean continuing resolution a couple of weeks back now, and sent it to the Senate. It's very important to note what was in that. It was only 24 pages in length, Margaret. It was a good faith effort to keep the government open for seven more weeks so that Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion, could work together to fund the government with the appropriations process. Chuck Schumer always voted for those in the past. In fact, he did it 13 times during the four years of the Biden administration, but now suddenly he's commanding his Democrats in the Senate not to do it, and there's one simple reason why. They need political cover from the far left corner of the base. He's afraid, Chuck Schumer, individually- ask him about it. He's afraid he's going to get a challenge from the Marxist left in his party, because that's the new wave in New York. That's what this is about. Chuck Schumer is trying to show a fight against the President and Republicans and real Americans are being harmed in the process of this political game.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, Democrats, as you know, want to have another conversation in regard to extending some tax subsidies that lower the cost of some health care that's purchased through the Obamacare market. To that point, though, you're talking about the politics of this, our CBS polling that we released today shows neither party's stance is viewed as worth shutting down this government. The Democrats want to talk about the tax credits. You know, premium pricing is already being set now, even if this doesn't expire until end of the year. Your fellow Republican, Jen Kiggans said, \"raising costs for families with little notice and potentially stripping them of access to care is simply unacceptable.\" Doesn't she have a point here?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: There's a lot of points to be made on that, and we're ready to talk about, negotiate and do all of that, but they're trying to create that as a red herring here right now. Margaret, this is a funding bootstrap measure, a very simple, very conventional thing that's been done here all the time. This is the way it works now. We need a little more time on the clock to finish the appropriations process. We have plenty of time to debate that very complicated issue. It's not a simple one. There has to be reforms to that subsidy, because there's a lot of fraud, waste and abuse involved in it. There's a- there's 535 members of Congress in the House and Senate. There's a- there's probably 400 different ideas on how to fix that, so we need a little time to do it. We're not saying that we won't negotiate it. We're saying turn the lights back on in Congress. Get troops paid TSA agents and border patrol agents paid who are trying to protect us. Restore the health care programs that are being stalled for veterans and Medicare recipients who are getting home health, it's all stalled now, restore FEMA flood insurance programs in the middle of hurricane--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. Turn the lights back on.--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- and WIC programs for young women. We got to get this fixed now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to clarify what you were just saying, do I hear you correctly? That you, as Speaker of the House, want to see the tax credit extended at a future date? Is that what you are saying?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No, I haven't staked out any position on it yet, because that's not how this process works. We're in a deliberative body--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Right, I'm asking your position because you said--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- I'm the speaker of the House--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- you'd be willing to talk about it--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- I'm telling you my position- I'm the Speaker of the House. What I have to do is draw consensus among 435 members of my body. I don't get out and project what the final conclusion is going to be. And I've told Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, most recently in the Oval Office with the President just five, six days ago, keep the government open so that we can do that job. We were always planning to do that. Again, that funding runs out December 31. The month of October is a critical time for us to get to this. But we can't when Chuck Schumer keeps voting to shut the government down for political reasons. That's purely and simply what's happening here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe you have time here, but our partner at health policy think tank KFF reported 80% of all premium tax credits went to ObamaCare enrollees in Trump won states. Red states. Do you really- do worry at all that this stance could backfire, that waiting to talk about the tax credit could hurt you and could hurt your voters?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No- no. No, because we have time to do it again. The funding doesn't run out until December 31st. We're talking about a September 30th deadline that's now passed to keep the government open so that Republicans and Democrats can have that very debate. Chuck Schumer has shut it off because he needs a political argument right now. 100% Margaret, that's what this is about. Play the tape. Play the tape of Chuck Schumer saying consistently for the last 30 years that CRs are dangerous, destructive, and selfish. He is now the captain of it, and it's on him. Republicans in the House, Senate, and the White House want to keep the government open, and we have voted to do so. Democrats are shutting it down--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are committing to have that conversation about health care is what I understand you saying?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: It was- it was always going to continue. They're making this up. That is a red herring. They're trying to- they're trying to say that this fight right now is about that. That wasn't even a fight. It's a joke. Call him on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the director of the Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, was on another network this morning, and said it is up to the President of the United States to decide when the mass layoffs will begin. He seems to be indicating the President is using those RIFs, those reduction-in-force threats, as leverage here. Do you know how quickly those layoffs will start?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: I don't know. I anticipate it will have to be soon, because Chuck Schumer turned off the funding sources and whomever is the chair of the office--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Do you want that as leverage?--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- No, nor- neither does the President. No. The President wants the government open. He's pleaded with Schumer and Hakeem in person in his office to do that, and they said no, because they want to do this. You know what they counter-proposed? They want to spend $1.5 trillion, and they want to return hard-working taxpayer dollars to fund health care for illegal aliens. It is in their bill. Go to\u00a0speaker.gov\u00a0and see it for yourself. Page 57, Section 2141. They're using this for political games, and it is shameful, and real people are getting hurt.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that- I have looked at that text, it doesn't explicitly say what you are indicating--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON:-- Well, wait a minute--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But unauthorized immigrants are intelligible for ACA benefits--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- This is very important. Yes it does. It's- it says very simply, they want to repeal the changes that we made in the- in the Working Families Tax Cut, the One Big Beautiful Bill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's right--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: -- And what those changes were is it removed health care going to illegal aliens. It removed all the fraud, waste and abuse. And the Congressional Budget Office, CBO said it achieved the desired result. They project it will save almost $200 billion. Chuck Schumer's proposal on page 57 wants to return that $200 billion of taxpayer funds to pay for illegal aliens and other non-citizens. That is a fact, and you can check it out on my website\u00a0speaker.gov. Don't trust me. Look at Chuck Schumer's own paperwork.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, thank you for your time. This morning, we'll be right back with a lot more 'Face the Nation'. Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the former Commanding General of the U.S. Army in Europe, retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. And he joins us from Germany. Welcome to 'Face The Nation.'",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL (RETIRED) BEN HODGES: Thank you very much, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up- pick up where we left off with Senator Duckworth, who is a Purple Heart recipient for her time serving this country in combat. Men and women have different basic fitness standards. The Secretary, in his remarks at Quantico, said women- or he suggested women were being given a pass or were held to lower standards for fitness requirements. Do you think his change to the quote unquote male standard is necessary?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: I think this is completely unnecessary. I have 38 years in the Army, and we've served with women in all sorts of different environments and deployments, and I never had a case where a female soldier was not able to do what she had to do. So this is a- seems to me an unnecessary, almost a medieval approach, that doesn't reflect the requirements that we have for women and men who are intelligent, able to operate in a modern battlefield environment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Defense Secretary made these remarks at Quantico last week, as you well know, ordered in our most senior military officers to hear him lay out what he talked about in terms of changing rules of engagement, those codes of conduct and standards to make war less brutal. The Secretary said this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY PETE HEGESTH: We also don't fight with stupid rules of engagement. We untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement. Just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for war fighters.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of those directives to officers?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, that's- that's not going to help anybody accomplish their mission. I mean, when you think about the missions that we had in Afghanistan, for example, and I think that's where some of his experience comes from. It was to protect Afghan civilians so that they could reestablish government and secure themselves, and so it was not about how many Taliban could you kill. We had already tried that, and that didn't work. So the rules of engagement are not 'politically correct.' They're not intended to make it harder for soldiers or units to do their job. They actually are part of the mission. Why are we there? And so I don't have any experience where killing a lot of innocent people or violating the Geneva Convention is going to help accomplish the mission. I think that the idea that we should- that somehow is going to make us better and more effective by people not having to worry about the law is going to be bad for us in the long term as well, both psychologically for soldiers, but also the trust of the American people and of our allies and American forces, where we have always lived up to international law, and that is where a lot of the respect came from. We do not want to be like the Russian army, and they certainly don't worry about rules of engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Geneva Conventions are something that the Secretary, as a private citizen, wrote about in his book and questioned whether they should be followed at all. He said, 'What if we treated the enemy the way they treated us?' And if I mean, he talked about Al Qaeda and using some of their tactics, it- rip their arms off, feed them to the hogs. I mean, this sounds tough, but in terms of practice, does it risk the lives of- of those who are the trigger pullers, those who are on the ground, to have this message delivered from the highest levels?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, first of all, the Geneva Conventions were constructed starting in 1949 after the Second World War, and they were intended to protect innocent people, helpless people, non-combatants, from the ravages of war, as it did happen in the Second World War. And I don't think anybody would say that Dwight Eisenhower was woke and here he was- he was Chief of Staff of the Army, and then Supreme Allied Commander, and then President. So this was during his time that the United States helped create and sign the Geneva Conventions. So here's a guy with more combat experience and wartime experience than almost anybody. Now, the- when you think about modern warfare, especially when you're counter terrorism, just as Secretary Rubio was describing earlier on your program, the people, how you deal with enemy and how you deal with populations, is how you defeat an insurgency. And killing everybody in sight is not how you defeat an insurgency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As Defense Secretary Hegseth fired the top military lawyers who advise on lethality, here's some of the advice he gave to senior leaders this week.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY PETE HEGESTH: You kill people and break things for a living in this profession, you feel comfortable inside the violence so that our citizens can live peacefully. Lethality is our calling card and victory our only acceptable end state.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think that means?",
      "BEN HODGES: Well, first of all, it's not connected to the reality of how these things happen, how wars are won. First of all, the political leadership has to describe the end state. What is what is it we're going to do? Why are we sending troops somewhere? What are they supposed to accomplish? And usually it's not going to be by killing everybody in sight. So I can't- I think there's a disconnect between this idea that it's all about lethality and that we kill people and break things. That's- that's not the mantra of any army unit I was ever in in 38 years. It was always about accomplish the mission that was assigned to us, carry out every lawful order, and do it in such a way that protects civilians and ensures that all of our soldiers are protected and come back home safe. This idea of break things and kill people, that's what the Russians did in Bucha and Mariupol. That's not who we are. We're the soldiers of a free, democratic country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President also spoke at that gathering. He referred to the 'enemy within'. He also spoke about using U.S. cities like Chicago as training grounds. Are you comfortable with people thinking that?",
      "LT. GEN. (RET.) HODGES: Well, look, I think first of all, U.S. military- our fellow citizens should be confident that U.S. military will always carry out lawful orders. And so it's alarming when all of the judge advocates general or the army- or the military lawyers are sacked or sent away because Commanders do need to have legal counsel as they receive orders and they look at these complex situations, but our troops will carry out lawful orders. I guarantee you that no soldier wants to have to use force against American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lieutenant General, thank you for your insights. We have to leave it there."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. Good morning, and good to have you here, in person. So, I have to ask you about what the President announced yesterday in regard to federalizing 300 National Guardsmen out in the state of Illinois. We've heard this threat going back all the way to August. The governor says these are not needed. Do you have any idea when they'll arrive?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I believe they're going to be Illinois National Guardsmen. So, they're not going to be coming from out of state. I spoke with our governor yesterday, and it looks like it's going to be about 300 Illinois Guardsmen who will be activated against the governor's wishes. So they'll be they'll be homegrown Illinoisans, and they're our brothers and sisters, our neighbors. I probably served with quite a number of them, certainly the leadership. And, you know, they'll be home. We'll welcome them. It's a misuse of the National Guard. They're they're not needed in this particular role. If President Trump really wanted to fight crime, then maybe he should stop defunding the police he, you know, he diverted $800 million in crime prevention efforts away from- that was appropriated away from funding for our police officers. So, you know, I- they're not needed, but we're going to welcome them, because they're our brothers and sisters, and we're proud of our National Guard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He has surged, or the federal government has surged, agents from different groups. The FBI said yesterday they're sending folks in. Tell me about these protests, because the images look pretty intense of what has happened between people on the streets of Chicago, we're showing some of that video now, around immigration issues. As I understand yesterday, ice authorities shot a Chicago woman in the Brighton Park area. Secretary Noem claimed ICE fired defensive shots at this woman, who was armed, who had appeared in a border patrol intelligence bulletin previously. She claims that federal agents were surrounded and were threatened. What are local authorities telling you about what they think happened here?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, they lie, right? The Trump administration lies. We have a president who is a known liar, and they have been- they've been lying about the situation all along. And, in fact, they even shot tear grenades- tear gas grenades, I think, at a reporter who was simply driving by with her window open. And so, we're urging people, we're urging our protesters, remain calm, peaceful protests, exercise the First Amendment rights. But video-tape everything. Everybody has a phone; tape everything, so we actually have real evidence of what is happening. We know the Trump administration lies consistently. And what I am hearing is that, for the large part, people are being very quiet, are being very respectful. But ICE is being very aggressive. Remember that they are zip-tying children. They are raiding apartment blocks in the middle of the night, separating children from their families, pulling people out onto the streets naked. They are using Gestapo tactics in Chicago, and this is what Trump wants to do, right? He wants to intimidate the people of Chicago. That's not going to happen, and we're going to document everything and make sure, just as the judge in Portland said, that these- these requirements, these orders from the Trump administration, are not actually tied to reality.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about President Trump's directive to send Oregon National Guard troops into Portland, and the judge said that- untethered to the facts. But, in this case, I mean, the Homeland Security Advisor says there's a large and growing movement of left-wing terrorism, organized and funded. They're posting, on Homeland Security, images of snipers. So we're not talking troops, we're talking about federal agents that are carrying out some of this right now. Have you seen any evidence of what Stephen Miller is describing here in terms of organization and targeting of federal agents?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: No, not at all. This is- it's simply not happening. They are lying. And so, if anybody is targeting anyone, it is out of control ICE agents targeting, again, zip-tying children, throwing reporters onto the ground, separating children from their mothers, trying to convince schools to turn over kids from public schools. They are raging through the streets of Chicago, trying to intimidate everyday, ordinary citizens, or just trying to go to school and go to work. That's not acceptable. That's not what America is about. And it is shameful that the present United States has instigated this on one of its greatest cities. He should be defending the city. He should be protecting the city. Send us the federal dollars that were appropriated in a bipartisan way to support law enforcement. They took money away from law enforcement officers, child prevention effort- violence against children prevention efforts. They- they've literally, this president, has defunded the police.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is counter their messaging, at least. But on the messaging around the military, I want to ask you about what happened at Quantico. And, just so our viewers are clear, you serve on Armed Services, but you retired from the National Guard. You were a lieutenant colonel.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: 23 years proud of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Blackhawk helicopter pilot in Iraq. You served in combat. Secretary Hegseth told senior military leaders just a few days ago he doesn't want to prevent women from serving, but he's now going to require everyone meet the male standard. Let's listen to that.",
      "((BEGIN VIDEO CLIP))",
      "SECRETARY OF WAR PETE HEGSETH: When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral. If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.",
      "((END VIDEO CLIP))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How did you hear those remarks, and how do you think female service people heard them?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, this is the least qualified Secretary of Defense in our nation's history, and he's questioning the ability of the women who actually qualify to their- to do their jobs. The female Rangers, the female that graduated from seal school, have met those highest standards. And, by the way, he is obfuscating a little bit because there are different male standards. The standard for 45 year-old man is not the same as an 18 year-old man. So he doesn't actually talk about that. He has long sought to push women out of the military. And, frankly, our military could not do its job of protecting America and keeping us safe without the women who serve in the military. If you look at some lessons we learned in Afghanistan, for example, the lionesses, the Marine Corps group of women who actually went on patrol, all-female units that actually was able to get intelligence from women- Afghani women to get information on the enemy. Frankly, you've got a least qualified secretary of defense in the nation's history who wastes taxpayer dollars on a regular basis doing things like bringing in general and flag officers to be an audience for his dog and pony show, using them as little toy soldiers when they should be out there at your units in command, doing their jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time and for your insight. We'll be back in a moment."

    "summary": "The plan called for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hopes to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza \"in the coming days,\" after Hamas said it has agreed to parts of the peace plan that President Trump\u00a0outlined earlier this week.",
      "In a brief statement late Saturday, Netanyahu said he has sent a delegation to Egypt \"to finalize technical details,\" adding that \"our goal is to contain these negotiations to a time frame of a few days.\"",
      "But Netanyahu signaled there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, something Hamas has long demanded.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said in a statement that while they agreed to parts of the peace deal, including the demand to release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the group suggested other portions of the deal should be subject to negotiation.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News the United States views Hamas' response as positive, though there are details that still need to be hammered out, such as the decommissioning of weapons, which may begin as soon as next week.",
      "After Hamas released its statement, Mr. Trump said Friday on Truth Social that he believes the group is \"ready for a lasting PEACE.\" He pushed Israel to cease hostilities in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out,\" the president wrote.",
      "\"In light of Hamas's response, Israel is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump's plan for the immediate release of all hostages,\" a statement released by Netanyahu's office early Saturday morning local time read. \"We will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set forth by Israel that are consistent with President Trump's vision.\"",
      "In a separate statement, the Israel Defense Forces said that its high-level military officials held a meeting overnight, in which Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the IDF chief of staff, \"instructed to advance readiness for the implementation of the first phase of the Trump plan for the release of the hostages.\"",
      "An Israeli political source told CBS News that the cessation of the IDF's activity in the Gaza Strip is intended to allow Hamas to begin organizing for the release of the hostages. The source added that this is not an official ceasefire that would require Hamas to return the hostages within 72 hours, as outlined in the plan.",
      "\"This is not the beginning of a withdrawal, although there may be tactical improvements for the purpose of protecting our soldiers,\" the source added. \"We are constantly examining what is happening on the ground and will not allow the terrorist organizations to try to take advantage of the opportunity and carry out a last-minute attack, or to strengthen their grip on the ground.\"",
      "The source said the negotiations are expected to begin on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, another source familiar with Israel's negotiation team told CBS News that it was getting ready to travel.",
      "U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is set to travel to Egypt for the talks, a senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, is also expected to attend. CBS News has reached out to the White House for more details.",
      "In a video posted to Truth Social later Friday, Mr. Trump called the deal \"unprecedented in many ways\" and thanked several Arab and majority Muslim countries that assisted with the deal as mediators, including Qatar and Egypt.",
      "\"This is a big day,\" Mr. Trump said in the video. \"We'll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down and concrete.\"",
      "In a follow-up post to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump wrote: \"After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, which will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!\"",
      "The post included a map of what the proposed withdrawal line could look like.",
      "Also Saturday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second most powerful militant group in Gaza, said it accepted Hamas' response to the Trump plan. The group had previously rejected the proposal days earlier.",
      "Hamas says it's willing to release hostages, hand over control of Gaza",
      "Hamas said it is willing to release all living hostages and the remains of deceased hostages \"in accordance with the exchange formula set forth in President Trump's proposal.\" The proposal laid out by the White House called for Hamas to release all hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, within 72 hours, and for Israel to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the conflict.",
      "The deal also called for an immediate end to fighting if both sides accept the deal, and for Israel's military to withdraw to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "Hamas also said it is willing to \"hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and with the support of Arab and Islamic parties\" \u2014 another portion of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Egyptian official told the AP that talks are underway for the release of hostages, as well as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The official, who is involved in the ceasefire negotiations, also said Arab mediators are preparing for a comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians. The talks are aimed at unifying the Palestinian position toward Gaza's future.",
      "The group was less clear on other portions of the deal. The statement said some aspects of Mr. Trump's proposal \"remain linked to a comprehensive national stance, grounded in relevant international laws and resolutions.\" It said those issues will need to be discussed \"within an inclusive Palestinian national framework\" that includes Hamas.",
      "It's not clear if Hamas has agreed that it will play no role in the governance of Gaza, which was one provision of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "The plan, unveiled Sept. 29 by Mr. Trump and backed by Netanyahu, called for Hamas to free all remaining Israeli hostages and for the Israeli military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases, starting with an initial withdrawal before the hostages are freed. It also proposed handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" Palestinian committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Netanyahu, who joined Mr. Trump for a joint news conference at the White House when the 20-point proposal was announced, had said he supports the plan, and that if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "\"We're giving everybody a chance to have this done peacefully,\" Netanyahu had said, warning Hamas what would happen if they didn't agree to the proposal. \"But if Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done.\"",
      "The president told Netanyahu on Monday that if Hamas were to reject the proposal, \"you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had said his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\" The president on Monday also said he and Netanyahu were \"waiting for signatures and waiting for approvals from a lot of different countries that are involved in this.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",

      "A Kurdish group called the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights reported the men's execution, identifying them all as \"Arab political prisoners\" detained during protests in 2019.

      "In a country that ranks poorly internationally for gender equality, the 64-year-old Takaichi makes history as the first female leader of Japan's long-governing conservative Liberal Democratic Party. Takaichi is one of the most conservative members of the male-dominated party.",
      "An admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is a protege of former Japanese Prime Minister\u00a0Shinzo Abe's ultra-conservative vision and a regular at the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of Japan's wartime militarism, which could complicate Tokyo's relations with its Asian neighbors.",
      "Takaichi beat Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, in a runoff in a vote by the LDP on Saturday.",
      "Takaichi replaces Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba as the party hopes to regain public support and stay in power after major election losses.",
      "She is likely to be Japan's next prime minister because the party remains by far the largest in the lower house, which determines the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered.",
      "Takaichi hopes to strengthen U.S.-Japan alliance",
      "Takaichi later said she will immediately work on stemming rising prices, while also focusing on diplomatic and security challenges.",
      "A parliamentary vote is expected in mid-October. The LDP, which has been criticized by opposition leaders for creating a prolonged political vacuum, said Takaichi needs to hurry because the winner will soon face a diplomatic test: a possible summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who could demand that Japan increase its defense spending.",
      "A meeting is reportedly being planned for late October. Trump will travel to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea starting Oct. 31.",
      "Takaichi said ensuring the Japan-U.S. alliance is her top diplomatic priority.",
      "\"It is essential to ... confirm the reinforcement of the Japan-U.S. alliance,\" she said. Takaichi stressed the importance of their cooperation through three-way frameworks that also include regional partners such as South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, pledging Japan's greater role in achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.",
      "She said she respects all tariffs and investment agreements struck between Tokyo and Washington under the Ishiba government.",
      "Takaichi tackling domestic challenges",
      "The LDP, whose consecutive losses in parliamentary elections in the past year have left it in the minority in both houses, needs its new leader to quickly bring back voter confidence and stability and to address challenges in and outside Japan. Takaichi will also need cooperation from key opposition groups to implement her party's policies.",
      "Ishiba, who achieved a 15% tariff deal with Washington and put Japan's ties with South Korea and other Asian countries on track during his one-year stint, said \"I hope the LDP will band together under new (party) president Takaichi to serve for the country and the people, as well as the world and for the new era.\"",
      "Ishiba, a centrist known as archrival of Abe, was virtually forced into resigning by ultra-conservative wings in the party.",
      "5 candidates for the job",
      "Five candidates, two currently serving and three former ministers, vied for the LDP presidency.",
      "Saturday's vote only involved 295 LDP parliamentarians and about 1 million dues-paying members. It only reflected 1% of the Japanese public.",
      "The LDP's choice of Takaichi, instead of the more centrist-to-liberal Koizumi, apparently underscores the party's hope to win back conservative voters who supported emerging far-right groups such as Sanseito in the July parliamentary election.",
      "But the LDP also needs help from the opposition, which it has long neglected. The party will likely look to expand its current coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito with at least one of the key opposition parties, which are more centrist.",
      "Takaichi supports fiscal spending for growth",
      "Takaichi, like other candidate,s called herself a \"moderate conservative\" during the run-up to the election to show their willingness to work with the opposition and stayed away from stressing her opposition to liberal social issues or anti-China policies.",
      "Takaichi on Saturday said the Yasukuni issue should not be a diplomatic issue and that she will think about how she can \"pay respect to the war dead and pray for peace.\"",
      "She supports bigger fiscal spending for growth, a stronger military and cybersecurity, as well as tougher regulations on increasing foreign tourists and laborers. She was criticized for citing unconfirmed reports to slam foreigners for kicking deer in Nara, her hometown, and saying many foreign law offenders escaped indictments due to a shortage of translators.",
      "Experts say candidates avoided discussing their usual political views on historical issues, same-sex marriage and other contentious topics, including the party's political funds scandal, which was the biggest reason for their election losses, and anti-corruption measures. Their avoidance of these subjects raised doubts over the party's ability to regain public trust, analysts said.",

    "story": [
      "Police on Saturday were questioning six people arrested on suspicion of terror offenses after an attack on a synagogue in northwest England that left two men dead and Britain's Jewish community shocked and grieving.",
      "Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, was shot dead by police on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Manchester after he rammed a car into pedestrians, attacked them with a knife and tried to force his way into the building.",
      "Three men and three women, aged between 18 and their 60s, were arrested in the greater Manchester area on suspicion of the \"commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism,\" as police work to determine whether the attacker acted alone.",
      "Congregation members Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, died in the attack on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. Police say Daulby was accidentally shot by an armed officer as he and other congregants barricaded the synagogue to block Al-Shamie from entering. Three other men are hospitalized with serious injuries.",
      "Detectives say Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian origin who lived in Manchester, may have been influenced by \"extreme Islamist ideology.\" He wore what appeared to be an explosives belt, which was found to be fake.",
      "Police said Al-Shamie was out on bail over an alleged rape at the time of the attack but had not been charged.",
      "The attack has devastated Britain's Jewish community and intensified debate about the line between criticism of Israel and antisemitism.",
      "Recorded antisemitic incidents in the U.K. have risen sharply since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and Israel's ensuing war against Hamas in Gaza, according to Community Security Trust, a charity that provides advice and protection for British Jews.",
      "Some politicians and religious leaders claimed pro-Palestinian demonstrations, which have been held regularly since the war in Gaza began, had played a role in spreading hatred of Jews. The protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful but some say chants such as \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" incite anti-Jewish hatred.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters have frequently accused critics of Israel for its conduct of the war of antisemitism. Critics see it as an attempt to stifle even legitimate criticism.",
      "Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, the head of Orthodox Judaism in Britain, said the attack was the result of \"an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred\" on the streets and online.",
      "Some also say the U.K.'s recognition of a Palestinian state last month has emboldened antisemitism \u2014 a claim the government rejects. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was interrupted by boos and shouts of \"Shame on you\" on Friday as he addressed a vigil for victims of the attack in Manchester.",
      "Police in London urged organizers to call off a protest planned for Saturday to oppose the banning of the group Palestine Action, which has been labeled a terrorist organization by the government.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said protest organizers should \"recognize and respect the grief of British Jews this week\" and postpone the demonstration.",
      "The group Defend Our Juries said it would not cancel the protest, where hundreds of people are expected to risk arrest by holding signs supporting the banned group.",
      "Member Jonathon Porritt said protesters would \"demonstrate huge respect and real grief for those affected by the absolute atrocity at Heaton Park.\"",
      "\"But I don't think that means that we should be asked to give up on our right to stand up for those who are being devastated by an ongoing, real-time genocide in Gaza,\" he told the BBC.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 19:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "No one was hurt when two vessels that were part of a flotilla bound for Gaza mysteriously caught fire last month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly approved military operations on two vessels early last month that were part of a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying aid and pro-Palestinian supporters, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, CBS News has learned.",
      "Two American intelligence officials briefed on the matter told CBS News that Israeli forces on Sept. 8 and 9 launched drones from a submarine and dropped incendiary devices onto the boats that were moored outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said, causing a fire. The officials spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on national security matters.",
      "Under international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict, the use of incendiary weapons against a civilian population or civilian objects is prohibited in all circumstances.",
      "Israel has enforced a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip for more than a decade, first declaring the restriction in January 2009, when its navy announced the closure of the coastal waters to all maritime traffic. The move came some two years after Hamas took control of the region following a brief but violent civil war with the rival Fatah party, the political and military organization of Arab Palestinians, officially known as the Palestinian National Liberation Movement.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces didn't respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla organized the international maritime initiative that aims to break through Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and provide aid to the war-torn territory.",
      "On Sept. 8, an incendiary device was dropped onto the Family, a Portuguese-flagged vessel. The Global Sumud Flotilla told CBS News that on the night prior to the attack, Portuguese lawmaker Mariana Mort\u00e1gua was on board. The activists believe the perpetrators deliberately waited until \"elected officials or high-profile figures were absent,\" the group said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "On Sept. 9, the Alma, a British-flagged vessel, was attacked in a similar manner as the Family. In both cases, the group said last month that the boats were damaged by the fire but the crew was able to extinguish the flames quickly. No one was killed or injured.",
      "\"Confirmation of Israeli involvement would not surprise us; it would simply lay bare a pattern of arrogance and impunity so grotesque that it cannot escape eventual reckoning,\" the Global Sumud Flotilla said in its statement Friday.",
      "The statement added: \"Whether the purpose of these attacks was to kill us, scare us away, or disable our boats, they recklessly endangered civilians and humanitarian volunteers. The world must take note: attempts to silence, intimidate, or obstruct our commitment to the Palestinian cause and people will not succeed. We call for urgent, independent investigations into these attacks and full accountability for those responsible.\"",
      "In September, Tunisian authorities disputed that drones dropping incendiary devices caused the fire, instead claiming that an initial inspection indicated the explosion originated inside the boat, according to BBC News. Pro-Israeli accounts on social media claimed the fires were started after the activists did not use a flare gun properly.",
      "Footage released by the Global Sumud Flotilla and obtained by CBS News appears to show a ball of flames falling onto the boat, sparking the fire on board, instead of the fire originating from inside the vessel. The stationary cameras affixed to the vessels do not capture where the flames originated from prior to landing on the boat nor do they depict a flare gun being fired.",
      "In separate incidents in late September, the activist group said they were attacked by 15 low-altitude drones while sailing south of Greece. The Global Sumud Flotilla said at least 13 explosions were heard on and around several flotilla boats and objects were dropped on at least 10 boats, causing damage. While no casualties were reported, the activist group said that their communications systems were also disrupted.",
      "This week, Israeli naval forces intercepted most of the vessels bound for Gaza, detaining dozens of activists along with Thunberg and several European lawmakers, a move that drew swift international criticism.",
      "American citizens travelling on the flotilla have also been detained by Israel. A State Department official told CBS News that the department was monitoring the situation and is committed to providing assistance to U.S. citizens. The official also called the flotilla a \"deliberate and unnecessary provocation,\" particularly as the Trump administration continues to seek a negotiated solution to end the war in Gaza.",
      "Two Americans sailing with the Global Sumud Flotilla include Marine Corps veteran Jessica Clotfelter and Greg Stoker, organizer of the veterans' delegation to the group. On Wednesday, they spoke via Zoom to CBS News Chicago roughly an hour before the Israeli navy intercepted the flotilla.",
      "\"We are a civilian aid mission, trying to break the siege into Gaza, and we are carrying humanitarian aid in accordance with international humanitarian and maritime law,\" said Stoker.",
      "Clotfelter told CBS News Chicago that the images that have been coming out of Gaza for the last two years have been \"heartbreaking\" and \"gut-wreching.\"",
      "She added: \"I mean, I've cried probably every single day on this boat as the violence since we've taken off on 31 August has escalated.\"",

The latter could be considered a bigger accomplishment during such uncertain times, but the mystery of Finland's happiness eludes many, including the Finns themselves.",

      "\"Which is a different question than, you know, did you experience joy today, or did you smile or laugh today?\" Martela said.",
      "Meaningful happiness, in the case of the Finns, really comes down to contentment, which begs the question, why are Finns so content?",
      "\"The kind of society we have has been able to take care of the citizens relatively well,\" Martela explained.",

      "\"This is one of the great things about Helsinki, you're never too far from the natural environment,\" he said.",

After heating up, she takes a dip in the chilly Baltic Sea. The quick temperature changes release endorphins, but for Harju, it's about relaxation.",
      "Which brings back around what happiness really means for Finnish people, and why the country has dominated World Happiness charts for nearly a decade.",
      "\"I guess, like we have been given this unique life to live, and it would be like quite sad if you only followed external pressures on doing things that other people want,\" Martela said, \"like living somebody else's dream instead of our own dream.\"",

      "Perez noted that lap bands are \"notorious for causing long-term irritation.\"",
      "\"The lap band is, frankly, outdated,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I spend more time removing them than placing them \u2026 I\u2019ve pulled out bands years later that literally eroded into the stomach wall like a zipper that slowly chewed through fabric.\"",
      "\"In 2025, the smartest approach is no longer \u2018surgery or medication\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s using them together, strategically.\"",

      "Speaking during a Federalist Society panel this week, Adler said the high court\u2019s thinking might be that \"lower courts are doing too much. We\u2019re going to scale that back because it\u2019s not our place, and it\u2019s for the executive branch and the legislative branch to figure that out.\"",
      "The Trump administration has only challenged about one-fifth of the adverse rulings it has received from the lower courts. Adler said Solicitor General John Sauer, who represents the government, is strategically selecting which cases to bring to the high court.",
      "\"If you go through them, setting Humphrey\u2019s Executor stuff slightly to the side, what they all have in common is that there\u2019s a kind of clear argument that \u2026 district courts were a little too aggressive here,\" Adler said.",

      "The Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. (Valerie Plesch/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "The emergency docket, sometimes known as the shadow or interim docket, allows the Trump administration or plaintiffs to ask the Supreme Court to quickly intervene in lawsuits and temporarily pause lower court rulings. The process can take a couple of days, weeks or months, and is viewed as a much speedier, albeit temporary, way to secure court relief than when the high court fully considers the merits of a case, which can include a long briefing schedule and oral arguments.",
      "The Supreme Court's emergency docket this year has been extraordinarily active. Attorney Kannon Shanmugam, who has argued dozens of cases before the high court, said Trump's high volume of executive actions is partly the reason for that.",
      "\"[An increase in emergency motions] coincides with the rise of executive orders and other forms of unilateral executive action really as the primary form of lawmaking in our country with the disappearance of Congress, and that has posed enormous challenges for the court,\" Shanmugam said during the panel.",
      "Through the emergency docket, the Supreme Court has greenlit Trump's mass firings of career employees and high-profile terminations of Democratic appointees. It has curtailed nationwide injunctions and cleared the way for controversial deportations and immigration stops. The high court has said the government can, for now, withhold billions of dollars in foreign aid and discharge transgender service members from the military.",
      "In other instances, parties on both sides have construed Supreme Court outcomes as wins.",
      "In one such order, the Supreme Court said the Trump administration must attempt to return Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the government admitted in court to improperly deporting to a Salvadoran prison. But at the same time, the high court noted that district court judges must also be deferential to the executive branch\u2019s authority over foreign policy.",
      "Similarly, the high court said the administration must allow deportees under the Alien Enemies Act a reasonable chance to fight their removal through habeas corpus petitions. The justices have not yet weighed in on the merits of Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, one of his most aggressive deportation tactics, which the president employed to swiftly remove alleged Tren de Aragua members.",

      "As an example, Severino pointed to the Supreme Court recently allowing Trump to fire Biden-appointed FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a case that the high court is now using as a vehicle to revisit in the coming months the 90-year precedent set by Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States.",
      "Severino said, \"If one assumes, \u2018Okay, if Trump's right,\u2019 then this is a serious burden on the government to have a good chunk of their four years being taken up with not being able to actually staff the government as they want to. If Trump\u2019s wrong, then Commissioner Slaughter should have been in that position, and they can remedy that by providing her back pay.\"",
      "\"When you're balancing those types of harms, this is the kind of case where the government's going to have a leg up,\" Severino said.",
      "In a small defeat for Trump on Wednesday, the Supreme Court declined to allow the president to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and instead said it would hear her case in January. The move was a deviation from the court's typical posture and underscored its unique view on the Federal Reserve compared with other agencies.",

The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "How the FileFix attack works",
      "As reported by researchers at Acronis,\u00a0a leading cybersecurity and data protection company, the attack begins with a phishing page that looks like a message from Meta's support team, claiming that your account will be disabled in seven days unless you view an \"incident report.\" Instead of providing an actual document, the page disguises a malicious PowerShell command as a file path.",
      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",

      "It also targets messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Pidgin, along with cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Exodus. StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",
      "Acronis reported that the campaign has already appeared in several different versions over a short period, with changes in payloads and infrastructure. This suggests that the attackers are actively testing and refining their methods to avoid detection and improve success rates.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from FileFix attacks",
      "To stay protected against attacks like FileFix and prevent malware such as StealC from stealing sensitive information, you need to combine caution with practical security measures. The following steps can help safeguard accounts, devices, and personal data.",
      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",
      "FileFix relies on convincing you to paste hidden PowerShell commands disguised as file paths. Never paste commands into system dialogs, File Explorer, or terminals unless you are absolutely certain of their origin.",
      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts. By using data removal services, you reduce the amount of sensitive personal information that can be found online or left exposed on old platforms. This minimizes what attackers can exploit if they manage to gain access.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A strong antivirus software can detect malware like StealC before it fully executes. Many solutions now include behavior-based detection that can flag suspicious scripts or hidden downloads, helping catch threats even when attackers try to disguise commands as harmless actions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Google has released an urgent update for its Chrome browser to fix a newly discovered zero-day security flaw that hackers are already exploiting. This is the sixth zero-day Chrome has faced this year, highlighting just how quickly attackers move to take advantage of these hidden weaknesses.",

      "Chrome users are urged to update immediately to block active zero-day attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A critical flaw in Chrome's V8 engine",
      "The newly patched vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, stems from a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered and reported the bug on Tuesday, and the company shipped a fix the following day, Bleeping Computer reported.",
      "Google confirmed that the flaw was being exploited in the wild, though it did not share technical details or name the groups behind the attacks. TAG has a history of uncovering zero-days tied to government-sponsored spyware campaigns aimed at high-risk individuals such as opposition leaders, journalists and dissidents.",
      "The fix was delivered through Chrome version 140.0.7339.185/.186 for Windows and macOS, and version 140.0.7339.185 for Linux. These updates will gradually reach all users in the Stable Desktop channel over the coming weeks.",
      "While Chrome typically updates automatically, you can apply the patch immediately by navigating to the \u2018About Google Chrome\u2019 section.

      "This marks the sixth zero-day flaw patched in Chrome this year. In March, Google addressed CVE-2025-2783, a sandbox escape bug exploited in espionage attacks against Russian organizations. In May, it pushed emergency updates for CVE-2025-4664, which let attackers hijack user accounts.",
      "Then in June, another flaw in the V8 engine, CVE-2025-5419, was patched after being spotted by TAG. July saw the release of a fix for CVE-2025-6558, which allowed attackers to bypass Chrome's sandbox protection.

      "Updating Chrome is essential, but there are additional steps you can take to stay safe from attacks.",
      "Many zero-day attacks are delivered through malicious websites or email attachments. Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files from unverified sources, especially if they prompt you to disable security settings. Also, use strong antivirus software to add another layer of defense to detect malicious code that tries to run through compromised browsers. A strong antivirus can spot suspicious activity before it takes hold. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Even if attackers manage to steal your login details through a browser exploit,\u00a02FA makes it much harder for them to break into your accounts. Use an authenticator app instead of SMS when possible for stronger protection.",
      "If attackers exploit the browser to steal login data, a password manager keeps your credentials safe and helps generate unique, complex passwords. Even if one account is targeted, it prevents a domino effect across your logins.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Some extensions can be abused to make attacks worse. Stick to extensions from trusted developers, review permissions carefully and uninstall anything you no longer need.",
      "Chrome updates are critical, but attackers can also exploit holes in Windows, macOS, Android or iOS. Regular OS updates patch vulnerabilities across the system, reducing the chances of a browser exploit spreading further.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The fact that Chrome has already faced six zero-day attacks this year shows how relentless attackers are and how even the most popular software can have serious gaps. These flaws are not just bugs, but opportunities for hackers to exploit millions of users before fixes roll out. The pattern also highlights the growing sophistication of threat actors, including state-backed groups targeting high-risk individuals. No browser is completely safe, and the battle to secure widely used software is ongoing and far from over.",

      "'Cyberguy' Kurt Knutsson breaks down OpenAI's added parental controls after a teen allegedly was encouraged to commit suicide and offers advice for parents to help their kids and teens navigate ChatGPT safely.",
      "ChatGPT could soon alert police when teens discuss suicide. OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman revealed the change during a recent interview. ChatGPT, the widely used artificial intelligence chatbot that can answer questions and hold conversations, has become a daily tool for millions. His comments mark a major shift in how the AI company may handle mental health crises.",

      "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc. (Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why OpenAI is considering police alerts",
      "Altman said,\u00a0\"It's very reasonable for us to say in cases of young people talking about suicide, seriously, where we cannot get in touch with the parents, we do call authorities.\"",
      "Until now, ChatGPT's response to suicidal thoughts has been to suggest hotlines. This new policy signals a move from passive suggestions to active intervention.",
      "Altman admitted the change comes at a cost to privacy. He stressed that user data is important, but acknowledged that preventing tragedy must come first.",
      "Teens can easily access ChatGPT on a mobile device. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Tragedies that prompted action",
      "The shift follows lawsuits tied to teen suicides. The most high-profile case involves 16-year-old Adam Raine of California. His family alleges ChatGPT provided a \"step-by-step playbook\" for suicide, including instructions for tying a noose and even drafting a goodbye note.",
      "After Raine's death in April, his parents sued OpenAI. They argued that the company failed to stop its AI from guiding their son toward harm.",
      "Another lawsuit accused rival chatbot Character.AI of negligence. A 14-year-old reportedly took his own life after forming an intense connection with a bot modeled on a TV character. Together, these cases highlight how quickly teens can form unhealthy bonds with AI.",
      "Adam Raine, a California teen, took his life in April 2025 amid claims ChatGPT coached him (Raine Family)",
      "How widespread is the problem?",
      "Altman pointed to global numbers to justify stronger measures. He noted that about 15,000 people take their own lives each week worldwide. With 10% of the world using ChatGPT, he estimated that around 1,500 suicidal individuals may interact with the chatbot weekly.",
      "Research backs up concerns about teen reliance on AI. A Common Sense Media survey found 72% of U.S. teens use AI tools, with one in eight seeking mental health support from them.",

Your email provider can use them to refine their spam detection algorithms. The best course of action is to report them, so providers can develop better ways to identify harmful or unwanted messages.

Furthermore, your failure to contribute to this improvement means the problem persists not only for you but for others.",

      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",

      "Glassboro district becomes first in U.S. to pair AI gun detection with mass alerts. (Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms. While no system is perfect, this integration builds confidence that schools are investing in stronger defenses.",

The Glassboro rollout demonstrates how technology can detect threats and share critical information in seconds. While no solution eliminates every risk, this approach gives schools more time to react when lives are at stake.",

      "When you search Google for apps, it feels natural to trust the first results you see. They're supposed to be the most reliable, right? Unfortunately, hackers know this too. They're sneaking fake websites into search results that look just like the real thing. If you click and download from one of these sites, you could end up with malware instead of the app you wanted. In other words, the top search results aren't always safe, and that's exactly how scammers trick people.",

      "What you need to know about malware in Google searches",
      "Researchers at FortiGuard Labs found that attackers are setting up websites that look almost identical to trusted providers. These sites host installers for apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Deepl, Chrome, Telegram, Line, VPN services and WPS Office. The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",
      "Once you run one, the malware drops files into your system, asks for administrator access and quietly starts spying. It can collect personal information, log everything you type, monitor your screen and even disable your antivirus.",
      "Hackers are planting fake apps in Google search results and they look just like the real thing. (Harun Ozalp /Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Some versions were designed to snoop on Telegram messages. All of this is possible because hackers use a tactic called SEO poisoning, which manipulates Google's search results so their fake websites appear near the top. Even if you stick to \"safe-looking\" search links, you could still land on a fraudulent page.",
      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from malware in Google Searches",
      "I have listed some steps below that you can take to protect yourself from these fake apps and the malware they carry.",
      "The safest way to avoid malware is to get software directly from the official website or verified app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store. Avoid third-party download sites or search results that look suspicious, even if they appear at the top of Google.",
      "Before clicking \"download,\" carefully inspect the domain name. Hackers often create lookalike domains that look nearly identical to real ones, adding small spelling changes or extra words. Even small differences can indicate a fake site designed to deliver malware.",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

It's not something that just started with the advent of the Syrian civil war,\" Gregg Roman, Executive Director of the Middle East Forum, told Fox News Digital. \"They took 40 years of relations and eventually turned that into an enterprise.\"",
      "Iran has used Shia militant forces from not only Syria, but Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, to construct a \"parallel military infrastructure\" in coordination with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that has transformed Syria into an \"Iranian forward operating base.\"",
      "According to an investigative report compiled by the Middle East Forum, using on-the-ground sources embedded in Iranian military installations across Syria since 2018, Iran has not only constructed underground tunnels and weapons depots for its disposal. Tehran has embedded itself deeply into the everyday lives of Syrians through an integrated system that has blended military duties with civil programs.",

      "\"Perhaps most concerning is the precedent established by Iran\u2019s success in constructing this shadow empire,\" the report found. \"The ability to build parallel military infrastructure, operate independently of host government control, and maintain strategic capabilities despite international scrutiny provides a template that could be replicated elsewhere in the region.\"",
      "Though its strategy may be slightly different, Iran has repeatedly used power vacuums to extend its reach and counter U.S. influence, as seen in both Afghanistan, where it backed the Taliban, and in Iraq, where it began backing Shia militia groups fighting the U.S. as early as 2003.",

      "Roggio said there are hundreds of thousands of Iran-backed militants in Iraq who are largely a part of the Popular Mobilization Forces, which were heavily influential in fighting ISIS and are a part of the Iraqi Armed Forces under the command of the prime minister, but which are also heavily influenced by Tehran.",

And these militias also have economic power,\" Roggio said. \"Iran built these militia forces along the same lines as Hezbollah, and they essentially want them to ultimately become like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is in Iran.\"",
      "Both Roman and Roggio expressed concern over the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region and, more significantly, the removal of U.S. influence at a time when Iran is looking to heavily counter Washington and its interests.",
      "\"We haven't learned the lessons of Afghanistan and even the lessons of Iraq,\" Roggio said. \"I don't care if we have 100 or 100,000 troops in Afghanistan or anywhere else. Do we have the right troops to achieve the mission that we put out for them?",

A photo from Israel's foreign ministry showed Thunberg, the most prominent of the flotilla's passengers, accompanied by soldiers following the interception.

      "More than 6,800 book bans were enacted during the 2024-25 school year in 87 public school districts across 23 states, according to a report released Wednesday by PEN America, a nonprofit that advocates for free expression. The report was released ahead of Banned Books Week, which starts Sunday.",
      "\u201cCensorship pressures have expanded and escalated,\u201d Kasey Meehan, director of PEN America\u2019s Freedom to Read program, said in a news release. \u201cA disturbing \u2018everyday banning\u2019 and normalization of censorship has worsened and spread over the last four years.\u201d",

Lo, whose book \u201cLast Night at the Telegraph Club\u201d was No. 4 on PEN America\u2019s new list, said on Instagram that her 2021 novel made the cut \u201cpartly because all of the usual titles like \u2018Gender Queer\u2019 have already been banned and removed.\u201d",

    "summary": "\u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service, came at an inflection point for the NHS.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Despite being headlined by a genuine star and staged at one of London\u2019s premier theaters, a play about the foundation of a sprawling and troubled public service seemed unlikely to provoke night after night of standing ovations.",
      "But that\u2019s what happened with \u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service.",
      "The play, written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris, came at an inflection point for the NHS, as it\u2019s known. Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

      "A month into the NFL season, one team \u2014 Team A, let\u2019s call it \u2014 has yet to gain more yards than any of its opponents.",
      "Team A\u2019s passing offense is ghastly. Last week, its rarely thrown-to star receiver posted a cryptic message on Twitter after the team failed to complete a single pass after halftime. Another MVP-level offensive weapon isn\u2019t producing as expected, either. And statistically speaking, its defense ranks around average.",
      "Those might sound like the hallmarks of a team going nowhere. But Team A isn\u2019t the 0-4 Jets, Titans or Saints, or the stunningly 1-3 Ravens, either.",
      "It\u2019s the Philadelphia Eagles, who have followed a Super Bowl title last season with a 4-0 start to the new season. They join Buffalo as the lone undefeated teams entering Week 5.",
      "These are the same Eagles who have won 20 of their last 21 games and whose 12-game home winning streak is the second longest in franchise history, since nearly World War II.",
      "By their record, the Eagles are unblemished. Yet that doesn\u2019t mean it has come without drama.",
      "Much of it has been sparked by whether they have a dynamic enough offense to repeat as champions.",
      "When quarterback Jalen Hurts went 0-for-8 after halftime last week against previously unbeaten Tampa Bay, star receiver A.J. Brown posted on X a Scripture passage: \u201cIf you\u2019re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don\u2019t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.\u201d",
      "Did Brown intimate he wanted to be on his way out of town, after averaging just 3.5 catches per game?",
      "Nick Sirianni, the team\u2019s head coach, said he didn\u2019t doubt Brown\u2019s willingness to be an Eagle and a \u201cgood teammate.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe wants to contribute into these wins, and he\u2019s had a couple games where he hasn\u2019t been able to, for different reasons of why we haven\u2019t in these games,\u201d Sirianni said.",
      "Brown later deleted the post and said it was not directed toward anyone specific.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of talent on offense, and, to be honest, defense and special teams have been low-key carrying us,\u201d Brown said Wednesday, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.",
      "\u201cWe need to clean up what we need to clean up and get on the same page and play to the ability that we say we can, and be who we are called to be. It\u2019s a standard that we preach. So it\u2019s easy to have that frustration. I think it\u2019s fair to have that frustration. But I just can\u2019t let that boil over.\u201d",
      "Yet the fact remains that no offense has gained fewer first downs via passes than the Eagles, who have also completed the league\u2019s third-fewest passes. They are averaging 6.0 yards per pass attempt, which is nearly two yards behind last season\u2019s average. A passing game that brought back most of the players who helped produce 12 explosive plays of 40-plus yards last season, tied for second most, has generated just one in four games. The offense is run by a first-year coordinator, after his predecessor, Kellen Moore, parlayed last season\u2019s Super Bowl run into a head coaching job in New Orleans. But Brown\u2019s post also rekindled speculation about the strength of the working relationship between Brown and quarterback Jalen Hurts \u2014 a topic of debate for two years in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Hurts told reporters this week.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not gonna analyze or speculate\u201d about Brown\u2019s post, Hurts said. \u201cHe\u2019s always willing to contribute, and that remains.\u201d",
      "The kinks in the passing offense wouldn\u2019t be as worrisome if the Eagles\u2019 vaunted running game weren\u2019t also enduring its own. The combination has led to Jekyll-and-Hyde performances where the offense has sometimes looked explosive, and sometimes produced zilch.",
      "\u201cWe got to be more consistent,\u201d Sirianni said this week.",
      "While turning the \u201cTush Push\u201d quarterback sneak into a nearly unstoppable (and nearly banned) weapon in short-yardage situations, and blocking for running back Saquon Barkley as he became only the ninth 2,000-yard rusher in NFL history last season, the Eagles\u2019 offensive line earned a reputation as the NFL\u2019s very best. This season, however, three players are coming off either offseason surgery or playing through injury, while a fourth is in his first season as starter.",
      "Last season, that line created so much room for Barkley to run that he gained an average of 3.8 yards before being hit, the highest of any running back, according to Pro Football Reference. This season, that average has dropped to 1.7 yards before contact, and Barkley has had defenders in his face much more quickly.",
      "Through four games, Barkley has gained half as many yards per carry than at the same point last season. And Barkley, last season\u2019s offensive player of the year, has yet to gain more than 100 yards from scrimmage in a single game.",
      "\u201cWhen the running game is going bad, I\u2019ve got to own it,\u201d Barkley said after last week\u2019s win in Tampa. \u201cThe beauty of it is we\u2019re not running the ball too great and we\u2019re 4-0.\u201d",
      "What else we\u2019re watching for in Week 5:",
      "Minnesota (2-2) vs. Cleveland (1-3): The league\u2019s third international game this season, in London, is the backdrop for Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel\u2019s first career start after replacing Joe Flacco. The last Browns quarterback to win in his first start was Eric Zeier in 1995.",
      "Denver (2-2) at Philadelphia (4-0): The Broncos have lost five consecutive road games dating to last season but lead the league with 15 sacks.",
      "Las Vegas (1-3) at Indianapolis (3-1): The Colts could become the first team since 1945 to go three consecutive home games without a punt. The Raiders, meanwhile, have lost seven straight games against winning teams.",
      "Houston (1-3) at Baltimore (1-3): Division winners from last season who harbored similar playoff aspirations this year find themselves in a world of trouble. The Texans are coming off only their third shutout in franchise history. Baltimore\u2019s Derrick Henry is one rushing touchdown from tying Walter Payton (110) for the fifth most in NFL history.",
      "Giants (1-3) at New Orleans (0-4): After a win in his first career start, Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart will try to end his team\u2019s seven-game losing streak on the road. His Saints counterpart, Spencer Rattler, is 0-10 for his career.",
      "Dallas (1-2-1) at Jets (0-4): The good: The Cowboys lead the NFL with 404.3 yards per game. The bad: Their defense has allowed even more, ranking dead last. The Jets have yet to force a turnover \u2014 the only team yet to do so.",
      "Miami (1-3) at Carolina (1-3): The Panthers recommitted to Bryce Young as the starter. All three of their losses have been on the road. Miami is 21-8 against teams with losing records under coach Mike McDaniel.",
      "Tampa Bay (3-1) at Seattle (3-1): Can Seattle end its struggles at home? Since 2022, the Buccaneers have lost six straight games when playing without receiver Mike Evans, who will miss this game with a hamstring injury.",
      "Tennessee (0-4) at Arizona (2-2): The Titans are trying to avoid their first 0-5 start since 2009, while the Cardinals have lost two straight.",
      "Washington (2-2) at Chargers (3-1): Chargers running back Omarion Hampton leads all rookies with 380 yards from scrimmage this season; that includes 110 through the air. The Commanders are 0-2 on the road.",
      "Detroit (3-1) at Cincinnati (2-2): While it\u2019s obvious the Bengals would struggle without quarterback Joe Burrow, they\u2019ve also become the first team since the 2009 Raiders to fail to gain more than 200 yards in three of their first four games.",
      "New England (2-2) at Buffalo (4-0): Josh Allen has 34 touchdowns and two turnovers in his last 13 games. If the Bills win, they\u2019ll be 5-0 for the first time since 1991.",
      "Kansas City (2-2) at Jacksonville (3-1) on Monday: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for more touchdowns (four) last week than he had in his first three games combined. The Jaguars have forced a league-best 13 turnovers."

Emily Blunt stars as Kerr\u2019s first wife, Dawn Staples.",
      "\u201cMark was the greatest fighter in the world at one point, but this film is not even really about fighting \u2014 it\u2019s a love story,\u201d Johnson said at the festival. \u201cIt\u2019s a love story about Mark and Dawn in this relationship, and it\u2019s a love story about Mark and the love that he had for the thing that he did \u2014 his struggle with trying to deliver (in the ring), his challenges and his overcoming.\u201d",

      "\u201cI was in Vancouver for the set and I was laughing with Benny about it going, \u2018Alright, who came up with the pyramid?\u2019\u201d Kerr recalled during a Sept. 25 appearance on the \u201cJoe Rogan Experience\u201d podcast. \u201cThe door opening with the fog machines?\u2019...But they reproduced it to a T.\u201d",

      "As the film depicts, following his UFC wins, Kerr headed to Japan to compete in the MMA promotion Pride Fighting Championships. According to the UFC, Kerr won six of his first eight fights in Pride as a heavyweight.",
      "He did have his losses, which are seen in the movie, that also triggered his health struggles. One fight in particular, against Igor Vovchanchyn, ended in a no-contest, which set him over the edge.",
      "\"That was the straw that literally set me over the top,\" Kerr told Johnson in a joint interview for Sports Illustrated.",
      "Amid his success in the ring, his life behind closed doors proved to be quite the opposite.",
      "His Struggles With Addiction and Overdose",
      "As depicted in the film, Kerr struggled with addiction and took painkillers that were prescribed to him by a doctor. He began using opioids regularly to be able to continue fighting and numb the blows in the ring.",
      "In a 2024 interview on the HJR Podcast, Kerr explained when he believes his addiction started.",
      "\u201cThe two components that came together are the expectation that I\u2019m supposed to perform at this level regardless,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the training to perform at that level. And when those two came together, it just created a storm where I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t have time.\u201d",

      "The film also depicted a the real-life moment when Dawn attempted to kill herself with a gun after Mark told her to leave their home. Kerr confirmed the moment in his HBO documentary, as well as in an interview with Time.com, sharing that Staples also attempted to hurt herself with razors before grabbing the handgun.",
      "\u201cWhat I was doing at the time was incredibly selfish. Dawn just wanted my love. She wanted to feel important. The only thing important at the time was me fighting, then the second thing that came in importance was the drug and alcohol use,\u201d Kerr said about his and Staples fights. \u201cA lot of that volatility was because of my actions. I look back on it now, she\u2019s a little girl asking to be loved, and I\u2019m just a little boy that doesn\u2019t know how to accept or give it.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt was therapy for me... For the first time, I could actually see my part in it,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I could see my part, how f------ hard I was on the people around me, how just singularly driven I was to accomplish something at all cost. And the person that paid it the most was Dawn. She paid a heavy price.\u201d",
      "In another interview with IndieWire, Kerr reflected on his and his ex-wife's relationship.",
      "\u201cIt allowed me to see how hard I was on Dawn, and really admit that to myself,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cFighting is incredibly selfish; it doesn\u2019t leave a lot of space for other people when it comes to emotion and intimacy. Breaking it down to its essence, Dawn was just a little girl who wanted to be loved, and I was just a boy that couldn\u2019t figure out how to love her.\u201d",
      "He expressed that both of them are different people now and their priority in life is their \u201cbeautiful 20-year-old son\u201d and \u201cto be the best parents we can to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the movie showed at Venice, I couldn\u2019t believe how emotionally impactful it was,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was like therapy with a thousand people in the room. It was a beautiful experience.\u201d",

      "\"I\u2019ve always felt that if you wanna try and inhabit somebody convincingly that it seems sensible that there wouldn\u2019t be too much \u2014 that people wouldn\u2019t have an impression of you as an individual that would in some way inhibit your ability to do that,\" Murphy said.",
      "\"That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve always felt,\" he continued. \"I like the transformative nature of acting. So if you can kinda keep that as background, then I think it allows you more freedom as a performer, you know?\"",
      "Murphy made a name for himself in roles like Christopher Nolan's  \"Batman Begins\" and \"Inception,\" and the popular series \"Peaky Blinders.\" When he landed the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan's epic film, \"Oppenheimer,\" he not took home an Oscar, but also became more of a household name.",
      "The three-hour film won seven Oscars, including the Academy Award for best picture and Murphy's Oscar for best actor in a leading role.",
      "Since the release of \"Oppenheimer,\" Murphy has gone on to star in the Zombie movie, \"28 Days Later,\" and \"Small Things Like These,\" a film adaptation of Irish author Claire Keegan's book of the same name.",
      "That film follows an Irish father in the 1980s as he discovers abuse occurring at a local convent's Magdalene Laundry. At laundries across the country, \"fallen women\" were forced into unpaid labor until the last laundry closed in 1996, according to the BBC.",
      "Murphy described learning of the scandal as a \"collective trauma for people of a certain age\" at a 2024 press conference, according to the Guardian.",
      "\u201cI think the irony of the book is that it\u2019s a Christian man trying to act Christian in a dysfunctional Christian society. And it asks a lot of questions about publicity and silence and shame, all of those things,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think the duty of art is to answer those questions, it\u2019s to talk to them. And maybe it\u2019s easier to absorb than an academic report, or a political report.\u201d",
      "Murphy's newest role is in Netflix's \"Steve,\" in which he portrays the titular role of a headteacher at a school for boys with societal and behavioral issues. \"Steve\" is set to premiere on Oct. 3."

      "During his Aug. 31 episode of \u201cSunday Sitdown\u201d with Willie Geist, Bad Bunny reacted to Hamm\u2019s dancing during his performance. At the time he said, \u201cI saw him there on the casita probably, he was lit. I\u2019m happy that he went and he had fun.\u201d"

      "\u201cI remember right when we were about to start the press tour, Paul and Leo were like, \u2018Hey, we need you to get on Tiktok and you start making TikToks.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018OK, you guys are going to have to be in them too.

      "Eventually, Infiniti explains, \u201cthe more that we did it, the more that they enjoyed them.\"",
      "The real test of success was when she was given a thumbs up of approval by Anderson\u2019s kids, whom he shares with actor Maya Rudolph.",

      "As far as where the story may go for her character\u2019s dad Bob, Infiniti jokes she hopes he finally gets the help he needs.",
      "\u201cI hope Bob does not stay as paranoid,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that my biggest hope for Bob is that he can actually, like, sit on the couch and chill. He doesn\u2019t have to be as paranoid as he has been in the past.\u201d",

      "Here's what to know about Henry and Ed Gein.",
      "Who were Henry and Ed Gein?",
      "Henry and Ed Gein were the two children born to Augusta and George Gein in Wisconsin in the early 1900s \u2014 Henry in 1902 and Ed in 1906.",
      "The Gein biography \"Deviant,\" written by the true crime writer Harold Schechter, describes Augusta as a \"domestic tyrant\" and a woman of strict religious conviction, bordering on \"madness.\"",
      "RELATED: Who Was Ed Gein\u2019s Mother, Augusta? All About the Woman Who Raised a \u2018Monster\u2019",
      "The boys grew up on a remote farm, six miles outside of Plainfield, per the book. There, she handled her sons' \"religious and moral training.\" She emphasized, to her sons, the \"wickedness of modern women.\"",
      "What Happened Between Ed and Henry Gein?",
      "Schechter wrote that the boys had a \"good relationship,\" but disagreed on one thing: their mom.",
      "Henry Gein once confronted Ed Gein about their mother, raising \u201csome serious questions about her hold over her younger son.\u201d",
      "Ed Gein, in response, was \u201castonished\u201d to learn his brother didn\u2019t also regard their mother as a \u201csaint on earth.\u201d",
      "\u201cHenry\u2019s implied criticism of Augusta came as a real shock to Eddie,\u201d Schechter wrote.",
      "This conversation is seemingly depicted in \u201cMonster.\u201d Standing with Ed in a barn, Henry lays out his plan to leave the family, find freedom from their controlling mother and marry the woman he loves, of whom Augusta disapproves",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t do the religion no more. The cage she built for herself, Ed. She\u2019s trapped in it. Look at me. Right in the eye. You\u2019re gonna get trapped in it, too. Listen to me. I\u2019m getting out of here. I\u2019m leaving you. Do you understand?\u201d Henry says.",
      "He also urges Ed to leave Augusta's grip, too, saying, \"You need to get out of here too. Mother is sick. She\u2019s a sick woman.\u201d",
      "He also seems to pick up on the route Ed is going down, saying, \"You\u2019ve always been a peculiar type. Mother\u2019s making you very strange. I hate to see you like that.\u201d",
      "Ed, meanwhile, is resistant to anyone going against his mom. \"I don't want to hear that. Don't talk like that about her,\" he says.",
      "Did Ed Gein Really Kill His Brother?",
      "In the show, Ed fatally strikes his brother with a log after the conversation. Ed then imagines him standing up and saying he changed his mind about Augusta \u2013\u00a0but in actuality, he's dead. Ed later drags Henry's frozen body out into a marsh and starts a fire.",
      "Schechter, in \"Deviant,\" wrote about the mystery of Henry Gein's death at the age of 43. The \"single indisputable fact\" about Henry Gein's death was that it happened May 16, 1944. The rest? Up to debate.",
      "It did happen after the brothers were taking care of a fire on marshland near their home, Schechter wrote. Ed Gein later said that when the fire got out of control, he was separated from his brother. Later, he led a search to find Henry Gein \u2014 and led investigators right to the spot where his brother lay.",
      "\"Several odd things immediately struck the searchers. First, though the corpse was stretched out on a scorched piece of ground, there were no signs that Henry had been injured by the flames. His clothes were soot-covered but otherwise undamaged, and the exposed part of his body was similarly free of burns,\" Schechter wrote.",
      "They also notice that Ed Gein's story didn't align: Before, he couldn't find his brother, but he led searchers directly there.",
      "Henry Gein's cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation and the coroner decided a further inquest was not necessary.",
      "Their mother died the following year.",
      "Ed Gein never confessed to killing his brother but, in 1957, did confess to murdering two women: Beatrice Worden, a local hardware store owner, and Mary Hogan, a tavern operator."

      "During an interview on Capital FM on Oct. 3, Swift confirmed that \"Opalite\" is Kelce's favorite song off the new album and explained how his birthstone inspired the track.",
      "\"I have favorite words, favorite phrases, things that I\u2019ll put in an endless file of lyrics that I\u2019m just constantly going to go and cherry pick from when I\u2019m writing.

      "'Elizabeth Taylor'",
      "Elizabeth Taylor, who was married seven times, knew a thing or two about high-profile relationships. In this song named after the late actor, Swift sings, \"Elizabeth Taylor, do you think it\u2019s forever?\" as she talks about a relationship.",

      "In the song, Swift talks about a man who worships her while others criticize her. She also expresses her fears of losing their love.",

      "Despite the fact that Taylor Swift was also at her home that night, Cox right away noticed the band's guitarist Johnny McDaid, who would later become her boyfriend.",
      "\"I remember seeing (McDaid), and I thought, 'Oh, he\u2019s a really handsome guy.' But we didn\u2019t have this moment at all. And then later on he asked me out,\" she shared.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly backed the peace plan, which includes the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas, during a visit to the White House last week.",
      "Hamas has expressed a willingness to release all hostages, alive or dead, and plans to send a team on Sunday to Cairo, where more in-depth negotiations are slated to begin on Monday.

      "There are ongoing talks to determine logistically how hostages could be released, he said.",
      "\u201cYou have to make sure the Red Cross can get there, what time they\u2019re going to be there, where they\u2019re going to be,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAll that has to be worked through.\u201d",
      "Asked whether hostages could be released as early as this week, Rubio said, \u201cWe want it to be as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that Israel agreed to withdraw to an initial line cutting through Gaza in order for the hostage deal to move forward. The initial withdrawal line, marked by a yellow line in a graphic posted by Trump, would withdraw the Israeli military to the outskirts of several major cities.",
      "Before Israel withdraws further, Rubio noted that the parties had to determine who would take control of the territory.",
      "\u201cWhen we ask Israel, \u2018OK, you\u2019re at the yellow line, now everything behind it you have to turn it over,\u2019 You have to have somebody to turn it over to,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo, I mean, let\u2019s be realistic here.

      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

      "But two that have eluded him potentially mean the most to his legacy and his dogged pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The first is the Russia-Ukraine war, which is no closer to ending now than when Trump took office in January. The other is Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Here, he may have just achieved a breakthrough.",
      "Up against a Sunday deadline that Trump had set, Hamas said Friday that it would meet a major condition that the president laid out in his 20-point plan for the war\u2019s end: releasing all the hostages, living or dead. Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",
      "Hamas also said it was prepared to enter into negotiations and turn over administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of technocrats.",
      "Trump had been waiting on an answer from Hamas since Monday, when he released his peace plan at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He took Hamas\u2019 announcement as a good sign.",
      "\u201cBased on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cIsrael must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!\u201d",
      "Ruby Chen, a hostage family member and a leading advocate, told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive \u2014 we have cautious optimism. We know the president cares a lot about the hostages, so let\u2019s hope this is our time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not done. There are still a lot of missing pieces, but it\u2019s positive,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump posted a video on Truth Social on Friday night in response to Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying: \u201cThis is a big day. We\u2019ll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete.\u201d",
      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",
      "Like Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and others before him, Trump is working to negotiate an accord among longtime combatants \u2014 an effort that dovetails with the White House\u2019s public campaign to get him the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "\u201cIf not now, when?\u201d said Richard Goldberg, who served on the National Security Council staff in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Even some of Trump\u2019s detractors said that Hamas\u2019 new position could be an encouraging step toward ending the war.",
      "\u201cLike the rest of the world, I\u2019m hoping this news means imminent return of the hostages and action addressing the Gaza humanitarian crisis, along with a ceasefire and path to peace and normalizing relations in the region,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News.",
      "Some were more skeptical, questioning whether Hamas can be trusted to follow through on its commitments.",
      "Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cI\u2019d be a bit more cautious given that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a track record of saying one thing and doing another.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do,\u201d said a former Western diplomat with experience in the Middle East. \u201cHamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases. Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "A European diplomat who has been closely engaged in the process said the situation remained extremely urgent: \u201cGet the hostages home. Worry about the details next.\u201d",
      "The diplomat acknowledged that as with any deal of this kind, the details and terms need to be worked out as the process moves forward.",
      "Even if Trump succeeds where his predecessors failed and creates conditions for Palestinians and Israelis to live together peacefully, a Nobel Peace Prize would still be a long shot.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Trump administration for launching deadly attacks on alleged foreign drug boats. Though he has embraced the title \u201cPresident of Peace,\u201d Trump just rebranded the Defense Department as the \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d",
      "The prize is awarded each year by five appointees of Norway\u2019s parliament. During Trump\u2019s first term, one member of parliament, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, was at the hairdresser waiting for his wife when his cellphone rang.",
      "Trump was calling.",
      "With the hair dryers whirring, Tybring-Gjedde said he had trouble hearing. The president thanked him for nominating him for the prize, Tybring-Gjedde said in an interview.",
      "Earlier this summer, Trump called another Norwegian, former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and during the conversation also brought up the prize.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure he [Trump] really understands how this is done,\u201d Tybring-Gjedde said. \u201cThe Norwegian government has nothing to do with the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d",
      "A phone call may not sway anyone, but the Nobel judges would be hard-pressed to defy a president who brokered a Middle East peace deal at long last, Trump\u2019s supporters say.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting if he does pull it off how the Nobel committee manages to ignore the fact that he did it,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican ally of the president, told NBC News."

In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",

      "The public feud over the meeting has only deepened tensions at a moment when the family is seeking to project unity, and it could set back attempts to mend the relationship, according to NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew.",

      "Harry had earlier sounded eager to build on the brief tea, emphasizing his desire to spend more time with his father while defending his tell-all memoir in an interview with Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper following that trip to the U.K.",
      "The accusations from Harry\u2019s camp came just a week after the family showcased its finest pomp and pageantry during Trump\u2019s state visit \u2014 a triumph quickly overshadowed by a return to all-too-familiar controversy.",
      "While Trump\u2019s trip was only briefly marred by the Epstein scandal, the subject was soon back on newspaper front pages with new royal revelations.",
      "The king has instructed Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, that they will not be welcome at the royal Christmas, according to weekend reports in Britain\u2019s Telegraph and Sunday Times newspapers that cited multiple sources.",
      "Buckingham Palace did not respond to requests for comment on the report and on the statement from Harry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "That comes after Ferguson was dropped as a patron by a number of charities following a newly surfaced email that revealed she had referred to Epstein as a \u201csupreme friend,\u201d despite the disgraced financier\u2019s conviction on sex offenses. A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her and accuse her of defamation.",
      "The disclosure reignited scrutiny of royal ties to Epstein, long centered on Andrew.",
      "The palace will hope, McAndrew said, that something else will \u201ccome along to take the attention away.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem with Andrew is he\u2019s always grabbing the attention back,\u201d she said.",
      "While at odds with itself in recent years, the royal family has also been buffeted by external crises.",
      "William described 2024 as the most challenging year of his life in comments that aired Sunday \u2014 a period that saw both his wife, Kate, the Princess of Wales, and his father undergo cancer treatment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d say 2024 was the hardest year I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said, speaking to \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d star Eugene Levy on his show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "William, the heir to the throne, added: \u201cLife is said to test us as well, and being able to overcome that is what makes us who we are.\u201d"

      "Referring to the flotilla as the \"Hamas-Sumud flotilla,\" the foreign ministry said several vessels had been stopped, with those onboard being transferred to an Israeli port. \"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" it said, adding in a later post that deportation procedures to Europe were expected to begin once passengers arrived in Israel.",
      "Some 500 people have taken part in the Global Sumud Flotilla, seeking to deliver a symbolic aid package to the besieged enclave and send a message of resistance by breaking through Israel's naval blockade of the territory.",

Hamas will be part of it and will contribute to it with full responsibility.\u201d",
      "Under the plan, Israel\u2019s assault in Gaza would end immediately once both sides agree to the proposal, with all hostages, alive and dead, to be released within 72 hours. The plan says no one will be forced to leave Gaza and those who do can return.",
      "A pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood is outlined as a possible outcome, but not a guarantee.",
      "By agreeing to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to an independent body of technocrats, Hamas appears to have agreed to one of the key points of Trump\u2019s plan to relinquish control, but it is still not clear whether it will agree to \u201cnot have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form,\u201d as the plan stipulates.",
      "The Hamas response does not address one critical point: disarmament. Trump\u2019s plan states that Hamas must agree to \u201ca process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning.\u201d This is likely to be one of the major sticking points if negotiations proceed.",
      "Hamas\u2019s response comes as the Israeli military is pressing ahead with a ground operation in famine-stricken Gaza City, despite mounting international pressure and isolation over its assault on the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the Hamas response, according to his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric.",
      "Guterres \u201curges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end,\u201d Dujarric said in a statement.",
      "Qatar and Egypt, both countries involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, also welcomed the Hamas response.",
      "In his video address on Truth Social on Friday, Trump thanked Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan as countries \u201cthat helped me put this together.\u201d",
      "If the deal is consummated, it would represent the clearest foreign policy victory of Trump\u2019s second term so far \u2014 the brokering of a peace agreement that proved elusive for his predecessor, President Joe Biden, and one that he promised he would deliver quickly as he campaigned for the Oval Office in 2024.",
      "During that race, Trump highlighted a deep rift in the Democratic Party over the war that pitted pro-Israel moderates against liberal defenders of Palestinians. Though Trump\u2019s focus on helping negotiate a permanent ceasefire has waxed and waned over the course of his eight-plus months in office, the conflict was never off his radar.",
      "He assigned one of his closest allies, fellow real estate mogul Steve Witkoff, to quarterback the American deal-making team, and he put his own capital on the line in discussions with major players in the region as recently as this week.",
      "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a longtime informal adviser to Trump, said in an interview with NBC News on Friday that the president has held a vision for the Middle East that includes progress for Israel and Arab nations since he first took office in 2017 and that his insistence on wrangling an apology from Netanyahu for Israeli strikes in Qatar demonstrated his commitment to that view.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is, first of all, a very subtle, complex set of relationships being nurtured by the president with a continued emphasis on a better future,\u201d Gingrich said.",
      "If a peace agreement \u201cactually happens,\u201d Gingrich added, it could put Trump in league with President Theodore Roosevelt, who negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese war in the early part of the 20th century, and that \u201cwould have a substantial impact\u201d on the perception of Trump in the U.S.",
      "A senior Arab diplomat told NBC News that the Hamas response is \u201cpositive,\u201d adding: \u201cThey had no choice but to accept.\u201d",
      "But a former Western diplomat with experience in the region told NBC News that the plan could still fall apart.",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do. Hamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cTrump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019s bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan was met with cautious optimism earlier in the week by leaders elsewhere in the Middle East and around the world.",
      "Muslim powers including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey welcomed the plan in a joint statement calling Trump\u2019s efforts \u201csincere.\u201d",
      "The proposal also received support from Europe, with countries that had recently defied Washington by formally recognizing Palestinian statehood welcoming the initiative.",
      "But hours after Trump announced the plan, Netanyahu reiterated his past vows to oppose Palestinian statehood.",
      "\u201cInstead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\u201d he said in Hebrew in a video discussing his U.S. trip.",
      "The developments come on the eve of the second anniversary of the fighting, which began with the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.",
      "According to health officials in the enclave, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in the past two years."

      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

    "published": "Sat, 04 Oct 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Alibaba announced a new initiative aiming to reach AI superintelligence, heating up an arms race with American AI companies.",
    "story": [
      "Early last week in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, a slick, larger-than-life video screen beamed out four words that would drive tech giant Alibaba\u2019s stock to historic levels and signal a shift in China\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence: \u201cRoadmap to Artificial Superintelligence.\u201d",
      "During his 23-minute keynote address at the flagship Alibaba Cloud conference, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu charted out a future featuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI). These terms point to a theorized era in which AI becomes roughly as smart as humans (AGI) and then much, much smarter (ASI).",
      "While these terms have been tossed around Silicon Valley for years, Wu\u2019s presentation was notable: Alibaba is now the first established Chinese tech giant to explicitly invoke AGI and ASI.",
      "\u201cAchieving AGI \u2014 an intelligent system with general human-level cognition \u2014 now appears inevitable. Yet AGI is not the end of AI\u2019s development, but its beginning,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt will march toward ASI \u2014 intelligence beyond the human, capable of self-iteration and continuous evolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cASI will drive exponential technological leaps, carrying us into an unprecedented age of intelligence,\u201d Wu said, highlighting ASI\u2019s ability to help cure diseases, discover cleaner sources of energy and even unlock interstellar travel.",
      "The U.S. and China are the world\u2019s leading AI powers, each with immense computing capabilities and top-tier researchers developing cutting-edge systems. Yet observers have framed the countries as having different approaches to AI, with perceptions that China focuses more on real-world AI applications.",
      "For example, commentators recently argued that Beijing is currently \u201cwinning the race for AI robots\u201d against the U.S., as China is home to much of the world\u2019s most advanced robotics supply chains and a growing network of robotics, or embodied AI, labs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been some commentary in Western media recently about how the U.S. is missing the point by pushing for AGI, while China is focusing solely on applications,\u201d said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome Chinese researchers and some parts of the Chinese government have been interested in AGI and superintelligence for a long time,\u201d Toner said, though she noted this view was primarily held by smaller startups like DeepSeek.",
      "Afra Wang, a researcher focusing on China\u2019s tech scene, said Alibaba\u2019s invocation of AGI and ASI was remarkable.",
      "\u201cThis ASI narrative is definitely something new, especially among the biggest tech companies in China,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s \u201croadmap to artificial superintelligence\u201d seems to scramble mainstream perceptions. Any number of California techno-optimists, like Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei or xAI\u2019s Elon Musk, might have delivered Wu\u2019s speech, selling a technology-enabled utopia while largely sidestepping darker questions about how humanity would co-exist with or survive an era of digital superintelligence.",
      "The concept of superintelligence has long been on the minds of \u2014 if not explicitly guiding \u2014 prominent American AI companies. For example, OpenAI released an article focused on the safe development of superintelligent AI models in May 2023. \u201cNow is a good time to start thinking about the governance of superintelligence \u2014 future AI systems dramatically more capable than even AGI,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The possibility of superintelligence is now even being acknowledged in Congress. On Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Ill., announced a draft bill that would, among other actions, \u201cassist Congress in determining the potential for controlled AI systems to reach artificial superintelligence.\u201d",
      "To some, ASI might seem like an outlandish concept when today\u2019s AI systems fail to understand basic tennis rules, hallucinate or fabricate basic information, or do not seem to actually comprehend how the external world functions.",
      "At the same time, AI systems continue to approach and sometimes surpass human capabilities in many domains, from driving cars safely to winning international coding competitions, leaving many experts to say it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, humans develop digital superintelligence.",
      "As the idea of superintelligence gradually enters mainstream debates, many American politicians have announced that the U.S. is in an AI race with China. The White House\u2019s current AI manifesto is titled \u201cWinning the AI Race: America\u2019s AI Action Plan,\u201d while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proclaimed that \u201cas a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat China in the AI race.\u201d",
      "Yet charges of an AI race are muddied by a lack of an agreed end goal and swirling definitions of AGI. At worst, experts think an unfettered race toward AGI or ASI could lead to widespread catastrophe or even the end of humanity.",
      "But there\u2019s also plenty of skepticism around talk of AGI and ASI and whether it\u2019s primarily for marketing purposes.",
      "Alibaba is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, known for providing powerful, free AI models \u2014 also called open-source models \u2014 for download. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model series, a competitor to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, is the most popular open-source AI system in the world.",
      "Wu announced a new series of Qwen models in his speech last week, including a model that combines text, images, video and audio capabilities.",
      "Many observers point out that narratives about a U.S.-China AI race and a resulting sprint to build AI infrastructure serve AI investors by propping up company valuations and increasing their soft power. Alibaba\u2019s stock has soared since Wu\u2019s speech last week, part of a larger $250 billion comeback this year that has made it China\u2019s hottest AI company.",
      "To unlock a powerful, superintelligent future, Wu predicted that large AI models will replace existing operating systems as the link between users, software and computational power. This future network of large AI models will run on cloud computing networks like Alibaba Cloud, he said.",
      "Irene Zhang, a researcher on China\u2019s AI ecosystem and an editor of ChinaTalk, noted the business undertones of Wu\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a vision of AGI and ASI that\u2019s directly based on Alibaba\u2019s business model,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAlibaba Cloud dominates China\u2019s cloud computing market, and its global market share is now bigger than Oracle\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s commercial strategy and its publicly stated views on ASI/AGI are symbiotic.\u201d",
      "Matt Sheehan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed.",
      "\u201cASI is the ultimate frontier, as far as the discourse goes on AI,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that Alibaba set this grandiose goal, but in reality, they\u2019re selling cloud services.\u201d"

      "Takaichi defeated Shinjiro Koizumi 185 to 156 in a second-round runoff vote to become leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II.",
      "The leadership race was triggered last month when Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he would step down after a year in office. Though Takaichi is likely to succeed him as prime minister of Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes later this month, it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "\u201cRight now, rather than feeling happy, I truly believe this is where the real challenge begins,\u201d Takaichi said in her victory speech. \u201cThere is a mountain of work we must all tackle together.\u201d",
      "She also said it was important to make the LDP, which has been tarnished by corruption scandals, \u201ca more spirited and vibrant party, a party that transforms people\u2019s anxieties into hope.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, 64, a hard-line conservative who says her hero is former British leader Margaret Thatcher, was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader.",
      "Though many party members welcome Takaichi\u2019s ascendance as a potential return to the days of Abe, there are concerns that her nationalistic historical views could cause friction with East Asian neighbors China and South Korea.",
      "\u201cBeijing is likely to object to Takaichi\u2019s positions on revising Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution, strengthening maritime security, and bolstering support for Taiwan,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "One of the top priorities for Japan\u2019s next prime minister will be implementing the trade deal reached with the Trump administration in July. The agreement, which imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods including its crucial auto exports, has yet to be put in writing and many of the details remain unclear.",
      "Takaichi has raised the possibility of reopening talks on the deal, which includes a pledge by Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S.",
      "She told reporters after her victory on Saturday that she did not intend to \u201coverturn\u201d anything that Japan and the United States had agreed upon.",
      "\u201cI will firmly adhere to the agreement reached between our two countries,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cThis applies to tariffs and also investments as well.\u201d",
      "The LDP voted on five leadership candidates in the first round, with Takaichi securing 183 votes to Koizumi\u2019s 164. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, the top spokesperson for the current Japanese government, came in third with 134 votes after a recent surge in polls.",
      "Votes in the first round were divided evenly between 294 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members who were represented by 295 votes. Lawmakers favored the more moderate Koizumi, while party members preferred Takaichi, who has a passionate base.",
      "In the second round, lawmakers had the same number of votes while rank-and-file party members had 47, representing the 47 prefectures of Japan.",
      "Lawmakers in the second round voted 149 to 145 in favor of Takaichi, while party members gave her 36 votes compared with Koizumi\u2019s 11.",
      "Koizumi, 44, the current agriculture minister and the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, would have been Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",

Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",
      "He said Thursday he would do \u201ceverything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\u201d",
      "The necessity of that was evident hours after the incident in Manchester, when two cars drove past the scene displaying Palestinian flags, while some men in balaclavas could be heard muttering about \u201cJews\u201d, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.",
      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
      "On Friday, protesters said they were supporting an urgent cause, specifically the aid flotilla that was intercepted by the Israeli military en route to Gaza.",
      "But for others \u2014 both in and outside the Jewish community \u2014 it was disappointing not to have a pause in the demonstrations that have often been interpreted as hostile by British Jews.",
      "\u201cI do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\u201d Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC. \u201cIt is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home.\u201d"

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Friday that King Charles had approved the nomination of Sarah Mullally, bishop of London, for the church\u2019s most senior position. She will be installed in a service at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.",
      "Mullally is the first female Archbishop of Canterbury to be chosen since women were allowed to become bishops in 2014.",
      "As the spiritual leader of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury heads a global Anglican community of around 85 million people across 165 countries.",
      "In a statement following her appointment, Mullally said: \u201cAs I respond to the call of Christ to this new ministry, I do so in the same spirit of service to God and to others that has motivated me since I first came to faith as a teenager.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt every stage of that journey, through my nursing career and Christian ministry, I have learned to listen deeply \u2014 to people and to God\u2019s gentle prompting \u2014 to seek to bring people together to find hope and healing.\u201d",
      "Mullally became the first female bishop of London in 2018, having first been ordained in 2001. Before joining the church, she had been a specialist cancer nurse, rising to become the government\u2019s youngest chief nursing officer for England at the age of 37.",

      "\u201cThe Church of England is of profound importance to this country. Its churches, cathedrals, schools, and charities are part of the fabric of our communities,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "In an address following her appointment, Mullally said that \u201cin the apparent chaos which surrounds us, in the midst of such profound global uncertainty, the possibility of healing lies in acts of kindness and love.\u201d",
      "She added that Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester showed that Church of England members \u201chave a responsibility to be a people who stand with the Jewish community against antisemitism in all its forms. Hatred and racism of any kind cannot be allowed to tear us apart.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince William has said \u201cchange is on my agenda\u201d and admitted to being overwhelmed by family stress in an unusually candid interview.",
      "William was speaking with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy in Windsor for Levy\u2019s Apple TV+ travel series, \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "Asked if the monarchy would be shifting in a different direction when he becomes king, the Prince of Wales said: \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that change is on my agenda. Change for good, and I embrace that and I enjoy that change. I don\u2019t fear it, that\u2019s the bit that excites me is the idea of being able to bring some change.\u201d",
      "William, heir to the throne currently held by King Charles, did not offer any specific changes he would be interested in making and said he did not want \u201coverly radical change,\u201d but said that \u201cif you\u2019re not careful, history can be a real weight and an anchor around you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this,\u201d he said in a clip from the upcoming episode. \u201cBut there\u2019s also points where you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\u201d",
      "While giving Levy a private tour of Windsor Castle, where King Charles recently hosted a state banquet for President Donald Trump, William said he no longer found his royal duties overwhelming, but admitted that \u201cstuff to do with family overwhelms me quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Speaking over a pint in a local pub, William told the \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d star he was \u201cgenerally a very optimistic person\u201d even in the face of the recent cancer battles faced by his wife, Catherine, and father, King Charles.",

      "Asked how his three children \u2014 George, 12, Charlotte, 10, and Louis, 7 \u2014 have been coping with their mother\u2019s cancer, which is now in remission, William said: \u201cEveryone has their own coping mechanisms for these sorts of things, and children are constantly learning and adapting. We try to make sure we give them the security and the safety that they need. And we\u2019re a very open family, so we talk about things that bother us, and things that trouble us, but you never quite know the knock-on effects that it can have.\u201d",
      "William, who has historically been more averse to the media spotlight than his younger brother, Harry, also discussed how his experience of \u201cinsatiable\u201d media intrusion around his mother, the late Princess Diana, during his childhood has shaped the way he handles the press.",
      "\u201cThey wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they\u2019d be everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.\u201d"

      "Japan could end up with its first female prime minister or its youngest leader in more than a century after a party leadership election on Saturday.",
      "The governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is voting for a new party leader after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced last month that he was stepping down.",
      "The winner is likely to become the new prime minister of Japan, a key U.S. ally and the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes in mid-October \u2014 though it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "Conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi, 64, and the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, are the front-runners among the five candidates. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, who is currently the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, has also surged in public opinion polls and could end up on top.",
      "The new LDP leader will be selected by 295 lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members, who will be represented by another 295 votes. The top two candidates are likely to then enter a runoff.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but right now, polls suggest that Koizumi is in the pole position,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "The LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II, is doing some \u201csoul-searching,\u201d Kingston said, after election losses spurred by a party corruption scandal as well as public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living.",
      "Those who think the party hasn\u2019t done enough to root out corruption and needs a \u201creset\u201d are looking for a \u201cfresh face\u201d and to \u201chand the baton to a younger, more charismatic leader\u201d such as Koizumi, Kingston said.",
      "Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a former environment minister but gained more prominence recently as agriculture minister when he was able to rein in runaway prices of rice, a staple Japanese food.",
      "He would be Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",
      "Others prefer Takaichi because she was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader, whose wing of the LDP has been tarnished by corruption scandals.",
      "\u201cTheir view is that the LDP has to return to its DNA to be the right-wing conservative party, and that Takaichi is the one best positioned to sort of return to the glory of Abe,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi, who has a passionate hard-line conservative base among rank-and-file party members, says one of her role models is former British leader Margaret Thatcher.",
      "\u201cShe does project strength in the way that Margaret Thatcher projected strength, and she wants to be that kind of Iron Lady of Japan,\u201d said Jeffrey Hall, a special lecturer in Japanese studies at Kanda University of International Studies.",
      "But some LDP lawmakers consider Takaichi too far right, expressing concern that her nationalistic historical views could undermine relations with China, Japan\u2019s biggest trading partner.",
      "Moderate forces could unite behind another candidate to block Takaichi from winning, much as they did in last year\u2019s leadership race when she lost to Ishiba.",
      "One person who stands to benefit from that scenario is Hayashi, who like Koizumi is Ivy League-educated. Having served in almost every major cabinet post, including foreign minister, Hayashi \u201creally stands for experience and stability,\u201d Hall said.",
      "All of the candidates have talked tough on immigration, an increasingly sensitive issue in Japan, where tourists are coming in record numbers and foreign-born residents make up a growing proportion of the population as the government grapples with labor shortages.",
      "But Takaichi has taken the strongest stances, decrying the rudeness of foreign tourists and accusing them of abusing the famous deer in Nara.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s definitely appealing to the online conservatives who have very strong anti-foreign feelings,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Koizumi, Takaichi and Hayashi all have roughly the same policy toward the U.S., \u201cwhich is keeping the status quo,\u201d he said.",
      "At the moment, the U.S. relationship \u201cis a huge headache for Japan,\u201d and there are signs that the trade deal reached with President Donald Trump in July is \u201cunraveling,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs has been especially felt by Japan\u2019s crucial auto industry, including brands popular in the U.S. such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota.",
      "Last month the U.S. tariff on cars imported from Japan was lowered to 15% from 27.5%, the same rate the U.S. imposes on almost all Japanese goods under the deal, which has yet to be put in writing. But that is still considerably higher than the previous 2.5%.",
      "The tariffs were lowered in part because Japan pledged $550 billion in U.S. investment, though there are disagreements between Washington and Tokyo as to what form that investment will take and how each country will benefit.",
      "A major challenge for Japan\u2019s next leader will be implementing the trade agreement \u201cin a way that Trump will be satisfied,\u201d Hall said.",
      "\u201cWhoever becomes prime minister will continue Japan\u2019s foreign policy of flattering Trump and being as friendly as possible to Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cand not trying to have any kind of situation where they\u2019ll have open disagreement that could cause Trump to turn on Japan in any way.\u201d"
