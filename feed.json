      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- For Googoosh, Iran's most-famous singer, life always has been balancing act of one kind or another.",
      "It began as a child, performing with her acrobat father who balanced her on a chair atop another chair resting only on his chin. Then later, as an icon of stage and screen during the last years of the shah, her looks and hairstyles were copied by Iranian women who wanted to look more \u201cGoogooshi,\" a Farsi adjective all her own.",
      "Then came the decades of silence after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, barred from performing, only to return to the stage abroad in 2000. And now, embarking on a farewell tour, she's adding author as her latest reinvention as her homeland undergoes a societal change yet again.",
      "\u201cI did not realize that all these challenges and struggles were considered a balancing act,\" the 75-year-old singer told The Associated Press. \"If that is what it means, then yes, I have spent my entire life trying to create and maintain a balance between my personal life and my artistic life.\u201d",
      "The new book by the singer, born Faegheh Atashin, is called \u201cGoogoosh: A Sinful Voice.\u201d In it, Googoosh with the help of co-author Tara Dehlavi recounts a life shaped by both the political forces that have changed Iran in the modern era and her tumultuous personal life.",
      "But it all began with performing at an early age with her father, Saber Atashin, to whom the book is dedicated along with the people of Iran. Googoosh recounts falling only once in the shows, her father catching her. But from the first performance atop the chair, Googoosh appeared bound for the spotlight.",
      "\u201cThey held their breath and waited in complete silence,\u201d she recounted. \u201cEvery muscle in my body tensed. Seconds felt like an eternity. Finally, Papa slowly began to lower me gently toward the ground. When my feet touched the floor, the audience sighed in relief before they erupted into roaring applause. I had survived. And we were a hit!\u201d",
      "Googoosh began singing and performing in films at a young age. That included before the royal court of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who later became mortally ill and fled Iran just before the 1979 revolution.",
      "Googoosh had been tabloid fodder in Iran before the revolution. Married four times in her life, her personal life long had been a fascination. And within her book, she recounts undergoing abortions and battling with substance abuse around and after the revolution, including freebasing cocaine and smoking opium. She considers suicide at one point in New York City before deciding to go back to Iran under its newly formed theocracy.",
      "\u201cThere were times where I would ask this question to you and say, \u2018Are you sure you want to share this?\u2019\" Dehlavi, her co-author said. \"And you always said that, \u2018I\u2019m either I\u2019m telling my story or I\u2019m not. I have to I have to tell it all.\u2019\u201d",
      "Returning to Iran, Googoosh found herself harassed by its newly empowered theocracy, which put a lien on her home and blocked her ability to be issued a passport. Authorities banned her from performing or singing, she recounted, and at one point imprisoned her",
      "But she describes while trying to hide her identity in public or in private, people always pushed her to sing again, to find her voice despite the restrictions and threats.",

I did not want that life. I hoped I could somehow continue performing for my own people, inside my own country.\u201d",
      "Ultimately though, in 2000 under the government of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, Googoosh was able to get a contract to perform abroad, pull the money together to pay off her liens, obtain a passport and leave Iran. She never returned, but has performed abroad for the last 25 years for Iranians who similarly are homesick for their country.",
      "Islamic hard-liners within Iran still denounce her, particularly after 2014 music video about homosexual love, punishable by death in the country.",
      "Googoosh's new book and her farewell tour come at a time of change in Iran. More and more, Iranian women choose to forgo the country\u2019s mandatory headscarf, or hijab. The 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the nationwide protests that followed enraged women of all ages and views in a way few other issues have since the revolution.",
      "But meanwhile, Iran's economy continues to strain under international sanctions over its nuclear program. Its theocracy continues to execute people in the wake of the 12-day war with Israel, while also increasingly targeting intellectuals and others with arrest.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing our youth, especially women, fighting for their most basic rights, including choosing what to wear, expressing their art freely if they have artistic talent, and living a normal life like people in other parts of the world,\u201d Googoosh said.",
      "\"People in my country are struggling to give their families an ordinary life. They struggle for clean water, clean air, and land where they can live. Our young people grew old without ever enjoying their youth. Our people must end this painful cycle and gain the freedoms every human being deserves.\u201d",
      "But asked what her plans were once her tour ended, Googoosh left open the possibility of once again getting back on the stage.",
      "\u201cThroughout my life I have almost never been able to plan my future. Everything has simply happened to me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have not controlled our own lives for 47 years. Whatever we planned never happened, and whatever happened was never planned by us. I am no exception, and I expect to continue living this way.\u201d",

      "Mexican composer Mar\u00eda Leonora relies on fire, ritual and Mesoamerican tradition to shape her immersive concerts",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican composer Mar\u00eda Leonora prepares for each concert as if she\u2019s gearing up for battle.",
      "Her makeup has a tribal edge. Her clothes are arranged in layers she sheds as the show unfolds. An amulet over her belly button serves as protection.",
      "\u201cI look into the mirror and I sort of go to war,\u201d she said prior to a recent presentation in Mexico City. \u201cI brace myself to walk through the fire and whatever happens happens.\u201d",
      "Her 2025 performances were conceived as chapters connected by a common thread. She called the series \u201cThrough All the Fire,\u201d believing that both music and flames carry a powerful renewal quality.",
      "\u201cA fire can burn and destroy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you make it through, you can be reborn.\u201d",
      "That same idea of heat and renewal is present in the ambience of her shows. Her concerts draw inspiration from a pre-Hispanic steam bath known as a \u201ctemazcal,\u201d which played a significant role in Mesoamerican social and religious life.",
      "\u201cYou may suffer as you enter a temazcal, but you put up with it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou sweat and your ego cracks. Even if you don\u2019t want to, heat breaks you.\u201d",
      "Temazcales had a ritual function and a cosmological significance for Mesoamerican cultures, wrote archaeologist Agust\u00edn Ortiz in a publication from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology and History.",
      "Built in stone or adobe structures, each bath could hold dozens of people and produced steam by heating stones before dousing them with water.",
      "\u201cThe temazcal was seen as the Earth\u2019s interior and as a passageway between the world of the living and the underworld,\u201d Ortiz wrote. \u201cIt was conceived as an entrance to the \u2018beyond.\u2019\u201d",
      "Most of them were located near ceremonial ballcourts, underscoring their connection to the game\u2019s ritual dimension.",
      "Temazcales remain in use today, but their earliest forms have been found in Maya cities such as Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Palenque, and in sites like Tlatelolco and Teotihuac\u00e1n in central Mexico.",
      "Mar\u00eda Leonora encountered music\u2019s healing power at age 16.",
      "She embraced punk rock as an adolescent going through a rough patch. And after learning how to play the drums, she first set foot on a stage.",
      "\u201cI was able to transform so many things just by playing and standing in front of an audience,\u201d she said. \u201cI can honestly say it saved my life.\u201d",
      "From then on, she spent years playing with other musicians and engaging in different genres.",

      "She describes her shows as \u201cimmersive concerts,\u201d meaning that sound, lights and visuals play a role in shaping the attendees\u2019 involvement.",
      "\u201cWe want the audience to feel enveloped in the experience of each song,\u201d said producer Diego Cristian Salda\u00f1a. \u201cIn the emotions and specific sensations the music triggers and that we\u2019re intentionally seeking.\u201d",
      "That intention comes through in how audiences describe the experience.",
      "In a video released by Mexico City\u2019s Ministry of Culture in late November, a young man who had seen Mar\u00eda Leonora\u2019s performances on three occasions said each experience had felt deeply gratifying. Another woman mentioned she felt exhausted ahead of the show but left full of energy, wishing to get on with her life.",
      "\u201cWe constantly encourage people to actively participate,\u201d she said. \u201cTo dive into an internal journey.\u201d",
      "\u201cThrough All the Fire\u201d starts with her voice inviting the audience into crossing the \u201csalt circle,\u201d which means to leave behind the outside world.",
      "As the lights remain warm and subtle, her first song talks about love. Then the repertoire moves to a breakup. The pain brought by separation reflects on the stage.",
      "As the show evolves, Mar\u00eda Leonora explores deeper emotions, and she gradually removes her makeup and takes off layers of clothes. Then the climax comes.",
      "\u201cAs my character is exhausted, to the ground, it starts to breathe again,\u201d she said. \u201cThe moment comes to walk through the fire, as you would do in a temazcal.\u201d",
      "To liberate themselves with her, attendees are encouraged to howl, scream or engage in whatever ritual they feel they need. Once free from what weighs on them, they sing.",
      "\u201cOur last song is like a first ray of light,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can look back into your life and move forward toward luminosity.\u201d",

      "Designer Matthieu Blazy has taken Chanel's fashions underground, with a runway show on a New York City subway platform",
      "NEW YORK -- Chanel\u2019s new showman, Matthieu Blazy, took his designs on the road Tuesday \u2014 or rather, underground, with a buzzy New York runway show staged on an actual subway platform.",
      "The designer, just weeks after his splashy Paris debut for Chanel in October, took over a decommissioned part of Manhattan's Bowery station for his first M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection. The annual show, which takes place in a different city each year, celebrates the craftsmanship of the artisans that partner with Chanel.",
      "In this case, it was two shows \u2014 one in the afternoon and one in the evening. And befitting the first Chanel shows in New York since 2018, there were VIPs aplenty: A$AP Rocky, Tilda Swinton, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Kristen Stewart, Sofia Coppola, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Jessie Buckley, Margaret Qualley, Bowen Yang, Jon Bon Jovi and many others.",
      "The location had been a closely held secret. Guests entered via a doorway at 168 Bowery, and at first, it seemed like Chanel had perhaps decorated an event space to resemble a subway station, complete with tiled walls, turnstiles and a newsstand (with its own bespoke newspapers).",
      "But down a flight of stairs was the real platform. Guests settled into bleacher seats resembling subway benches. \u201cStand clear of the closing doors!\u201d came the announcement on the soundtrack, familiar to New Yorkers. Then a train came rolling in, and out of the cars came the models.",
      "The show was a marked contrast in vibe with the last M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection in New York in 2018, when the late designer Karl Lagerfeld took over the Egyptian Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for what felt like a mini-Met Gala, with clothes channeling the luxury of Egyptian royalty.",
      "Blazy was inspired not by royalty but by ordinary urban commuters, of different ages and types, coming together in a mashup of styles from different eras, from the 1920s onward.",
      "\u201cThe New York subway belongs to all,\u201d the designer said in his show notes. \"Everyone uses it. There are students and game-changers, statesmen and teenagers. It is a place full of wonderful encounters, a clash of pop archetypes.\u201d",
      "His models strolled the platform, some checking for arriving trains \u2014 feigning annoyance at their lateness \u2014 or leaning against a post as they waited. Their numbers increased until, by the end, there was a virtual rush hour of fashion, with the eclectic soundtrack playing the \u201cHappy Days\u201d theme song as a finale.",

      "\u201cThis felt like breaking the system,\u201d said Stewart, speaking after the afternoon show. \u201cI genuinely had an emotional response to the show. I felt like I just saw so many different versions of a person walking. It wasn't one woman.\"",
      "Stewart, like others, had no idea going in what the show\u2019s theme would be, and thought the subway environment felt like \u201ca flurry of fleeting caught moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 I wanted to go with them,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI believed in it. All of this is artifice, but when you do a really good impression of the truth, you find your own. This felt real to me.\u201d",
      "It was real enough that Chanel had printed its own \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 called La Gazette \u2014 to accompany the show, with articles and interviews. An interview with Blazy quoted the designer as saying the collection was inspired partly by the 1931 visit to New York of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",
      "And he sang the praises of the subway.",

      "If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood\u2019s year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear",
      "NEW YORK -- If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood's year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear: Paul Thomas Anderson's \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is the Oscar front-runner.",
      "On Monday, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d won best film at the 35th Gotham Awards. On Tuesday, it was named best film by the New York Film Critics Circle. On Wednesday, it swept the National Board of Review Awards, winning best film, best director for Anderson and acting awards for Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and newcomer Chase Infiniti.",
      "Expect to hear this pun a lot: one award after another.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d Anderson said at the Gothams. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",
      "That may be the first, and last, time Anderson can say that this awards season.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a father-daughter tale of political resistance in the face of recurring oppression, has firmly established itself as the movie of the moment. With an opening scene depicting a raid at an immigrant detention facility, Anderson's opus has struck critics and moviegoers, alike, for its contemporary relevance in the first year of President Donald Trump's second term. Even foes of the film, like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, have predicted it will \u201cwin all the Academy Awards.\u201d",
      "Yet Anderson's film is, in many ways, an Academy Awards oddity. It's a critically acclaimed release that skipped film festivals. It's a big-budget studio movie that wasn't a hit. In fact, should \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d go on to win at the March 15 Oscars, it could be one of the only money-losers to ever win the industry's top honor.",
      "Smaller films have, increasingly, won best picture. That includes indies like \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d \u2014 much-praised films with minuscule box office. Hollywood long ago got used to honoring films that exist largely outside its mainstream, franchise-obsessed business. And the notion of what constitutes a best-picture movie has grown elastic. \u201cParasite,\u201d\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and, the most recent winner, \u201cAnora,\u201d have all shaken traditional notions of Oscar material.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d represents something different. With a production budget of at least $130 million (some reports have it much higher) and another $70 million in marketing costs, it will have to have an extraordinary after-theater life to break even. Thus far, the Warner Bros. release has made $70.6 million domestically and $131.6 million overseas \u2014 great sums for an adult-oriented, R-rated, auteur-driven film that runs nearly three hours.",
      "Still, Variety earlier estimated \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will lose $100 million, a figure that Warner Bros. has disputed. It's too harsh a label, but such a discrepancy could make \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d tagged as the first best picture-winning flop.",
      "Awards season has a long way to go. None of the awards dished out this week has any direct correlation with academy voters. Some contenders, like A24's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d have yet to hit theaters. Others, like Focus Features' \u201cHamnet,\u201d are just arriving. Support is also strong for another Warner Bros. title, Ryan Coogler's \u201cSinners,\u201d which might pose the stiffest competition for \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d Both films are returning to IMAX screens on Dec. 12.",
      "But a bottom line in the red is far from a unique cross to bear this fall. Aside from the blockbuster launches of \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d waves of would-be awards contenders \u2014 films like \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d \u201cRoofman\u201d and \u201cChristy\u201d\u2014 have fizzled with ticket buyers. It's been a grueling fall for a wide spectrum of contenders, a context that makes \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d comparatively, a smash success.",
      "The biggest financial ding against it, really, is that it cost a lot \u2014 arguably too much \u2014 to make. At a time when so few films anything like \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d get greenlit, let alone with such budgets, the cost of \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d could even be seen as a badge of honor. Here is a movie that win, lose or draw, is in the fight for a kind of moviemaking that's under siege. To quote DiCaprio's Bob Ferguson: \u201cViva la revolution!\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- RoboCop has finally found a permanent home in Detroit.",
      "A statue looming 11 feet tall (3.3 meters) and weighing 3,500 pounds (1,587 kilograms) has been drawing fans since it began standing guard over the Motor City on Wednesday afternoon, after about 15 years in the making. Even in a snowstorm in the dark, people were driving by to see it, said Jim Toscano, co-owner of the FREE AGE film production company where the bronze-cast statue now stands bolted near the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cRoboCop\u201d hit theaters in 1987, portraying a near-future Detroit as crime-ridden and poorly protected by a beleaguered and outgunned police force, until actor Peter Weller appeared as a nearly invincible cyborg, created by a nefarious corporation bent on privatizing policing.",
      "There was a time when Detroit pushed back on anything pointing to its past reputation as an unsafe city, and the movie, which developed a cult following, spawning two sequels and a reboot, didn't help its image.",
      "But things have changed. Violent crime has been trending down for years. Homicide numbers have dropped below mid-1960s levels. And city officials offered no objections to the statue's installation, Toscano said.",
      "\u201cI think there will be a lot more acceptance,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cDetroit has come a long way. You put in a little nostalgia and that helps.\u201d",
      "The statue campaign appears to have started around 2010 when Detroit Mayor Dave Bing was tagged in a tweet that noted Philadelphia's statue of boxer Rocky Balboa and said RoboCop would be a \u201cGREAT ambassador for Detroit.\u201d",
      "Bing tweeted back, saying there were no such plans. But some Detroiters ran with the idea, crowdfunding it through a 2012 Kickstarter campaig n that raised more than $67,000 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide, and Detroit sculptor Giorgio Gikas finished the statue in 2017.",
      "Then, it got stuck, stored away from public view.",
      "The Michigan Science Center in Detroit ultimately nixed plans to host the sculpture in 2021, citing pressures from the coronavirus pandemic and the need to focus museum resources. Officials in Stevens Point, Wisconsin raised their hands, hoping to honor Weller, a native son of that city, by erecting it outside the police station or in a park.",
      "The search for a suitable home for RoboCop remained in limbo until about three years ago when Toscano's company bought a building in Eastern Market, an open-air produce market, shopping and entertainment district just northeast of downtown. Toscano says he thought they were \u201ckidding\u201d when he was contacted by the creator of the statue idea and Eastern Market officials. But he and his business partner gladly came on board: \u201cIt's too unusual, too unique, too cool not to do,\u201d Toscano said.",

      "DALLAS -- From the election of Zohran Mamdani to the intrigue surrounding the jewel heist at the Louvre, keeping up with this year's news also left some Americans struggling with pronunciations. That's put both the name of New York City's incoming mayor and the famed Paris museum on a list of the most mispronounced words in 2025.",
      "The language-learning company Babbel and closed-captioning company The Captioning Group on Thursday released a list of the words that news anchors, politicians and other public figures in the U.S. struggled with the most this year, giving an overview of the people and topics that had Americans talking.",
      "As Mamdani made his political rise, the democratic socialist's name often was mangled. When he takes office in January, the 34-year-old will become the city\u2019s first Muslim mayor, first born in Africa and first of South Asian heritage. Babbel said his name \u2014 which should be pronounced zoh-RAHN mam-DAH-nee \u2014 was most commonly mispronounced when people swapped the \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d in his last name.",
      "Mamdani has said he doesn't mind if someone tries to pronounce his name correctly and misses but that some mispronounce it intentionally. During one mayoral race debate, he chided former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's pronunciation of his name, telling his opponent: \"The name is Mamdani. M-A-M-D-A-N-I.\u201d",
      "The theft of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre in October had many people mispronouncing the name of the world\u2019s most-visited museum. Babbel says the correct pronunciation is LOOV-ruh, with a very soft pronunciation on the \u201cruh,\u201d which can be a challenge for English speakers.",
      "\u201cA lot of these words come from different languages and so we have to adapt to a sound that we\u2019ve never made before,\u201d said Esteban Touma, a linguistic and cultural expert at Babbel.",

Babbel says the correct pronunciation is ay-OH-win, said with a three-beat pattern.",

      "The Kennedy Center, known for theater and opera, becomes the sports world's focus on Friday",
      "WASHINGTON -- On Friday afternoon, the Kennedy Center, best known for its theater, opera and ballet, will be the unlikely center of the sports world when the matchups for next year's World Cup are announced there. By Sunday, in a quick pivot, the venue will assume its more traditional role as the host of the annual awards program honoring some of the top artists in the U.S.",
      "The culture headsnap has one thing in common: President Donald Trump's starring role.",
      "Trump was instrumental in working with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to move the draw to the Kennedy Center after it was widely expected to take place in Las Vegas. FIFA may further recognize Trump at the event with a newly created peace prize. Infantino hasn't confirmed that Trump will be the recipient but the two have forged a notably close relationship and Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize. On the same day last month that FIFA said it would issue the new award, Infantino called Trump a \u201cclose friend\" who has \u201csuch an incredible energy.\u201d",
      "If the prospect of a peace prize isn't enough attention, Trump will assume a role played in the past by the broadcasting legend Walter Cronkite and other luminaires by hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, if current plans hold. When Trump announced the honorees at the Kennedy Center in August, he cast himself as reluctantly taking on the duties at the request of his chief of staff.",
      "\u201cI've been asked to host,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, I\u2019m the President of the United States. Are you fools asking me to do that? Sir, you\u2019ll get much higher ratings. I said 'I don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "There are few recent parallels to the fervor that's about to descend on the Kennedy Center. When the U.S. last hosted the World Cup in 1994, the draw was held in Las Vegas and Bill Clinton, the president at the time, didn't attend. When presidents participate in the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 Trump skipped the event during his first term \u2014 they generally stay in their box, wave to the audience and cheer the honorees.",
      "This week's lineup is a reminder that for Trump \u2014 a two-term president, bestselling author and onetime reality television star \u2014 his favorite role is that of a showman. And Trump's transformation of the Kennedy Center from one of Washington's relatively apolitical spaces into something of an extension of his White House affords him a natural stage.",
      "The shift at the Kennedy Center began quickly after Trump's return to Washington in late January. Within a month, he ousted the institution\u2019s leadership, filled the board of trustees with his supporters and announced he had been elected the board\u2019s chair.",
      "Trump and his aides criticized the Kennedy Center's programming as \u201cwoke\" and accused the previous leadership of financial mismanagement and neglecting the building. Some renovations have been underway in recent weeks, including using white paint over columns that were previously gold.",
      "Deborah Rutter, who was fired as the Kennedy Center's president, said in a May statement that allegations of poor financial management were \u201cfalse\u201d and insisted that when she left, \u201cthe Kennedy Center was fiscally sound.\u201d",
      "But the fallout has been intense with prominent musicals such as \u201cHamilton\u201d canceling performances. Actor Issa Rae and author Louise Penny also withdrew from appearances while consultants such as musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming resigned. Some artists have expressed a sense of sadness at the changes.",
      "\u201cIt was always a joy to be asked to perform at the Kennedy Center,\u201d Jane Alexander, an actor and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, told The Associated Press.",
      "For its part, the Kennedy Center's new leadership has said it is focusing on programming that appeals to a broad audience and doesn't lose money. Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell has emphasized \u201ccommon sense\u201d programming.",
      "But Democrats in Congress are scrutinizing whether the new management is ultimately costing the Kennedy Center money. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released documents last month showing the Kennedy Center entered into an agreement giving FIFA \u201cexclusive\u201d use of the facility from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 at no cost, arguing that the venue was at risk of losing millions in potential revenue because of the arrangement.",

In a response to Whitehouse, Grenell said he has raised $117 million this year.",
      "The notion that the Kennedy Center would end up in a spat with Congress would have been unheard of just a few years ago. The venue's history is rooted in bipartisan cooperation when Republican President Dwight Eisenhower worked with Democrats who controlled Congress at the time to pass legislation that would create a national cultural center.",

      "The Kennedy Center's big weekend caps what has been a difficult year for Washington as Trump has portrayed the city as crime-ridden even as the violent crime rate is down.

      "Claire\u2019s grown kids (Felicity Jones, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Dominic Sessa ) don\u2019t appreciate her efforts. Her husband (Denis Leary) is supportive without being helpful. And she is operating as a one woman show, managing this precious time with her family and trying to keep it all cozy and happy and fun through constant, thankless labor (cooking, cleaning, wrapping, planning). She even looks fabulous on her many, many (too many?) garbage runs. But after one particularly cruel oversight from her family, she takes off from her suburban prison and doesn\u2019t tell anyone. For once, she\u2019s decided to go do something for herself.",
      "Promising though it may seem, \u201cOh. What. Fun\u201d is a movie that does very little with its setup and terrific cast (including the likes of Danielle Brooks, Joan Chen, Maude Apatow, Rose Abdoo and Eva Longoria in almost cameo-sized roles) opting instead for the most generic version of itself.",
      "The movie, streaming Wednesday on Prime Video, begins with a kind of \u201clow point\u201d (for a beautiful, well-off, stay-at-home Texas mom, that is) in which she tells some children in a neighboring car at a gas station to be nicer to their exhausted mother in the front seat. \u201cShe\u2019ll be dead someday,\u201d she says calmly and seriously. She wishes the mother a Merry Christmas, gives the kids a piercing look and then we get the dreaded freeze-frame/record scratch and a voiceover about being entitled to a little outburst around the holidays and a half-hearted rant about how many holiday movies are about men. Already this movie is making this poor woman apologize.",
      "\u201cThey need to make a movie about the true heroes of the holidays: Moms,\u201d Claire says. Sure, yes, preach Claire, even if her exclusions are suspect and her examples need further review. I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cHome Alone\u201d was at least a little bit about the mom, and that \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles\u201d doesn\u2019t deserve the vitriol. Alas, noble intentions aside, \u201cOh. What. Fun.\u201d probably wasn\u2019t what she had in mind.",
      "Director Michael Showalter co-wrote the script with the short story\u2019s author, Chandler Baker and is committed to keeping the proceedings light and breezy (no cancer diagnoses here). But the effect is a movie that seems almost embarrassed to commit to its own silly premise, rushing through everything instead of letting us enjoy this cast. Everyone gets assigned one tidy problem or flaw and no one has any sort of lived-in familial chemistry with one another.",
      "Channing (Jones) is the oldest and is married to Doug (Jason Schwartzman) who really wants her younger sister Taylor (Moretz) to think he\u2019s cool although Taylor, a serial monogamist who always brings a new woman home for the holidays, is just mean to him. Sessa is the youngest: Underemployed and recently dumped. There are two grandchildren too, Channing and Doug\u2019s twins, but they\u2019re nonentities.",

      "A federal vaccine advisory committee this week is expected to discuss whether newborns should still get the hepatitis B vaccine \u2014 the first shot found to prevent cancer",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal vaccine advisory committee this week is expected to discuss whether newborns should still get the hepatitis B vaccine \u2014 the first shot found to prevent cancer.",
      "Federal health recommendations now suggest that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection in their first day of life, but U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s committee on Thursday is expected to change that \u2014 contradicting previous public health advice.",
      "It's not clear exactly what the committee is considering, but the American Academy of Pediatrics will still urge a birth dose, said the organization's Dr. Sean O'Leary.",
      "\u201cWe are going to continue to recommend it because it saves lives,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's a look at the disease, the vaccine and the debate over changing the recommendations.",
      "Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that for most people lasts less than six months. But for some \u2014 especially infants and children \u2014 it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.",
      "In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use.",
      "But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby. As many as 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B go on to have chronic infections, meaning their immune systems don't completely clear the virus.",
      "As many as 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, and as many as half are unaware they are infected, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a federal scientist, identified the virus behind the infection in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for the discovery, which led to tests and vaccines. The first hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1981.",
      "For decades, the nation's vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.",
      "In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months.",
      "Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren't tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.",
      "A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its analysis of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired all 17 members of ACIP earlier this year and replaced them with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.",

      "Peppered with questions about why a change was necessary, committee member Dr. Robert Malone said: \u201cThe signal that is prompting this is not one of safety. It\u2019s one of trust. ... It\u2019s one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent.\"",
      "The committee tabled a vote at the September meeting, but it's slated to be acted on during Thursday's meeting, according to the agenda. Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.",
      "Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.",
      "This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released a report estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report \u2014 which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal \u2014 estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.",
      "But an ACIP change to the recommendation may have limited impact, O'Leary said.",
      "The committee's most direct power comes over what's covered by the government Vaccines for Children program, which pays for shots for uninsured children from low-income families. Hepatitis B shots often have been bundled into the final hospital bill for childbirth. So a new ACIP recommendation likely would not be an economic obstacle for the current practice continuing at many hospitals, he said.",
      "But any change stands to confuse and frighten parents, he added.",
      "\u201cIf it scares, it shares\u201d on social media, O'Leary said.",
      "Several medical and public health organizations \u2014 and even some state government officials \u2014 have said, in advance of the meeting, that changing the recommendation is a terrible idea. Among them is a recently formed coalition of government leaders from several Northeastern states, which this week issued a statement saying they would continue to urge families to get a birth dose within 24 hours of delivery.",
      "U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, this week called on Congress to compel Kennedy to appear at a hearing and explain ACIP's actions.",

The agreement focuses on preventing and treating diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis with an emphasis on faith-based medical providers, although all clinics and hospitals enrolled in Kenya\u2019s health insurance system will be eligible to receive funding, according to U.S. officials.",

      "A new study suggests a single HPV vaccination appears just as effective as two doses at preventing the viral infection that causes cervical cancer",
      "WASHINGTON -- A single HPV vaccination appears just as effective as two doses at preventing the viral infection that causes cervical cancer, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and spread through sex. Most HPV infections clear up on their own but some linger, causing cancers that appear years later, including cervical cancer in women and rarer cancers in both women and men.",
      "HPV vaccination has been recommended for U.S. girls since 2006 and already the nation is counting fewer cases of precancerous cervical lesions among women in their 20s \u2014- the first age group to start getting the shots back when they were tweens or teens.",
      "But cervical cancer kills about 340,000 women worldwide annually \u2014 and the new findings from a huge study in Costa Rica could help spur global efforts to protect more girls and young women in harder-to-reach low-income countries.",
      "Led by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the study enrolled more than 20,000 girls between ages 12 and 16. Researchers tested two different HPV vaccines used around the world, giving half the girls one shot type and the rest the other. Then six months later, half of the girls got a second dose of their assigned vaccine \u2014 while the rest instead received an unrelated child vaccination.",
      "They all were tracked for five years, receiving regular cervical tests for the most cancer-prone HPV strains. Infection rates were compared to a separate unvaccinated group.",
      "A single HPV shot provided about 97% protection, similar to two doses, concluded researchers from the NCI and Costa Rica\u2019s Agency for Biomedical Research. The findings were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Previous studies had suggested one dose could work well but the new findings confirm strong protection for at least five years, Dr. Ruanne Barnabas, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, wrote in an accompanying editorial.",

      "The U.S. recommends two HPV shots starting at age 11 or 12 for most girls and boys \u2014 as the virus also can cause head-and-neck and other cancers. Catch-up shots are recommended for anyone through age 26 who hasn't been vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported about 78% of 13- to 17-year-olds have gotten at least one dose.",
      "But globally, the World Health Organization estimates less than a third of adolescent girls have been vaccinated \u2014 and the agency already had begun recommending either one or two doses in an effort to broaden protection.",
      "The new study offered no information about HPV-related cancers beyond the cervix, and the researchers cautioned that longer monitoring is needed.",

      "The West Virginia Supreme Court has paused a ruling that allowed parents to use religious beliefs to opt out of required school vaccines for their children",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The West Virginia Board of Education on Tuesday reinstated a school vaccination mandate after the state Supreme Court paused a lower court's ruling that allowed parents to cite religious beliefs to opt out of shots required for their children to attend classes.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier Tuesday issued a stay in last week's ruling by Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble in a class-action lawsuit. In issuing an injunction, Froble said children of families who objected to the state\u2019s compulsory vaccination law on religious grounds would be allowed to attend school and participate in extracurricular sports.",
      "The Supreme Court halted Froble's ruling pending resolution of appeals in the case. In light of that, the board said in a statement that it \u201cis reinstating its directive to county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws. This directive will be in effect until the Supreme Court issues further guidance.\u201d",
      "The board further said its priority is to ensure compliance with the vaccine law \u201cand safeguard the health and well-being of all students across West Virginia.\u201d",
      "The board had suspended the vaccine mandate last week after Froble's ruling, which said that a state policy barring parents from seeking religious exemptions violated the Equal Protection for Religion Act signed into law in 2023 by then-Republican Gov. Jim Justice.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. In June, the board directed public schools to ignore Morrisey's executive order. Two groups had sued over the executive order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Legislation that would have allowed the religious exemptions was passed by the state Senate and rejected by the House of Delegates earlier this year. Froble said in his ruling that the failure of the legislation did not determine the application of the 2023 law. He rejected the defendants' argument that religious exemptions can only be created by legislative action.",

      "Miranda Guzman and other parents sued the state and local boards of education and the Raleigh County schools superintendent. Guzman had obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the local school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Last month, Froble certified the lawsuit as a class action involving 570 families who had sought and received religious exemptions in other parts of the state. He said the class action also applies to parents who seek religious exemptions in the future.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "NEW YORK -- A high-stakes hearing in the New York murder case against Luigi Mangione continues Thursday, a year to the day after prosecutors say he gunned down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law enforcement officers and items \u2014 including a gun and a notebook \u2014 allegedly seized from his backpack.",
      "The evidence is key to prosecutors' case. They have said that the 9 mm handgun matches the firearm used in the killing, that writings in the notebook laid out Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference, and that he gave Pennsylvania police the same fake name that the alleged gunman used at a New York hostel days before the shooting.",
      "Thompson, 50, was shot from behind as he walked to an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. He became UnitedHealthcare's CEO in 2021 and had worked within parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. for 20 years.",
      "The hearing, which started Monday and could extend to next week, applies only to the state case. But it is giving the public an extensive preview of some testimony, video, 911 audio and other records relevant to both cases.",
      "It's not immediately clear what witnesses or evidence are expected Thursday.",
      "Tuesday's court session displayed police body-camera video of officers confronting Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and concluding \u2014 to their amazement \u2014 that he was the much-publicized suspect in Thompson's killing five days earlier.",
      "They interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he\u2019d been in New York recently and other questions, including: \u201cWhy are you nervous?\u201d",

Still, they patted Mangione down and pushed his backpack away from him. About 15 minutes in, they warned him that he was being investigated and would be arrested if he repeated what they'd determined was a fake name.",

      "The video also provided glimpses of officers searching his backpack, a matter that will likely be explored further as the hearing goes on.",
      "Mangione's lawyers argue that his statements shouldn't be allowed as trial evidence because officers started questioning him before reading his rights. The defense contends the backpack items should be excluded because police didn\u2019t get a warrant before searching his bag.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet detailed their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Federal prosecutors have maintained that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there was nothing dangerous inside and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest.",
      "Many criminal cases see disputes over evidence and the complicated legal standards governing police searches and interactions with potential suspects.",

      "Later this week, the committee is scheduled to discuss the pediatric vaccine schedule and hepatitis B shots given to newborns.",
      "HHS officials issued a press release praising Kulldorff and his work while leading the panel but did not answer additional questions about the changes. Kulldorff did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "The committee makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee's recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.",
      "Under Kulldorff's leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.",
      "At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called thimerosal be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",
      "In September, the group recommended new restrictions on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the unprecedented step of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations \u2014 not even for high-risk populations like seniors \u2014 instead making it a matter of personal choice.",
      "Several doctors\u2019 groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to follow guidance that was previously in place.",
      "Kulldorff's departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members.",
      "It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.",
      "Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its traditional \"evidence-to-recommendation\" framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote.",

      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",

      "A new type of lens approved by the FDA promises to slow nearsightedness in children",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "The suggested retail price is $450, according to EssilorLuxottica, the company that makes the lenses.",
      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",
      "But Gupta says many parents and physicians are likely to prefer the glasses.",
      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",
      "Under the FDA\u2019s approval decision, the lenses can be prescribed to any child with myopia who\u2019s within the recommended age range. There were no serious side effects, according to FDA, although some children reported visual disturbances, such as halos around objects while wearing the lenses.",
      "The studies that the FDA reviewed for approval were conducted in Asia. Repka said U.S. ophthalmologists and optometrists may want to see some additional research.",
      "\u201cI think before it becomes widely used, we will need some data in the United States\" showing that the lenses work, said Repka, who is conducting a U.S.-based study of the new lenses supported by the National Institutes of Health.",

      "A new wave of peptides, often banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, is easily available online, raising concerns about potential Olympic doping scandals",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- The next Olympic doping scandal could be delivered right to your doorstep.",
      "A trove of so-called research chemicals known as peptides, many of them banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency and some not approved for human use in the United States, are available with the simple click of a button through online retailers. One seller is Amazon. Another is Alibaba, a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "The easy availability of the drugs combined with their hard-to-detect nature is precisely the toxic combination doping regulators and Olympic officials are trying to avoid. With the Milan Cortina Games just two months away, they are hoping to break a string of scandals involving the Russians and Chinese that have disrupted the Games, both summer and winter, since 2014.",
      "Though online pharmaceuticals and supplements have for years been portrayed as a risk by anti-doping authorities, the influx of certain hard-to-detect peptides \u2014 chains of protein-building amino acids marketeed to help with anything from anti-aging to workout recovery to weight and memory loss \u2014 presents a more difficult challenge.",
      "\u201cThese substances have proliferated,\u201d said Oliver Catlin, president of the Anti-Doping Sciences Institute, whose late father, Don, was among the godfathers of antidoping research.",
      "Most of these peptides are so-called \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are also banned by the WADA code, either under its \u201cS2\u201d category that encompasses peptides or under its \u201cSO\u201d classification, a catch-all category for \"non-approved substances.\"",
      "The few substances specifically listed under the \u201cS0\" category \u2014 such as the popular BPC 157 \u2014 are placed there because the pharmalogical make-up of the substances don't fit neatly into another category on the banned list.",
      "One tricky part of the \u201cS0\u201d category is that it includes unapproved substances that aren't specifically listed because, for instance, there is no way to test for that drug and regulators don't want to reveal that to users.",
      "Catlin's research found hundreds of the banned or illegal peptides available on the online market and an ever-shifting menu of items, with some of them removed after The Associated Press started asking questions.",
      "\u201cIt's not like it happened overnight,\" he said. \"The mainstream use of peptides has exploded in the last five years.\u201d",
      "Dan Burke, a former FDA official who now heads intelligence and investigations at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said the new-age peptides are hard to corral online because the American law prohibiting their sale dates to 1938 \u201cand it just isn\u2019t working and doesn\u2019t work to this day.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bad guys know it, and that\u2019s why the stuff proliferates,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Though some peptides \u2014 insulin and the newly popular weight-loss dynamo GLP-1 are among the best examples \u2014 are time-tested, perfectly legal (with a prescription) and effective, other substances in the category are not legally marketable, either as supplements or prescription or over-the-counter drugs.",
      "A number of them, including BPC-157, could be found on multiple online sites, including Amazon and Alibaba. The latter is a major IOC sponsor \u201ccommitted to helping the IOC transform the Olympic Games for the digital era.\u201d",
      "Asked by AP about this connection, an IOC spokesperson said Alibaba \u201cconfirmed to us that it consistently monitors its marketplaces and that it does not have prohibited substances for sale from the WADA 2025 list.\u201d Approached by AP, a representative for Alibaba.com asked for links to \u201cproblematic\u201d drugs sold by its marketplace and, after the AP sent two of them, said they had removed those items.",

      "DUMAYR, Syria -- A raid by U.S. forces and a local Syrian group aiming to capture an Islamic State group official instead killed a man who had been working undercover gathering intelligence on the extremists, family members and Syrian officials have told The Associated Press.",
      "The killing in October underscores the complex political and security landscape as the United States begins working with interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa in the fight against remnants of IS.",
      "According to relatives, Khaled al-Masoud had been spying on IS for years on behalf of the insurgents led by al-Sharaa and then for al-Sharaa\u2019s interim government, established after the fall of former President Bashar Assad a year ago. Al-Sharaa\u2019s insurgents were mainly Islamists, some connected to al-Qaida, but enemies of IS who often clashed with it over the past decade.",
      "Neither U.S. nor Syrian government officials have commented on al-Masoud\u2019s death, an indication that neither side wants the incident to derail improving ties. Weeks after the Oct. 19 raid, al-Sharaa visited Washington and announced Syria would join the global coalition against IS.",

      "Al-Masoud had been infiltrating IS in the southern deserts of Syria known as the Badiya, one of the places where remnants of the extremist group have remained active, Nasr said.",
      "The raid targeting him was a result of \u201cthe lack of coordination between the coalition and Damascus,\u201d Nasr said.",
      "In the latest sign of the increasing cooperation, the U.S. Central Command said Sunday that American troops and forces from Syria\u2019s Interior Ministry had located and destroyed 15 IS weapons caches in the south.",

      "The deadliest fire in Hong Kong in decades is putting pressure on Beijing\u2019s governance system in the city",
      "HONG KONG -- The deadliest fire in Hong Kong in decades is piling pressure on Beijing\u2019s \u201cpatriots-only\u201d governance system, casting a shadow on elections widely seen as a further step to tighten control over the city's legislature.",
      "Sunday's vote to elect new lawmakers to Hong Kong's 90-member Legislative Council comes just 11 days after a massive fire engulfed seven towers in a high-rise apartment complex, killing at least 159 people in the financial hub's worst blaze since 1948.",
      "With many voters in the city grown politically apathetic since China\u2019s crackdown shut out the pro-democracy camp in recent years, Sunday's turnout rate will be a key barometer of public sentiment toward the government and its handling of the fire.",
      "While there hasn\u2019t yet been significant public protests because of the chilling effect of a wide-ranging security crackdown that started five years ago, some residents have raised concerns among friends, on social media and to reporters about government oversight in building maintenance projects and official investigation efforts.",
      "Nearly 40% of incumbents, including household names and mildly vocal politicians, are stepping aside for this election. More candidates with mainland Chinese business links, as well as more members of China\u2019s parliament, are joining the race.",
      "Observers suggest the candidate lineup signals Beijing\u2019s tightening control over even its loyalists and a preference for politicians more in tune with its agenda.",
      "Starting in late September, many veteran lawmakers announced one by one that they would not seek reelection. Regina Ip, a leading member of Hong Kong\u2019s cabinet, said she wanted to pass the torch to the younger generation and denied that age was a factor.",
      "Several relatively outspoken lawmakers also stepped aside. One of them, Doreen Kong, insisted she faced no pressure to bow out.",
      "The changes drew wide attention to the legislature, now filled with Beijing loyalists after China overhauled electoral rules in 2021.",
      "Under the rules, the number of directly elected seats was reduced from 35 to 20. Forty other seats are chosen by a predominantly pro-Beijing election committee, with voters in professional, business and other designated sectors picking another 30 for their industries. All candidates must pass official vetting, including by national security authorities.",

      "The pro-Beijing camp praised the new model\u2019s efficiency, but Hong Kong think tank POD Research Institute in September said its survey showed growing public concerns about the quality of debate in the legislature.",
      "The new candidate pool marks a deeper change.",
      "The Associated Press found that at least 26 of 161 candidates, or 16%, held positions in Chinese-funded businesses without declaring party affiliations \u2014 almost double the figure reported by local newspaper South China Morning Post in the 2021 election. Most were connected to state-owned enterprises.",
      "Among all candidates, 16 are delegates to China's top legislature \u2014 more than double from the last election \u2014 and 13 others are members of China's top political advisory body. The directly-elected seats drew more candidates than four years ago, including district councilors handling municipal matters. Still, many of those new candidates are not familiar names to voters.",
      "John Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong, said the central government has \u201cvery much controlled\u201d the city's elections since 2021. Burns said it appears that the central authorities have a new informal criterion on an upper age limit and possibly less appetite for outspoken lawmakers.",
      "He said members of China's legislature and political advisory body are more in tune with Beijing's agenda, while those who work for state-owned enterprises are under more control by the central authorities, in addition to having better resources for their roles.",

      "German lawmakers have approved the government\u2019s plan to attract more military recruits as the country tries to boost the ranks of its armed forces in the face of rising concern about the threat posed by Russia",
      "BERLIN -- German lawmakers on Friday approved the government's plan to attract more military recruits as the country tries to boost the ranks of its armed forces in the face of rising concern about the threat posed by Russia. The plan also foresees mandatory medical checks for young men.",
      "It stops short of reintroducing conscription, though it leaves open the possibility of compulsory service for at least a limited number should the need arise.",
      "Parliament\u2019s lower house, the Bundestag, approved the plan by 323 votes to 272, with one abstention. It\u2019s a modified version of a plan that Chancellor Friedrich Merz\u2019s Cabinet approved in August.",
      "Germany has committed billions to improving its military\u2019s equipment after years of neglect and the government has turned its attention to trying to persuade more people to join up.",
      "It\u2019s not alone in trying to bolster its armed forces; last week, France unveiled a program to train thousands of volunteers aged 18 and 19 starting next year. Belgium and Poland also have plans to attract more people to train or serve.",
      "Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told lawmakers that \u201cour allies are looking at Germany\u201d and argued that the country has become a \u201cpacesetter for defense in Europe.\u201d He said that, with the new legislation, \u201cwe are taking a further decisive step for our defense capability.\u201d",
      "Germany suspended conscription for men in 2011 and has subsequently struggled to attract large numbers of short-term volunteers. In recent years, the number of military personnel has hovered just above 180,000 \u2014 compared with 300,000 people in 2001, more than a third of whom were conscripts.",
      "Now the government wants to raise the figure to 260,000 over the next decade. It says it will also need around 200,000 reservists, more than double the current figure.",
      "The plan approved Friday foresees more attractive pay and conditions for people who join up on a short-term basis, better training and more flexibility on how long people can serve, starting from a minimum of six months.",
      "The aim is to draw enough recruits without reviving compulsory service, an idea unpopular with the center-left junior partner in Merz\u2019s coalition.",
      "But the plan leaves the door open for parliament to introduce mandatory service at least for a limited number of people, possibly selected at random, \u201cparticularly if the defense policy situation or the personnel situation of the armed forces make this necessary.\u201d Many in Merz\u2019s conservative bloc think that conscription will ultimately be needed.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV has taken his biggest step yet to correct one of Pope Francis\u2019 more problematic financial moves, canceling a special Holy See fundraising commission that was announced under questionable circumstances while Francis was hospitalized.",
      "Leo on Thursday formally suppressed the fundraising commission, abrogated its statutes and fired its members. He decreed that its assets would go to the Holy See as a whole, and that the Vatican patrimony office would oversee the commission\u2019s extinction.",
      "A new working group would be formed, with papally approved members, to come up with fundraising proposals and an appropriate structure going forward, the decree said.",
      "The decree was the latest sign that as 2025 comes to an end, history's first American pope is wrapping up the loose ends of Francis' pontificate. Leo is correcting problems as needed and fulfilling Francis' Holy Year obligations, as he looks ahead to the new year when he can focus more on his own agenda.",
      "The Vatican had announced the creation of the commission, its statutes and members on Feb. 26, while Francis was in the hospital battling double pneumonia. At the time, he was being visited by the top officials of the Secretariat of State.",
      "The commission included only Italians with no professional fundraising experience. Its president was the assessor of the Secretariat of State, the very same Vatican office that Francis had previously stripped of its ability to manage assets after it lost tens of millions of euros in a scandalous London property deal.",

To some, it smacked of the Italian-led Secretariat of State taking advantage of a sick pope to announce a new flow of unchecked donations into its coffers after Francis took its 600 million-euro ($684 million) sovereign wealth fund away and gave it to another office to manage as punishment for the London fiasco.",
      "The decree by the American pope thus appears to be an effort to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration will start sending more water to California farmers in the state's crop-rich Central Valley",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration is making good on a promise to send more water to California farmers in the state\u2019s crop-rich Central Valley.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Thursday announced a new plan for operating the Central Valley Project, a vast system of pumps, dams and canals that direct water southward from the state\u2019s wetter north. It follows an executive order President Donald Trump signed in January calling for more water to flow to farmers, arguing the state was wasting the precious resource in the name of protecting endangered fish species.",
      "Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the plan will help the federal government \u201cstrengthen California\u2019s water resilience.\" It takes effect Friday.",
      "But California officials and environmental groups blasted the move, saying sending significantly more water to farmlands could threaten water delivery to the rest of the state and would harm salmon and other fish.",
      "Most of the state\u2019s water is in the north, but most of its people are in the south. The federally-managed Central Valley Project works in tandem with the state-managed State Water Project, which sends water to cities that supply 27 million Californians. The systems transport water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, an estuary that provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife including salmon and the delta smelt.",
      "It is important for the two systems to work together, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a statement. She warned the Trump administration\u2019s plan could limit the state's ability to send water to cities and farmers. That is because the state could be required to devote more water to species protection if the federal project sends more to farms.",
      "Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director at Restore the Delta, said pumping more water out would result in more Delta smelt and juvenile salmon dying from getting stuck in the pumping system, and once the temperature warms, harmful algae blooms will develop that are dangerous to fish, wildlife, pets and people. That could have economic impacts, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you destroy water quality and divorce it from land, you are also destroying property values,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to live near a fetid, polluted backwater swamp.\u201d",
      "The Bureau of Reclamation denied the changes would harm the environment or endangered species.",
      "The Central Valley Project primarily sends water to farms, with a much smaller amount going to cities and industrial use. Water from the Central Valley Project irrigates roughly one-third of California agriculture, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "The Westlands Water District, one of the largest uses of Central Valley Project water, cheered the decision. It \u201cwill help ensure that our growers have the water they need to support local communities and the nation\u2019s food supply, while also protecting California\u2019s wildlife,\u201d general manager Allison Febbo said in a statement.",

He called for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom \u201cto file a lawsuit to challenge this unlawful federal move.\u201d",
      "During Trump's first term, he allowed more water to be directed to the Central Valley, a move that Newsom fought in court, saying it would push endangered delta smelt, chinook salmon and steelhead trout populations to extinction.

Newsom did not immediately comment Thursday on the new decision.",

      "The government picked a company with little experience working with the Federal Aviation Administration called Peraton to oversee the roughly $31.5 billion overhaul of the outdated air traffic control system",
      "The government picked a company with little experience working with the Federal Aviation Administration called Peraton to oversee the roughly $31.5 billion overhaul of the outdated air traffic control system.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday evening that Peraton was chosen in the hope that its innovative approach will make it possible to complete the upgrades within the next three years before the end of President Donald Trump's term in office ends. Peraton was chosen over Parsons Corp., which does have extensive experience with FAA contracts.",
      "\u201cWorking together, we are going to build on the incredible progress we\u2019ve already made and deliver a state-of-the-art air traffic control system that the American traveling public \u2014 and our hard-working air traffic controllers \u2014 deserve,\u201d Duffy said in the announcement.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the modernization project and the company hired to oversee it:",
      "Earlier this year, Congress approved $12.5 billion as a down payment on the project after technical problems twice knocked out the radar for air traffic controllers managing planes around Newark Liberty International Airport. This year began with the worst American aviation disaster in years when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington D.C., killing 67 people.",
      "Duffy has said he'll need roughly $20 billion more to complete the upgrade.",
      "This effort to upgrade the technology controllers use is on a much more aggressive timeline than the previous NextGen effort that began shortly after the turn of the century and failed to deliver all the benefits it promised even after an investment of $36 billion. The Biden administration had estimated that upgrading the system might take more than a decade.",
      "The FAA hasn't yet released the details of how much Peraton will be paid for this contract, but the agency said it includes incentives to reward good performance and penalties for shortcomings.",
      "The technical problems that disrupted flights at the Newark airport in the spring demonstrated just how fragile the nation's aging air traffic control system is. And Duffy has said those kind of technical failures in a system that too often still relies on copper wires and floppy discs could happen anywhere unless the system is upgraded.",
      "Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed in Newark. After the radar outages, the facility in Philadelphia that controls the flights in and out of Newark had a half dozen controllers go on leave, which forced the reductions in flights.",
      "The number of flights across the country each day that the FAA has to safely manage is expected to continue growing in the years ahead. And drones will continue to proliferate across the country as flying taxis start to take to the air.",
      "Everyone agrees that the air traffic control system must be modernized to be able to handle those future demands.",
      "John Rose, chief risk adviser for global travel management company ALTOUR, said the three-year timeline is \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d but partially realistic. He said it\u2019s plausible for the FAA to build the foundation for a modern air traffic control network in its tight timeline, with more advanced capabilities layered on later.",
      "\u201cYou need to build the base before you can have all the bells and whistles,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the project gets to the core structure in three years, I think we\u2019ve accomplished the mission.\u201d",
      "He likened it to an iPhone where once you have a robust base system you can upgrade the software like when the phone gets an iOS update. \u201cIf they build the infrastructure, then as things change from a technology capability, it\u2019s almost like a plug and play,\u201d he said.",
      "Air Traffic Control Association President and CEO Stephen Creamer represents the companies that make the gear that Peraton and the FAA will use to complete the upgrades. He said it helps that the new system won't have to be built from scratch.",

      "Peraton has worked on multibillion-dollar technology contracts for the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Special Operations Command and the National Park Service along with the military and other agencies.",
      "The company is owned by Veritas Capital private equity firm, so it doesn't have shareholders. Its board of advisers is full of an assortment of former military and intelligence officials. A Peraton spokesman said the company was too busy getting started on the contract to do any interviews Friday, but its CEO Steve Schorer promised in a statement that his team is committed to completing this project.",
      "\u201cOur highly-skilled, dedicated, and talented team of engineers, technologists, and mission experts stands ready to hit the ground running to deliver a system Americans can count on \u2014 one that is more secure, more reliable, and a model for the world to follow,\u201d Schorer said.",
      "The company's political action committee donated a quarter-million dollars to politicians last year with a little over half of that going to Republicans, according to www.opensecrets.org.",
      "Duffy said that the FAA has already been working on making improvements and more than one-third of the old copper wires that air traffic controllers were relying on have been replaced with fiber optic lines or other modern connections.",
      "But some of the advancements like installing new systems to help controllers keep track of planes on the ground at 44 airports began during the last administration.",
      "And significant work remains ahead to install more than 27,600 new radios and 612 new radar systems. The old connections still need to upgraded at thousands of additional facilities, and six new air traffic control centers are scheduled to be built.",

      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Somali migrant Mohamed Abdi Awale endured horrors on an ill-fated journey across Africa to seek a better life in the West \u2014 but he's determined to try again one day, even aiming for the U.S. despite increasing restrictions.",
      "Awale is one of 165 Somali migrants recently repatriated after being detained in Libya, where the International Organization for Migration says those caught on journeys to Europe face \u201cunacceptable and inhumane conditions.\u201d",
      "Awale undertook a more than 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) journey, leaving Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, to cross Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan.",
      "He was captured by smugglers near the Sudan-Libyan border and taken to the Sahara oasis town of Kufra, where captors filmed him being tortured in a bid to extract a ransom from his family.",
      "\u201cTorture became normal,\u201d Awale said. \u201cIf you failed to pay, they beat you until you fainted. Some people lost their minds. Others didn\u2019t survive.\u201d",
      "Unable to afford the ransom, his mother, Hawo Elmo Rage, turned to social media, pleading with Somalis at home and abroad to help her save her son.",

      "\u201cI thought we would die there,\u201d Awale said.",
      "The group was then detained outside of Tripoli, and Awale spent a month in prison in the coastal town of Sirte and another two months in detention in Tripoli before his repatriation to Somalia in November.",
      "Awale became one of hundreds of thousands of Somalis that have fled the country in more than three decades of civil war, according to UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency, which estimates that another 3.5 million people are displaced within Somalia itself.",

It's one of many once-thriving Hispanic businesses, from Nicaraguan eateries to Honduran restaurants, emptied out in recent weeks in neighborhoods with lots of signs in Spanish but increasingly fewer people on the streets.",
      "In the city of Kenner, which has the highest concentration of Hispanic residents in Louisiana, a federal immigration crackdown aiming for 5,000 arrests has devastated an economy already struggling from ramped-up enforcement efforts this year, some business owners say, and had far-reaching impacts on both immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.",
      "\u201cFewer and fewer people came,\u201d said a crying Diaz, whose Taqueria La Conquistadora has been closed for several weeks now with both customers and workers afraid to leave home. \u201cThere were days we didn\u2019t sell anything. That\u2019s why I made the decision to close the business \u2014 because there was no business.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, convoys of federal vehicles began rumbling back and forth down Kenner's main commercial streets as the Department of Homeland Security commenced the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations that have included surges in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Bystanders have posted videos of federal agents detaining people outside Kenner businesses and at construction sites.",
      "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino also made an appearance in the city, surrounded by agents in tactical gear, to tout to reporters the launch of the operation dubbed Catahoula Crunch, a name derived from the big game hound that is the Louisiana state dog.",
      "The state's Hispanic population has boomed in the last two decades, with many of them arriving in the aftermath of 2005's Hurricane Katrina to help rebuild. In Kenner, just west of New Orleans between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, Hispanics make up about 30% of residents.",
      "Diaz, who is from El Salvador, arrived in 2006 after years of doing farm work in Texas. She opened food trucks, earning enough to buy a home in Kenner, and her business has since expanded to a fleet of trucks and two brick-and-mortar restaurants.",
      "Nearly all that is shuttered at the moment due to the crackdown, and Diaz is scraping by through making home deliveries to people fearful of being swept up by agents.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t respect anyone,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cThey don\u2019t ask for documents. They don\u2019t investigate. They slap the handcuffs on them and take them away.\u201d",
      "Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday that federal agents have already made dozens of arrests, though the agency has not released a full list of people detained.",
      "\u201cAmericans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens harming them, their families, or their neighbors,\u201d McLaughlin said in a statement. \u201cIn just 24 hours on the ground, our law enforcement officers have arrested violent criminals with rap sheets that include homicide, kidnapping, child abuse, robbery, theft, and assault.\u201d",

      "The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans\u2019 access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.",

      "The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"From day one I\u2019ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.\u201d Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.",
      "The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was \u201ca win for customers and common sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs America\u2019s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump\u2019s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,\u201d he said.",
      "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration\u2019s actions to \u201crealign\u201d the mileage standards \u201cwith real world market conditions.\u201d",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.",
      "Environmentalists decried the rollback.",
      "\u201cIn one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation\u2019s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "\u201cGutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,'' said Katherine Garc\u00eda, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program. \u201cThis rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV \u201cmandate,\u201d referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.",

In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.",

      "After riding the artificial intelligence craze to new heights, business software maker Salesforce has been pummeled by a wave of investor skepticism that\u2019s intensified the pressure on its persuasive CEO Marc Benioff to reverse the tide",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- After riding the artificial intelligence craze to new heights, business software maker Salesforce has been pummeled by a wave of investor skepticism that\u2019s intensified the pressure on its persuasive CEO Marc Benioff to reverse the tide.",
      "Benioff, who helped spearhead the transition to cloud computing after founding Salesforce in 1999, got a chance to try to change the AI narrative late Wednesday with the release of his company\u2019s latest quarterly results.",
      "The key numbers covering the August-October eclipsed the analyst projections that help steer the stock market, providing Benioff with some material to support his contention that Salesforce\u2019s big bets on AI will yield a jackpot. The San Francisco-based company earned $2.1 billion, or $2.19 per share, a 37% increase from the same time last year while revenue rose 9% to nearly $10.9 billion. Salesforce also provided an outlook for the current quarter ending in January that exceeded analysts' predictions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uniquely positioned for this new era,\u201d Benioff boasted during a 25-minute address on an analyst conference call that sometimes sounded like an AI sermon that also featured comments about \u201cwow\u201d moments that customers experience when seeing the company's technology.",
      "Salesforce\u2019s shares initially surged by more than 5% after the results came out, but backtracked to a gain of 2% following Benioff's presentation.",
      "It's unclear if that modest momentum will be sustained in Thursday's regular trading session because making more money than analysts anticipated isn\u2019t necessarily enough to keep propelling a technology stock amid persisting doubts about whether the hundreds of billions of dollars being poured into the much-hyped technology will pay off.",
      "Nvidia, the dominant maker of the chips needed to power AI, put a dent in the wall of worry a couple weeks ago with a quarterly earnings report that soared far beyond analyst estimates and initially eased fears about a Big Tech bubble bursting.",
      "But the tranquility quickly evaporated, leaving Nvidia\u2019s stock price slightly below where it was trading before the company\u2019s stellar earnings report and 15% below its peak price reached in late October when the chipmaker became the first company to be valued at $5 trillion.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Social media platforms must report monthly how many children\u2019s accounts they close once Australia begins enforcing its 16-year age limit next week, a minister said Wednesday.",
      "Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) from Dec. 10 if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Livestreaming service Twitch was added to the list of age-restricted platforms less than two weeks ago.",

      "Google said Wednesday that anyone in Australia under 16 would be signed out of its platform YouTube from Dec. 10 and lose features accessible only to account holders such as playlists.",

      "\u201cWe have consistently said this rushed legislation misunderstands our platform, the way young Australians use it and, most importantly, it does not fulfill its promise to make kids safer online,\u201d a Google statement said.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said suspected young children will be removed from those platforms from Thursday.",

      "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show earlier this year featured a stage design resembling a giant PlayStation controller",
      "NEW YORK -- When Kendrick Lamar began his Super Bowl halftime show earlier this year, he picked a stage design likely familiar to anyone tuning in: a square, triangle, cross and circle.",
      "The Grammy-winning rapper \u2014 in front of more than 133 million people \u2014 chose to perform on a massive, industrialized grid of flashing lights resembling a giant PlayStation controller.",
      "It was a nice surprise present for Sony's PlayStation, which this year is celebrating its 30th anniversary in North America and Europe. Lamar's nod to the console \u2014 which Sony had nothing to do with \u2014 was another sign of how far the brand has penetrated the culture, in ways big and small.",
      "From big-budget Hollywood fare like \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d starring Angelina Jolie, to Juice WRLD's video for \u201cHear Me Calling\u201d to \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d on HBO Max, the PlayStation experience has leapt far past the console. Chandler Bing on \u201cFriends\u201d played a PlayStation 1 and the title character fired at PlayStation zombies in the cult movie \u201cShaun of the Dead.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe made gaming cool. When we came out we were a little edgy, we were a different, but it was really about being disruptive,\u201d says Eric Lempel, senior vice president for marketing, sales and business operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment. \u201cWe feel we are a premier entertainment brand, not just a gaming brand.\u201d",
      "Part of the enduring popularity of the PlayStation has been its ability to evolve with the technology, starting in 1995 by picking CD-ROMs that opened the door to 3D gaming. At the time, clunky cartridges were king.",
      "The PlayStation \u2014 sparked by a failed partnership between Nintendo and Sony \u2014 entered a marketplace dominated by Sega and Nintendo. Sony wanted to bring the arcade experience home and a crucial decision was to consult with game developers first, before building their system.",
      "\u201cSony realized they needed developers in place from the get-go before they even started designing it,\u201d says Anthony Caulfield, who with his wife, Nicola, run Gracious Films and made the independent documentary \u201cThe PlayStation Revolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cHardware manufacturers up to that point basically didn\u2019t care what the developers wanted. They just made what they thought was the best piece of hardware,\u201d he says.",
      "Some critical steps helped right from the launch. Sony had a number of games ready to go, a development pipeline in place and a killer retail price \u2014 $299 \u2014 that was less expensive than the rival Sega Saturn.",
      "Sony also picked its market carefully, Caulfield says. With Sega and Nintendo largely targeting children, Sony aimed the PlayStation at teens and young adults \u2014 catnip for their younger brothers and sisters.",
      "\u201cIf you grew up loving Nintendo games, the PlayStation was like a really good next step,\u201d says Tyler Treese, the editor-in-chief of PlayStation LifeStyle, an online forum and news site for fans.",
      "When the console first arrived, it was a sensation, going on to sell more than 100 million units globally. \u201cIt\u2019s when games grew up,\u201d says Caulfield. \u201cIt\u2019s where the gaming went from the bedroom to the living room.\u201d",
      "Sony kept up with the technology, packing a DVD into the PlayStation 2 so that buyers had another reason to buy the system. The PlayStation 2 remains the best selling console of all time, with some 160 million units sold.",

      "Sony hit a wobble with the PS3, which used a Blu-ray deck. \u201cIt made the thing so expensive and it kind of broke that original PlayStation feeling of availability and great value for money,\u201d Caulfield says. The 2011 PlayStation network hack that shut down the network for 24 days didn't help. \u201cIf they got the PS4 wrong it could have been the end.\u201d",
      "But the PlayStation 4 in 2013 stabilized the console, offering immersive online multiplayer options, streaming services and a library of exclusive games. Sony kept going with in-app purchases, 4K resolution and a controller that has haptic feedback and adaptive triggers in the current PlayStation 5.",
      "\u201cEvery console has to have a purpose, it has to have a reason to exist, and when we find that we have the right amount of new technology that can enable developers to do great things, we push forward,\u201d says Lempel.",
      "The list of movies and TV shows that have had their origin on the PlayStation is long. It includes: \u201cUncharted\u201d starring Tom Holland on the big screen, \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d with Pedro Pascal on HBO, \u201cTwisted Metal\u201d on Peacock and \u201cGran Turismo\u201d with Orlando Bloom from Columbia Pictures.",

      "Treese says PlayStation games often make the leap to TVs and theater screens because they're realistic, use motion capture and employ talented actors.",
      "\u201cThey do really lend themselves to movies because they definitely led that charge of making more cinematic video game experiences,\u201d he says. It also doesn't help that Sony Pictures is nearby.",
      "Lempel says PlayStation franchises are finding new audiences in other media because, at base, they're good entertainment. \u201cWe have great stories, we\u2019ve got great IP, and it transcends the category.\u201d",
      "That has even spilled out into fashion \u2014 British Nigerian multidisciplinary artist and designer Yinka Ilori has a line of PlayStation-inspired loungewear \u2014 and footwear, thanks to rapper Travis Scott's Nike Dunk Low Cactus Jack X PlayStation sneakers.",
      "\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve struck a chord that goes just well beyond a consumer product,\u201d says Lempel. \u201cThis is something that people love. It\u2019s a big part of people\u2019s lives and they love to talk about it. They love to express it in different ways.\u201d",
      "Lempel recently got a taste of that expression firsthand. He was at a restaurant in Manhattan when he spotted the PlayStation symbols tattooed on someone\u2019s arm. \u201cThese are permanent markings on someone\u2019s body,\u201d he says in wonder. \u201cThat\u2019s the passion people have.\u201d",

      "Huang's closed-door meeting with Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee came at a moment of intensifying lobbying, soaring investments and audacious forecasts by major tech companies about AI\u2019s potential transformative effects.",
      "Huang is among the Silicon Valley executives who warn that any restrictions on the technology will halt its advancement despite mounting concerns among policymakers and the public about AI's potential pitfalls or the ways foreign rivals like China may use American hardware.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\u201d Huang told reporters before his meeting on Capitol Hill.",

      "\u201cWe need to be able to compete around the world. The one thing we can\u2019t do is we can\u2019t degrade the chips that we sell to China. They won\u2019t accept that. There\u2019s a reason why they wouldn\u2019t accept that, and so we should offer the most competitive chips we can to the Chinese market,\u201d Huang said.",

I don\u2019t blame you for that, but if I\u2019m looking for someone to give me objective advice about whether we should make our technology available to China, he's not it.\"",

      "A baby and his family dog sit across from each other in a podcast studio.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the talking baby podcast,\u201d says the infant, wearing headphones and sounding like a deep-voiced radio broadcaster. \u201cOn today\u2019s episode, we\u2019ll be talking to the weird-looking person who lives at my house.\u201d",
      "So begins a series of humorous interactions between two characters animated by artificial intelligence that's attracted millions of views on social media. They\u2019re a nod to the 1989 movie \u201cLook Who\u2019s Talking\u201d but produced in a matter of hours and without a multimillion-dollar Hollywood budget.",
      "AI helped do all of that, but it didn't craft the punch lines. It\u2019s a relief to comedian Jon Lajoie, who made the videos, that AI chatbots just aren\u2019t \u201cinherently funny.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can't write comedy,\u201d said Lajoie. \u201cIt can't do any of that.\u201d",
      "For now, at least, they won\u2019t take his job.",
      "Lajoie\u2019s viral videos have gained him attention as an AI-adopting entertainer that\u2019s he\u2019s not entirely comfortable with as he grapples with what all this means for the future of his very human craft of making people laugh.",
      "King Willonius is not feeling so cautious. His first big hit was an AI-generated song called \u201cBBL Drizzy\u201d that made fun of rapper Drake during the height of his feud with Kendrick Lamar. He's since moved into making AI video parodies like \u201cI\u2019m McLovin It (Popeye\u2019s Diss Song)\u201d and \u201cI Want My Barrel Back (Cracker Barrel song).\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very similar to somebody who\u2019s writing for The Onion or SNL,\u201d Willonius said. \"I try to find out, OK, what\u2019s my comedic angle on this particular topic? And then I\u2019ll generate a video from that.\"",
      "He starts with writing his own notes on an idea, then refines it with a chatbot, and puts that language \u2014 known as a prompt \u2014 into AI tools that can generate imagery, video, music and voices. The key, he says, is to keep iterating.",
      "But he wouldn't just ask it for a joke \u2014 Willonius says most chatbot-generated comedy lacks the \u201cnuances or complexities that it takes for jokes to really land.\u201d",
      "A scholar of comedy, Michelle Robinson, said \u201ca lot of the stuff that I\u2019ve seen AI produce is corny as hell.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt does seem fluent in the basic grammar of jokes, but sometimes they\u2019re slightly off,\u201d said Robinson, a professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cThey may be moderately funny, but I think they\u2019re really missing an important element of what makes us laugh.\u201d",
      "What are they missing? She's not totally sure, except that most good jokes are a little edgy or dangerous and chatbots can't seem to calibrate \u201cwhatever provocation is in the joke to the moment that we\u2019re living in.\u201d",
      "Caleb Warren, a professor who studies marketing and consumer psychology at the University of Arizona, said that leaves comedy writers with an opportunity to make use of tools that can't completely outsource their skills.",
      "\u201cThe ideas that are driving the humor are coming from the human comedian,\u201d but the AI tools can help them execute and illustrate them, Warren said.",

      "\u201cI leaned all the way into AI because I didn\u2019t know what else to do with my free time,\u201d he said. \u201cI was doing everything I could to try to break into Hollywood. And once the writers' strike happened, that kind of shut that down. I started to learn these AI tools and get really good at them and started to cultivate an audience.\u201d",
      "While Willonius saw an opening, the rise of generative AI has stoked division and posed challenges to other professional comedians.",
      "Sarah Silverman joined book authors in suing leading chatbot makers, alleging they infringed the copyright of her \u201cThe Bedwetter\u201d memoir. The daughter of the late Robin Williams called it \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cmaddening\u201d when users of OpenAI's AI video generator Sora conjured up realistic \u201cdeepfakes\u201d of the beloved actor to churn out what she described as \u201chorrible TikTok slop puppeteering.\u201d",

      "Lajoie, known for his work on the TV series \u201cThe League\u201d and comic songs on YouTube, tried to see what would happen if he asked ChatGPT to help craft a bizarre movie script idea. He said it gave him something \u201csuper boring\u201d about \u201cgrandma's dentures and a talking raccoon.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat level of human creativity, it can\u2019t mimic \u2014 yet \u2014 or at least maybe I\u2019m not great at prompting,\u201d he said. Instead, he found it useful to cheaply animate ideas he would otherwise never have pursued \u2014 such as the talking baby, birds wearing jeans, or a podcasting Jesus Christ interviewing an Easter Bunny who\u2019s never heard of him.",
      "The prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invited Lajoie and Willonius to exhibit their video creations this fall at a new AI gallery space in Manhattan, part of a promotion of AI creativity tool startups that the firm invests in.",
      "Willonius obliged. Lajoie ended up bowing out, after an interview with The Associated Press in which he voiced doubts about what he described as AI's \u201cNapster phase.\u201d The music-sharing website shuttered in the early 2000s after the record industry and rock band Metallica sued over copyright violations.",
      "The investment firm's co-founder, Marc Andreessen, has been bullish about AI's potential to bring new life into filmmaking and comedy. On a November podcast, he blamed Hollywood opposition to its adoption on \u201cwoke activists (who) have picked up AI as the new thing they\u2019re going to agitate about.\u201d He compared it to resistance to computer graphics in movies before they became commonplace.",
      "Lajoie said he shared his early AI video experiments with a few friends who are \u201canti-AI; real, real, anti-AI\u201d and they were surprised by how well the sketches retained Lajoie's own comedic voice.",
      "He insists he's no AI expert, just \u201ca creative person who can figure out how to make two characters talk to each other.\u201d But even editing the sketches requires understanding comedic timing, and he has no interest in ceding that part to a machine.",
      "\u201cThe thing with comedy is it\u2019s so related to performance, delivery and point of view,\u201d Lajoie said. \u201cDo AIs have a point of view? They can grab a few points of view from different people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd when it does have a point of view, I think that\u2019s when we all should be afraid for all of the reasons that the Terminator has taught us,\u201d he said.",

      "Conservationists are hoping to strengthen regulations at a wildlife trade conference on birds, reptiles and other animals that are seeing their numbers decline due to the exotic pet trade",
      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "\u201cIn theory, under CITES rules, the countries issuing those export permits should be checking that these animals, and crucially their parentage all the way back to the founder stock, were legally acquired in order for an export permit to be granted,\u201d Collis said. \u201cBut that is not happening.\"",
      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",
      "The CITES proposals draw attention to a long-running problem with captive breeding of exotic species, according to Lieberman of the Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",
      "A proposal has also been submitted at the convention to regulate the trade in more than a dozen species of tarantulas. Bolivia, Argentina and Panama note they are \u201camong the most heavily traded groups of invertebrates\u201d with more than half all species available online. The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",
      "The United States Association of Reptile Keepers opposes the tarantula listing, which it called \u201cincongruous\u201d for rolling many species into a single proposal.",
      "The association, which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians, suggested other reptile proposals reflect government overreach, noting the proffered changes to iguana sales are unnecessary since current regulations \u201cprovide adequate protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost species have limited trade in captive bred specimens which is not a threat to wild populations,\u201d David Garcia, the organization's legal counsel and its delegate at the CITES conference, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, many countries, groups, and individuals take the nonsensical position that the way to limit threats to wild populations is to make the captive reproduction of those species more difficult.",
      "But a report from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, shared with The Associated Press and due to be released Dec. 8, found that the United States was among the biggest markets for the pet trade, importing on average 90 million live amphibians, arachnids, birds, aquarium fish, mammals and reptiles each year.",
      "\u201cWildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne million species are on track to face extinction in coming decades unless action is taken to address species loss. Addressing the United States\u2019 role in the exotic pet trade must be a top priority to stem this crisis and protect biodiversity for future generations.\u201d",

      "NEW DELHI -- India\u2019s telecoms ministry has directed smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a government-run cybersecurity app on all new devices, according to a government order, raising concerns of data privacy and user consent in one of the largest handset markets in the world.",
      "The Ministry of Communications' order issued Monday asked smartphone makers to pre-install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app on all new devices within 90 days and to prevent users from deleting it. The order also requires manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update, extending the mandate beyond phones available in the market.",
      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning. It is government testing the waters,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy expert and founder of the tech site MediaNama. \u201cOnce a government app is forcibly pre-installed on our devices, what\u2019s to stop them from pushing future apps that could be used for surveillance?\u201d",
      "Amid growing criticism, India\u2019s telecom minister, Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, on Tuesday called the app a \u201cvoluntary and democratic system\" and said users can choose to activate it and \u201ceasily delete it from their phone at any time.\u201d",

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert is one of the darkest spots on Earth, a crown jewel for astronomers who flock to study the origins of the universe in this inhospitable desert along the Pacific coast.",
      "A rare confluence of factors makes the Atacama an ideal home for some of the world\u2019s biggest ground-based astronomical projects \u2014 dry climate, high altitude and, crucially, isolation from the light pollution of civilization.",
      "\u201cIt's a perfect cocktail for astronomy,\u201d said Daniela Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the Skies of Chile Foundation, a nonprofit that defends the quality of the country\u2019s night skies.",
      "But that may not be the case for much longer, a group of leading scientists warned in an open letter to Chile\u2019s government released Tuesday.",
      "A private company is pressing ahead with plans to construct a giant renewable energy complex in sight of one of Earth\u2019s most productive astronomical facilities \u2014 the Paranal Observatory, operated by an international consortium known as the European Southern Observatory, or ESO.",
      "In the letter, 30 renowned international astronomers, including Reinhard Genzel, a 2020 Nobel laureate in astrophysics who conducted much of his prize-winning research on black holes with the ESO-operated telescopes in the Atacama Desert, describe the project as \u201can imminent threat\u201d to humanity's ability to study the cosmos, and unlock more of its unknowns.",
      "\u201cThe damage would extend beyond Chile\u2019s borders, affecting a worldwide scientific community that relies on observations made at Paranal to study everything from the formation of planets to the early universe,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that economic development and scientific progress can and must coexist to the benefit of all people in Chile, but not at the irreversible expense of one of Earth\u2019s unique and irreplaceable windows to the universe.\u201d",
      "The scientists join a chorus of voices that have been urging the Chilean government to relocate the hydrogen-based fuel production plant since the plan was unveiled a year ago by AES Andes, an offshoot of the American-based multinational AES Corp.",
      "In response to a request for comment, AES Corp. said that its own technical studies showed the project would be fully compatible with astronomical observations and compliant with the Chilean government's strict regulations on light pollution.",
      "\"We encourage trust in the country\u2019s institutional strength, which for decades has guaranteed certainty and environmental protection for multiple productive sectors,\" the company said.",

      "The plan, which is still under environmental review, calls for 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of wind and solar energy farms, a desalination plant and a new port.",
      "That means not only a major increase in light pollution but also new dust, ground vibrations and heightened atmospheric turbulence that blurs stars and makes them twinkle. All of that \u2014 just 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Paranal Observatory\u2019s high-powered telescopes \u2014 will mess the view of key astronomical targets and could obstruct scientific advances, experts say.",
      "\u201cAt the best sites in the world for astronomy, stars don't twinkle. They are very stable, and even the smallest artificial turbulence would destroy these characteristics,\u201d said Andreas Kaufer, the director of operations at ESO, which assesses that the AES project would increase light pollution by 35%.",
      "\u201cIf the sky is becoming brighter from artificial light around us, we cannot do these observations anymore. They're lost. And, since we have the biggest and most sensitive telescopes at the best spot in the world, if they're lost for us, they're lost for everyone.\"",
      "Although this controversy might be specific to Chile, home to 40% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, the project reflects the wider tension between natural darkness and industrialization tearing at countless countries as light pollution makes the night sky about 10% brighter each year.",
      "\u201cMajor observatories have been chased out to remote locations, and essentially now they\u2019re chased out to some of the last remaining dark sky locations on Earth, like the Atacama Desert, the mountain peaks of Hawaii, areas around Tucson, Arizona,\u201d said Ruskin Hartley, the executive director of DarkSky International, a Tuscon-based nonprofit founded by astronomers.",
      "\u201cAll of them are now at risk from encroaching development and mining. It\u2019s happening everywhere.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe tend to overemphasize the role of technology,\u201d said Michael Muthukrishna of the London School of Economics, the report's main author, told reporters. \u201cWe need to ensure it\u2019s not technology first, but it\u2019s people first,\u201d he said, speaking by video at the report\u2019s launch in Bangkok.",
      "The risk of exclusion is an issue for communities where most people are still struggling to access skills, electric power and internet connectivity, for older people, for people displaced by war, civil conflict and climate disasters. At the same time, such people may be \u201cinvisible\u201d in data that will not take them into account, the report said.",
      "\u201cAs a general-purpose technology, AI can lift productivity, spark new industries, and help latecomers catch up,\u201d the report says.",

      "Still, even in wealthy nations like the United States, the potential for data centers to devour too large a share of electricity and water has raised concerns. Ramping up power generation to meet higher demand may hinder progress in limiting the emissions of carbon from burning fossil fuels that contribute to global warming, while also causing health hazards.",

      "Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted \u201cconversations\u201d with customers.",
      "Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season's most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock.",
      "San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce\u2019s director of consumer insights.",

      "Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025:",
      "AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks.",
      "OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for \u201cdetail-heavy\u201d items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said.",
      "Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations.",
      "Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans,",
      "Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed.",
      "\u201cThis is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,\u201d Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart\u2019s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target's app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient.",

      "OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart\u2019s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time.",

Once a product's price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said.",

The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers.",
      "Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said.",

      "AI tools are now being incorporated into how student applications are screened and analyzed, admissions directors say. It can be a delicate topic, and not all colleges are eager to talk about it, but higher education is among the many industries where artificial intelligence is rapidly taking on tasks once reserved for humans.",

      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",

Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

      "A second person will step in if the AI and human reader disagree by more than two points on a 12-point scoring scale.",
      "Like many colleges, Virginia Tech has seen a huge increase in applications since making SATs optional. Last year, it received a record 57,622 applications for its 7,000-seat freshman class. Even with 200 essay readers, the school has struggled to keep up and found itself notifying students later and later.",
      "The AI tool can scan about 250,000 essays in under an hour, compared with a human reader who averages two minutes per essay. Based on last year\u2019s application pool, \u201cWe\u2019re saving at least 8,000 hours,\u201d Espinoza said.",
      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application. But schools say AI tools can help admissions offices eliminate errors in tasks like uploading transcripts and can simplify the process for students.",
      "Georgia Tech this fall is rolling out an AI tool to review the college transcripts of transfer students, replacing the need for staff to enter each course manually into a database. It will allow the school to inform applicants more quickly how many transfer credits they'll receive, cutting down on uncertainty and wait times, said Richard Clark, the school's executive director of enrollment management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more layer of delay and stress and inevitable errors. AI is going to kill that, which I\u2019m so excited about,\u201d Clark said. The school hopes to expand the service soon to all high school transcripts. Georgia Tech also is testing out AI tools for other uses, including one that would identify low-income students who are eligible for federal Pell Grants but may not have realized it.",
      "Stony Brook University in New York is also using artificial intelligence to review applicants' transcripts and testing AI tools for a variety of tasks, like summarizing student essays and letters of recommendation to highlight things an admissions officer should consider, said Richard Beatty, the school\u2019s senior associate provost for enrollment management.",
      "\u201cMaybe a student was fighting a disease sophomore year. Or maybe a parent passed away, or they\u2019re taking care of siblings at home. All these things matter, and it allows the counselors to look at the transcript differently,\u201d Beatty said.",
      "Colleges are interested in AI summaries of transcripts, extracurricular activities and letters of recommendation that tell human readers the students\u2019 story in a more digestible way, said Emily Pacheco, founder of NACAC\u2019s special interest group for AI and admission.",
      "\u201cHumans and AI working together \u2014 that is the key right now. Every step along the way can be greatly improved: transcript reading, essay reviews, telling us things we might be missing about the students,\u201d said Pacheco, a former assistant director of admission at Loyola University Chicago. \u201cTen years from now, all bets are off. I\u2019m guessing AI will be admitting students.\u201d",

      "POINTE-AU-CHIEN, La. -- Cherie Matherne looked out into Bayou Pointe au Chien, wide enough for several boats to pass through. In the distance, a stand of dead trees marked where saltwater comes and goes during storm-driven flooding.",
      "It wasn't always this way. The bayou was once shallower and just wide enough for a small boat to pass. Land that cattle once roamed is submerged now, and elders tell stories of tree canopies once so lush they nearly shut out the day.",
      "The delicate lattice of Louisiana's coastline has been steadily retreating for generations. As it does, the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe and other Indigenous people are fighting to protect what's left and to adapt to their changing environment. That includes a painstaking effort to build makeshift reefs that slow erosion and sturdier homes and buildings to better withstand storms.",
      "\u201cWe want to be able to make it so that people can stay here for as long as possible, for as long as they want to stay,\u201d said Matherne, who as the tribe's director of daily operations helped coordinate its response to the erosion threat.",
      "They hope to avoid the fate of the Jean Charles Choctaw Nation, a nearby tribe that was forced to move three years ago about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north from the encroaching Gulf of Mexico. Isle de Jean Charles \u2014 their island home southwest of New Orleans \u2014 has lost 98% of its land.",
      "Louisiana's coast has been steadily retreating for several reasons.",
      "Levees along the Mississippi River have severed the natural flow of land-creating sand, silt and clay, starving wetlands of sediment they need to survive. Canals have allowed saltwater to flow into wetlands, killing freshwater vegetation that holds them together and accelerating erosion. Groundwater pumping is causing land to sink, and planet-warming emissions from burning coal, oil and gas are fueling hurricanes and accelerating sea level rise.",
      "Since the 1930s, Louisiana has lost about 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land \u2014 sometimes fast, sometimes slow. A U.S. Geological Survey analysis found that when erosion was at its worst, a football field's worth of coastal wetlands was disappearing every 34 minutes.",
      "It\u2019s a difficult problem to solve without being able to count on the Mississippi River to periodically drop sediment to maintain the land, said Sam Bentley, geology professor at Louisiana State University.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to displace ecosystems, it\u2019s going to displace communities, it\u2019s going to isolate infrastructure that\u2019s along the coastline,\" Bentley said. \"And there are going to be a lot of changes that are very hard to deal with.\u201d",
      "Indigenous burial and cultural sites risk eroding, and traditional ways of life \u2014 shrimping, fishing and subsistence farming \u2014 are under pressure. Without action, researchers estimate the state could lose up to 3,000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) \u2014 an area larger than Delaware \u2014 over the next 50 years.",
      "Reefs built from oyster shells are one attempt to stem the erosion.",
      "The oysters are collected from restaurants, stuffed into bags and stacked just off shore to form the reefs. The program, launched in 2014 by the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, has recycled more than 16 million pounds (7.3 million kilograms) of shells in that time. That's enough to protect about 1.5 miles (about 2.4 kilometers) of shoreline.",
      "Since the Pointe-au-Chien tribe had a 400-foot (123-meter) reef built in 2019 to protect a historic mound, the coalition has measured a 50% reduction in the rate of land loss where the reefs were built, said coalition spokesman James Karst.",
      "But there are limits to what reclaimed oyster shells can do. There just aren't enough shells for Louisiana's estimated 7,721-mile (12,426 kilometer) coastline, said Karst, and moving them is expensive, so they have to be strategic. Many reefs they've built protect sites of cultural importance. They're also limited to areas where the water is salty enough for the oyster shells to last.",
      "Their work might seem like a tiny drop in the bucket, \"but when you are losing land at the rate you are,\u201d Karst said, \u201cyou need all the drops in the bucket you can get.\u201d",

It was built at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, a location easy for the public to see and learn about oyster reefs, said Chief Devon Parfait.",
      "When Hurricane Ida hit in 2021, it made landfall in the region with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (241 kph).",
      "Scores of homes in and around Pointe-au-Chien were damaged or destroyed. Some families moved inland or left the area entirely, but most came back. With help from groups like the Lowlander Center, a nonprofit working with Indigenous and coastal communities facing risks such as climate threats and land loss, the tribe is rebuilding in a stronger way.",
      "Homes are higher off the ground and fortified with hurricane straps, heavy-duty windows and doors that can take pummeling winds and waters. Electrical equipment is elevated to stay above storm surge. They've rebuilt or repaired 13 homes; about five new homes are planned and they're raising money to fortify the remaining dozen or so.",
      "\u201cWe know that doing just one home in a community doesn\u2019t make the community safe. It\u2019s only safe if the whole community is included in raising that level of safety,\u201d said Kristina Peterson, director and co-founder of the Lowlander Center.",
      "But challenges remain. The state-recognized tribes have struggled to get federal recognition, they said, and without it, it's hard to get grants and other help from the federal government. Instead, they rely on partnerships with organizations and institutions.",
      "The Trump administration's funding cuts are also making it harder for tribes to meet their goals.",
      "The Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw applied for a federal grant to build a community center stocked with food, water and renewable energy in case of emergencies that's designed to hold up during hurricanes. When cuts happened, their application was tabled.",
      "Similarly, the Pointe-au-Chien applied for money to install solar panels on every home, but they're not hopeful their application will get approved.",
      "Pointe-au-Chien elder Theresa Dardar said much has changed in the five decades she's lived there. The pond behind her home has gotten bigger, and she could once identify lakes Chien and Felicity. Now it\u2019s just one large body of water. People once hunted deer and walked through wooded areas.",
      "What hasn't changed is the quiet and the close ties. Everybody knows everybody. And people still fish like generations did before them.",
      "\u201cThis is where our ancestors were, and we feel like we would be abandoning them\u201d to leave, Dardar said. \u201cWe have sacred sites that we still visit.\u201d",
      "By slowing erosion and building more homes, the tribe hopes younger families will move to Pointe-au-Chien. They also know that protecting their lands from going underwater will protect regions further inland.",
      "As Dardar put it: \u201cWe're the buffer.\"",

      "Two New York City police officers won't be charged in the shooting death of a 19-year-old during a mental crisis last year",
      "Two New York City police officers won't be charged in the shooting death of a 19-year-old man during a mental health crisis last year as his mother and brother begged the officers not to open fire, state Attorney General Letitia James' office said Thursday.",
      "Win Rozario was shot five times by the officers at his family's home in Queens on March 27, 2024, as he came at them while holding scissors in his hand, police body camera video showed. A person in the home had called 911 and told a dispatcher \u201cI think my son is on drugs and is acting mad erratic,\" according to police.",
      "The Office of Special Investigation in James' office concluded in its report that \u201ca prosecutor would not be able to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers\u2019 use of deadly force against Mr. Rozario was justified and, therefore, will not seek charges.\u201d",
      "The report also said that the reasonableness of the fear the officers, Salvatore Alongi and Matthew Cianfrocco, had when Rozario came at them with the scissors could not be disproven beyond a reasonable doubt. Both officers, however, still face an internal discipline trial on excessive force allegations by the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board, as well as a lawsuit by Rozario's family.",
      "Rozario's mother, Notan Eva Costa, his father, Francis Rozario, and his brother, Utsho Rozario, criticized the decision not to prosecute the officers.",
      "\u201cState Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 cowardly decision not to indict NYPD Officers Matthew Cianfrocco and Salvatore Alongi for murdering our beloved son and brother, Win Rozario, feels like we\u2019re watching Win get murdered all over again,\" they said in a statement released by the Justice Committee advocacy group.",
      "\u201cWe were safe in our home until Officers Cianfrocco and Alongi walked in and created chaos,\u201d they said. \u201cThe NYPD should not be engaging with people experiencing a mental health episode.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for reaction to the family's comments Thursday evening.",
      "The Office of Special Investigation's report recommends expanding citywide a pilot program that dispatches paramedics and mental health professionals as first responders to mental health emergency calls. It also recommends more training for officers on responding to such calls. And it says the state should enact a law allowing public health-based responses to people experiencing a mental health, alcohol use or substance use crisis.",
      "Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's platform includes expanding mental health services across the city, including having health professionals respond to mental health crises reported in 911 calls.",
      "\u201cWin Rozario\u2019s death was a senseless tragedy that brought pain to so many New Yorkers, most of all his loved ones,\" Mamdani said in a statement Thursday.",

      "After the officers entered Rozario's home, Rozario grabbed a pair of scissors in the kitchen and took a few quick steps toward the officers, prompting one of them to fire a Taser, the police body camera video showed.

      "KENNER, La. -- The doors of Carmela Diaz's taco joint are locked, the tables are devoid of customers and no one is working in the kitchen. It's one of many once-thriving Hispanic businesses, from Nicaraguan eateries to Honduran restaurants, emptied out in recent weeks in neighborhoods with lots of signs in Spanish but increasingly fewer people on the streets.",
      "In the city of Kenner, which has the highest concentration of Hispanic residents in Louisiana, a federal immigration crackdown aiming for 5,000 arrests has devastated an economy already struggling from ramped-up enforcement efforts this year, some business owners say, and had far-reaching impacts on both immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.",
      "\u201cFewer and fewer people came,\u201d said a crying Diaz, whose Taqueria La Conquistadora has been closed for several weeks now with both customers and workers afraid to leave home. \u201cThere were days we didn\u2019t sell anything. That\u2019s why I made the decision to close the business \u2014 because there was no business.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, convoys of federal vehicles began rumbling back and forth down Kenner's main commercial streets as the Department of Homeland Security commenced the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations that have included surges in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Bystanders have posted videos of federal agents detaining people outside Kenner businesses and at construction sites.",
      "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino also made an appearance in the city, surrounded by agents in tactical gear, to tout to reporters the launch of the operation dubbed Catahoula Crunch, a name derived from the big game hound that is the Louisiana state dog.",
      "The state's Hispanic population has boomed in the last two decades, with many of them arriving in the aftermath of 2005's Hurricane Katrina to help rebuild. In Kenner, just west of New Orleans between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, Hispanics make up about 30% of residents.",
      "Diaz, who is from El Salvador, arrived in 2006 after years of doing farm work in Texas. She opened food trucks, earning enough to buy a home in Kenner, and her business has since expanded to a fleet of trucks and two brick-and-mortar restaurants.",
      "Nearly all that is shuttered at the moment due to the crackdown, and Diaz is scraping by through making home deliveries to people fearful of being swept up by agents.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t respect anyone,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cThey don\u2019t ask for documents. They don\u2019t investigate. They slap the handcuffs on them and take them away.\u201d",
      "Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday that federal agents have already made dozens of arrests, though the agency has not released a full list of people detained.",
      "\u201cAmericans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens harming them, their families, or their neighbors,\u201d McLaughlin said in a statement. \u201cIn just 24 hours on the ground, our law enforcement officers have arrested violent criminals with rap sheets that include homicide, kidnapping, child abuse, robbery, theft, and assault.\u201d",

They say that extended tests that BNSF and Norfolk Southern ran show that safety actually improved even when human inspections were reduced from twice a week to twice a month.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration didn't go quite that far in its decision, but the agency said railroads will be able to cut inspections down to only once a week under the approved waiver.",
      "The railroads had also asked for permission to have up to three days to repair defects identified by the automated inspections. But the Federal Railroad Administration said any serious defects in the tracks must be repaired immediately and all defects should be addressed within 24 hours.",
      "These automated inspection systems use an array of cameras and lasers installed either on a locomotive or on a railcar that can be pulled as part of a train to assess whether the tracks are moving out of alignment or shifting. But the union that represents track inspectors says the technology can\u2019t detect things like the rock underneath the track shifting, vegetation growing into the path of the trains, a crack in the rail or railroad ties rotting out. Plus, inspectors can spot a combination of small defects that might together derail a train where the machine might not register a problem, the union says.",
      "\u201cThis is everyday defects across the entire country that we find through visual inspections that cannot be detected by this machinery,\u201d Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union President Tony Cardwell said. \u201cAnd that technology is not there.

      "Over two years of testing, manual inspections detected only 0.01 defects per 100 miles, compared with the section of the railroad where the test was being run where the combination of the technology and reduced inspections found 4.54 defects per 100 miles.",

      "Cardwell and the union's safety director, Roy Morrison, think that's a bad idea. They said that one of the benefits of frequent inspections is that the inspectors become intimately familiar with their territories, which helps them spot subtle changes. If they aren't out on the tracks as often, it may be harder to spot problems, they said.",
      "\u201cA track inspector who\u2019s out on his mainline track twice a week, he knows that track inside out, and a lot of times he\u2019ll spot a defect without even knowing what he\u2019s looking at yet,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHe\u2019ll get out of the truck and say, hey, there\u2019s something wrong here.

Plus, Norfolk Southern noted in its comments on the request that even if regular inspections aren't being done as often, special inspections will still be done regularly anytime there is a major storm or flooding in a certain area to make sure the tracks weren't affected.",
      "Norfolk Southern said that during its 18-month test of reducing inspections while using the technology, the railroad saw improvements in areas that the automated system can't find because inspectors were free to spend more time focused on those areas.",

      "The state-sanctioned hunt began Saturday, after drawing more than 160,000 applications for a far more limited number of hunting permits, including from opponents who are trying to reduce the number of bears killed in this year's hunt, the state's first since 2015.",
      "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission awarded 172 bear hunt permits by random lottery for this year's season, allowing hunters to kill one bear each in areas where the population is deemed large enough. At least 43 of the permits went to opponents of the hunt who never intend to use them, according to the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, which encouraged critics to apply in the hopes of saving bears.",

      "The Trump administration will start sending more water to California farmers in the state's crop-rich Central Valley",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration is making good on a promise to send more water to California farmers in the state\u2019s crop-rich Central Valley.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Thursday announced a new plan for operating the Central Valley Project, a vast system of pumps, dams and canals that direct water southward from the state\u2019s wetter north. It follows an executive order President Donald Trump signed in January calling for more water to flow to farmers, arguing the state was wasting the precious resource in the name of protecting endangered fish species.",
      "Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the plan will help the federal government \u201cstrengthen California\u2019s water resilience.\" It takes effect Friday.",
      "But California officials and environmental groups blasted the move, saying sending significantly more water to farmlands could threaten water delivery to the rest of the state and would harm salmon and other fish.",
      "Most of the state\u2019s water is in the north, but most of its people are in the south. The federally-managed Central Valley Project works in tandem with the state-managed State Water Project, which sends water to cities that supply 27 million Californians. The systems transport water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, an estuary that provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife including salmon and the delta smelt.",
      "It is important for the two systems to work together, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a statement. She warned the Trump administration\u2019s plan could limit the state's ability to send water to cities and farmers. That is because the state could be required to devote more water to species protection if the federal project sends more to farms.",
      "Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director at Restore the Delta, said pumping more water out would result in more Delta smelt and juvenile salmon dying from getting stuck in the pumping system, and once the temperature warms, harmful algae blooms will develop that are dangerous to fish, wildlife, pets and people. That could have economic impacts, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you destroy water quality and divorce it from land, you are also destroying property values,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to live near a fetid, polluted backwater swamp.\u201d",
      "The Bureau of Reclamation denied the changes would harm the environment or endangered species.",
      "The Central Valley Project primarily sends water to farms, with a much smaller amount going to cities and industrial use. Water from the Central Valley Project irrigates roughly one-third of California agriculture, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "The Westlands Water District, one of the largest uses of Central Valley Project water, cheered the decision. It \u201cwill help ensure that our growers have the water they need to support local communities and the nation\u2019s food supply, while also protecting California\u2019s wildlife,\u201d general manager Allison Febbo said in a statement.",

He called for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom \u201cto file a lawsuit to challenge this unlawful federal move.\u201d",
      "During Trump's first term, he allowed more water to be directed to the Central Valley, a move that Newsom fought in court, saying it would push endangered delta smelt, chinook salmon and steelhead trout populations to extinction. The Biden administration changed course, adopting its own water plan in 2024 that environmental groups said was a modest improvement. Newsom did not immediately comment Thursday on the new decision.",

      "President Donald Trump has long praised tariffs as key to increasing wealth in the United States, idealizing Gilded Age policies that preceded the implementation of a modern federal income tax.",
      "Among the potential benefits, Trump claims, is the ability to replace revenue from federal income taxes with money the U.S. is taking in from tariffs \u2014 a concept he has touted since his 2024 presidential campaign, most recently at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.",
      "But tariff revenue doesn't even come close to where it would need to be if federal income taxes were eliminated, and experts say such a plan isn't at all feasible.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: The U.S. is earning enough revenue from tariffs to eventually eliminate federal income taxes.",
      "THE FACTS: This is false. Individual income taxes brought in trillions more dollars than tariffs did in the last fiscal year, accounting for more than 50% of total U.S. revenue, according to Treasury Department data. Tariffs made up only 3.7% of the total. In the first month of the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, individual income taxes accounted for 54% of total revenue. Tariffs made up 7.75%.",
      "Trump's proposal wouldn't work regardless, according to experts, given the unreliability of tariff revenue as well as the harmful effects of tariffs on economic growth and their outsize impact on lower earners.",
      "\u201cIt's not possible. It's not feasible mathematically or economically,\u201d said Brandon DeBot, senior attorney adviser and policy director at New York University's Tax Law Center. \u201cAnd analysts from a range of different perspectives agree with that conclusion. Even the very substantial tariffs imposed this year, which are at the highest levels in the postwar era, raise nowhere near the revenue that income tax does.\u201d",
      "Steve Wamhoff, federal policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, called the idea \u201cnonsensical.\u201d",
      "But Trump has floated it twice in the last week \u2014 first during remarks on Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago and then again at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting.",
      "\u201cAnd I believe that at some point in the not too distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay. Because the money we're taking in is so great, it's so enormous, that you're not going to have income tax to pay,\u201d he said at the meeting, which lasted more than two hours.",
      "In the last fiscal year, Treasury Department data shows that revenue from individual income taxes was approximately $2.66 trillion out of about $5.23 trillion in total revenue. Corporation income taxes added approximately $452 billion. Customs duties earned nearly $195 billion. That's a difference of around $2.8 trillion.",
      "The current fiscal year is shaping up in a similar fashion. Individual income taxes took in about $217 billion out of approximately $404 billion in total revenue the first month, with about $15 billion in additional funds from corporation taxes. Tariffs, meanwhile, earned around $31 billion.",

      "Trump has boasted of additional income from investments in the U.S. by other countries and international companies. But the precise terms of these investments have yet to be fully codified and released to the public, and some numbers are under dispute or involve potentially fuzzy math.",
      "The modern federal income tax was created with the ratification of 16th Amendment in 1913, ending the 43-year era when Trump says the country was wealthiest. He has not expressly detailed plans to end a national income tax since retaking the White House, and he can\u2019t do so without an act of Congress and upending the federal budget.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\u201d said White House spokesman Kush Desai. He also cited \u201ctrillions in historic investment commitments to make and hire in America\u201d that have been fueled by tariffs.",
      "It is actually importers \u2014 American companies \u2014 that pay tariffs. Those companies typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices \u2014 and sacrifice profits \u2014 to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the United States.",
      "Even if the numbers were made to add up, replacing revenue from federal income taxes with that of tariffs \u2014 a Republican talking point since the 1990s \u2014 poses many risks. Tariffs, especially at rates needed to make up for a loss in federal income taxes, could lead to retaliation from other countries and a lack of imports. In fact, revenue could start going down the more tariffs go up. There is also a lot of uncertainty about how much revenue tariffs will actually take in, given periodic changes to Trump's policies.",
      "\u201cWe would be talking about living in a completely different world than the one we live in now,\u201d said Wamhoff. \u201cThere was a time when the government's finances were provided through tariffs. But I believe people were getting around with a horse and buggy back then and not cars. I mean, that was a completely different time.\u201d",
      "Another reality is currently playing out. Trump's tariffs are the subject of a Supreme Court case and could be struck down if the justices decide he does not have the authority to implement them. However, the president will still have plenty of options to keep taxing imports aggressively even if the courts rule against him. For example, he can reuse tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression. Many companies \u2014 including Costco \u2014 aren't waiting for a decision from the Supreme Court. Instead, they're filing suits against the Trump administration demanding refunds on the tariffs they've paid.",
      "Experts say there is also an issue of fairness, noting that tariffs would shift the tax burden to lower-income households given their propensity to increase costs on consumer goods. Plus, they lack the flexibility of income taxes, which can be set at any desired rate, and they wouldn't allow for incentives such as charitable donations or child tax credits.",
      "\u201cInequality is very highly skewed toward the top,\u201d said Michael Graetz, a professor of tax law at Yale University. \u201cWe've got more billionaires than we've ever had. We've got more millionaires than we've ever had. So it's a strange time to be reducing the tax burden on the top and increasing it on the middle. It's a proposal that is very effective for fundraising for Republicans and it always has been.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled House is holding the first meeting of its select committee on congressional redistricting Thursday, as the state becomes the latest to consider redrawing electoral maps amid a partisan battle for every edge in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "The national wave of redistricting efforts was instigated by President Donald Trump, who hopes to buck the historical trend of the president\u2019s party losing seats in midterms, and his allies are wagering that his adopted home state could yield three to five more seats for Republicans. Each seat is crucial, because Democrats need a net gain of just three to control the chamber.",
      "But the push for redistricting faces major challenges in Florida due to bitter infighting between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and leaders in the GOP-dominated Legislature, along with a provision in the state Constitution that explicitly bars redrawing maps with the intent to \u201cfavor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.\u201d",
      "DeSantis has voiced support for redistricting and even called for a redo of the 2020 U.S. census, claiming that Florida was shortchanged in the count, which determines how many congressional seats each state gets.",
      "\u201cWe are going to press this issue,\u201d DeSantis said in August.",
      "This week, in an interview with online outlet The Floridian, DeSantis floated the possibility of calling lawmakers back in a special session if they do not get redistricting done in the regular session, which is scheduled for Jan. 13 to March 13.",

      "Prominent American playwright and actor, Jeremy O. Harris, known for his Tony-nominated \"Slave Play,\" was arrested in Japan on suspicion of smuggling the psychedelic drug ecstasy, officials said Saturday.",
      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",
      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris' representatives. Harris has not publicly commented on his arrest.",
      "CBS News reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Japan for additional comment.",
      "Japanese criminal procedures allow investigators to keep a suspect in custody for up to 23 days before indictment, and pretrial detention can be prolonged if the accused exercises their right of silence or denies the charges, a practice widely criticized as \"hostage justice.\"",
      "Those convicted of drug smuggling in Japan can face a multiyear prison term.",
      "Harris burst onto the arts scene with \"Slave Play,\" written while he was still a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama. It premiered off-Broadway in 2018, inciting controversy and even a petition to shut down the production with its provocative mix of race, class and sexual taboos. It moved to Broadway the following year, earning a Tony nomination for best play, but did not win an award.",
      "The play returned for a short run on Broadway in December 2021.",
      "\"There haven't been enough chances for us to reflect who we are to the world and to ourselves and to ponder what that reflection means, and so this is what 'Slave Play' gets to do for people,\" Harris told CBS New York in 2021.",

    "story": [
      "Nardiz Cooke was alarmed when she felt a lump in her right breast in late 2018. Her OB-GYN wasn't: Cooke was 38 and had no family history of cancer. Cooke's doctor diagnosed her with fibrosis, a common condition that causes tissue to feel lumpy.",
      "Cooke was reassured, but almost two years later, new symptoms began. She had splitting headaches. She said she was \"vomiting out of the blue.\" Her ears rang. She had double vision and sometimes lost her sight. Once, it took 40 minutes for her vision to return.",
      "But no matter how many doctors Cooke saw, everything came back clear. In October 2021, she went to the emergency room and refused to leave without an answer.",
      "\"After several exams, again, my sight, ears, everything you can imagine, the doctor said, 'You're fine.' I said, 'Doctor, I'm not fine,'\" Cooke recalled.",
      "The doctor ordered an MRI. It showed she had aggressive cancer. Soon after, she was given an official diagnosis: Stage IV metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her brain.",
      "\"It made sense, something about those words \u2014 that was the path that felt right,\" Cooke said.",
      "As she learned about her options, Cooke said she didn't want to focus on worst-case scenarios.",
      "\"It felt like, well, Nardiz, here you go. This is your fate. What are you going to do with it?\"",
      "Focusing on a \"trophy\"",
      "Cooke let herself be swept along the \"pink carpet\" of breast cancer treatment. People who are initially diagnosed with Stage IV cancer often have a poorer prognosis than someone who is diagnosed with earlier-stage disease that grows, said Dr. Carmen Calfa, Cooke's medical oncologist at the University of Miami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Medical advancements and tailored therapies can extend a patient's lifespan, Calfa said, but treatment is lifelong.",
      "Radiation oncologist Dr. Jessica Meshman targeted the tumors in Cooke's brain with radiation therapy. On her first day of treatment, Cooke was intrigued by the custom-fit thermoplastic mask that would direct radiation beams and protect healthy tissue.",
      "\"I saw that thing, that mask, and I said, 'I cannot wait to be done with these treatments, because I'm going to take my mask home, as a symbol, like it's my trophy,\" Cooke said.",
      "Cooke received multiple forms of radiation over two years. When she was feeling claustrophobic inside the spaceship-like machine that delivered the treatment or feeling fatigued and achy at home, she thought about what she would do with the mask when it was no longer needed.",
      "\"This amazing symbol of strength\"",
      "Cooke had her final radiation treatment in late 2022. She had two masks. Several months after finishing treatment, she splurged on quartz crystals.",
      "\"I had no idea. I had no money, but I just bought all these crystals,\" Cooke said. \"I found myself just draping (the mask), adorning (it) in quartz.\"",
      "Cooke thought the glittering results looked like something from a movie or a dream. The next time Cooke met with Meshman, she showed the doctor her photos of the mask. Meshman reached out to administrators at the cancer center to see if Cooke's mask could be displayed there. It was put in the lobby this autumn.",
      "\"I just thought it would be so incredible for other patients to see kind of the strength that she has through the piece,\" Meshman said. \"She took something that can be quite terrifying and made it this amazing symbol of strength.\"",
      "Cooke's project grew as other patients began anonymously donating their masks. She named the collection \"Radiant Sentinels.\" Each mask was a fresh canvas.",
      "\"I have learned so much from each mask, because each mask is a different material, and I research the materials, and they take me to stories, to knowledge. It's very, very interesting,\" Cooke said. \"And I respect the process very much, because that mask, the person that donated that mask, doesn't even know. But I respect them and I wish them the best.\"",
      "\"Never thought of doing something like this\"",
      "Four years after her diagnosis, Cooke, 44, is \"doing amazing,\" Meshman said. Calfa said Cooke is \"blossoming\" and that her ongoing hormone therapy treatment is going well.",
      "Cooke said she follows a four-step regimen: Taking her medication, going to her regular appointments with Calfa and Meshman, working on \"Radiant Sentinels,\" and enjoying a regular glass of red wine.",
      "Cooke's pieces were shown at a Miami gallery on Thursday. Twelve masks \u2014 two of Cooke's and 10 from donors \u2014 were showcased. Calfa and Meshman both attended.",
      "One mask shines with thousands of mirrored glass shards, while another is inspired by a tribal dance from Cooke's hometown in northern Mexico and adorned with naturally shed deer antlers. Another is studded with thousands of tiny religious figures called milagritos.",
      "Other masks are coated in fish scales and seashells. One resembled a knight's helmet wrought with leaves.",
      "Seeing all of the masks gathered and on display was momentous, said Cooke, who comes from a family of artists, but this was her first such effort.",
      "\"I would have never thought of doing something like this with my hands,\" Cooke said. \"I don't have to tell anybody how to feel when they see this. It's their own reflection, their own sight. I am just handing them a candle for them to have their experience with a mask, one-on-one.\"",
      "Cooke said she is continuing to solicit donated masks and will continue to add to the \"Radiant Sentinels\" collection. Cancer changed what she thought her life would look like, but she said it also gave her a new purpose.",
      "\"I'm 44, and I went into full menopause at 40,\" Cooke said. \"That was difficult, but I just gave in. That made a lot of the decisions for me. I did not have any kids. I realized, 'You're not here to have kids. You're here to be an auntie, and you're here to make 'Radiant Sentinels.'\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 19:55:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Netflix on Friday said it will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix on Friday said it is buying Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, merging the biggest streaming service with a storied studio that has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.",
      "In a statement, Netflix said the deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

      "Frank Gehry, the renowned architect who was known for designing the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, has died, a representative confirmed to CBS News. He was 96.",
      "Gehry died Friday in his home in Santa Monica, California, after a brief respiratory illness, Meaghan Lloyd, his chief of staff at Gehry Partners LLP, told CBS News in an email.",
      "He won every major prize that architecture has to offer, including the field's top honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize, for what has been described as \"refreshingly original and totally American\" work.",
      "Gehry's fascination with modern pop art led to the creation of some of the most wildly imaginative buildings ever constructed and brought him a measure of worldwide acclaim seldom afforded any architect.",
      "In addition to Spain's Guggenheim Museum and LA's Walt Disney Concert Hall, his many masterpieces include Berlin's DZ Bank Building and an expansion of Facebook's Northern California headquarters at the insistence of the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. He also designed the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park and the BP Pedestrian Bridge, which connects Millennium Park to Maggie Daley Park.",
      "Other honors include the Royal Institute of British Architects gold medal, the Americans for the Arts lifetime achievement award and his native country's highest honor, the Companion of the Order of Canada.",
      "Years after he stopped designing ordinary looking buildings, word surfaced in 2006 that the pedestrian Santa Monica mall project that had led to his career epiphany might be headed for the wrecking ball. Gehry admirers were aghast, but the man himself was amused.",
      "\"They're going to tear it down now and build the kind of original idea I had,\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Eventually the mall was remodeled, giving it a more contemporary, airy outdoor look. Still, it's no Gehry masterpiece.",
      "Gehry, meanwhile, continued to work well into his 80s, turning out heralded buildings that remade skylines around the world.",
      "The headquarters of the InterActiveCorp, known as the IAC Building, took the shape of a shimmering beehive when it was completed in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood in 2007. The 76-story New York by Gehry building, once one of the world's tallest residential structures, was a stunning addition to the lower Manhattan skyline when it opened in 2011.",
      "That same year, Gehry joined the faculty of his alma mater, the University of Southern California, as a professor of architecture. He also taught at Yale and Columbia University.",
      "Not everyone was a fan of Gehry's work. Some naysayers dismissed it as not much more than gigantic, lopsided reincarnations of the little scrap-wood cities he said he spent hours building when he was growing up in the mining town of Timmins, Ontario.",
      "Princeton art critic Hal Foster dismissed many of his later efforts as \"oppressive,\" arguing they were designed primarily to be tourist attractions. Some denounced the Disney Hall as looking like a collection of cardboard boxes that had been left out in the rain.",
      "Still other critics included Dwight D. Eisenhower's family, who objected to Gehry's bold proposal for a memorial to honor the nation's 34th president. Although the family said it wanted a simple memorial and not the one Gehry had proposed, with its multiple statues and billowing metal tapestries depicting Eisenhower's life, the architect declined to change his design significantly.",
      "If the words of his critics annoyed Gehry, he rarely let on. Indeed, he even sometimes played along. He appeared as himself in a 2005 episode of \"The Simpsons,\" in which he agreed to design a concert hall that was later converted into a prison.",
      "He came up with the idea for the design, which looked a lot like the Disney Hall, after crumpling Marge Simpson's letter to him and throwing it on the ground. After taking a look at it, he declared, \"Frank Gehry, you've done it again!\"",
      "\"Some people think I actually do that,\" he would later tell The AP.",
      "Ephraim Owen Goldberg was born in Toronto on Feb. 28, 1929, and moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1947, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen. As an adult, he changed his name at the suggestion of his first wife, who told him antisemitism might be holding back his career.",
      "Although he had enjoyed drawing and building model cities as a child, Gehry said it wasn't until he was 20 that he pondered the possibility of pursuing a career in architecture, after a college ceramics teacher recognized his talent.",
      "\"It was like the first thing in my life that I'd done well in,\" he said.",
      "He went on to earn a degree in architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954. After serving in the Army, he studied urban planning at Harvard University.",
      "His survivors include his wife, Berta; daughter, Brina; sons Alejandro and Samuel; and the buildings he created.",
      "Another daughter, Leslie Gehry Brenner, died of cancer in 2008.",

      "Father Kavanagh",
      "Pen in hand and his notebook open before him, he was ready to do what he did every November: Get started on his Christmas list.",
      "He had vacated the French desk in the study and adopted the kitchen island as a command center. At the east end of the island, he wrote letters, paid bills, stashed his laptop, and kept a handy trove of books. The west end was reserved for culinary pursuits.",
      "When Cynthia cooked, he often read aloud to her from Mary Oliver, Billy Collins, Wendell Berry, or, out of long affection, George Herbert and Wordsworth. Early on, they agreed that poetry paired well with food prep, fiction worked best after dinner, and nonfiction was for reading alone, silent as a monk.",
      "By seven-thirty a.m., he had prayed with his wife, checked his sugar, had his shot, and polished off his stone-ground oatmeal with raw honey and multigrain toast. This upbeat start on the morning had made him over-confident \u2013 his pen was poised but nothing was happening. The grand expectation of churning through the list was morphing into a muse.",
      "He considered the books spilling out of their allotted space and encroaching on the laptop. Back in the day, which seemed a cool hundred years ago, he'd been a bachelor priest in his slip-covered wingchair, avidly reading through a pile of books. Books were his friends, his family, his mode of travel, his relief from the woes of the vestry.",
      "Somehow, and certainly not by his own effort, he'd gone from a bachelor with blood kin consisting of one lone cousin, Walter, to a family his cousin called 'humongous.' While such a family delivered equally humongous dividends of pleasure, his reading time had taken a hit.",
      "Before Cynthia, he'd been unmoored by the prospect of sharing his time with a wife. How much of his time could a wife possibly need? Now he knew and he did not regret even a minute with his cheerful, artistic, and beautiful wife. He was unmoored no more; but settled in. In a groove, you might say, though definitely not in a rut.",
      "And there was Dooley \u2013 not of his blood, but of his heart. At the age of eleven, Dooley had landed on his doorstep, a thrown-away boy \u2013 barefoot in shredded overalls, with a mouth that a mother of yore would have washed out with soap. Call it a miracle that today his adopted son \u2013 now a successful veterinarian with his own practice \u2013 had a beautiful, artistic wife himself. And two kids that Cynthia and he were over the moon about.",
      "A phenomenal string of events had cast him in roles he'd never dreamed of fulfilling \u2013 father, husband, father-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, great-uncle, grandfather.",
      "There was Jack, a lovable seven-year-old mash-up of cowboy boots and imagination, and Sadie, a going-on-three-year-old who had taken down every defense in her grandpa's arsenal. He'd never given his heart so freely.",
      "With Cynthia, he'd fought giving his heart. There was the inarguable fact that he'd already given it to God \u2013 though only to a certain degree, as he later realized. That had seen him through a decades-long passage until he had a revelation: God's love for his children wasn't just for them to have and to hold, it was to freely, spontaneously give away \u2013 and to gratefully receive from others. Why hadn't he understood this before?",
      "That awakening had opened both his heart and his intellect to a sober realization \u2013 while he'd spent years being afraid to love, he'd been far more terrified of receiving it. He had begun at once to work these truths into daily practice. Not easy. And not overnight. But the process had performed its share of miracles \u2013 had, in fact, at the tender age of sixty-two, gotten him married.",
      "His abandoned French desk, given to him recently by a former parishioner, now displayed an archive of framed family photos. There was Dooley and Lace's Sadie, miraculously born to a mother long pronounced unable to conceive.",
      "A few years ago, he learned he had a half-brother. Out of time and despair, hope and prayer, Henry \u2013 a brother. They both resolved to drop the 'half' business. He and Cynthia had attended Henry's Holly Springs wedding \u2013 an event that gave him a witty and agreeable sister-in-law. He studied the wedding photograph, searching Henry's face for any resemblance to his own. Zero. But they both loved poetry and starched handkerchiefs and letters written in cursive. He had a laugh at the memory of taking Henry by the shoulders, looking him in the eye, and saying, 'Brother, I forgive you for being taller and better-looking.'",
      "To go from a family consisting of a cousin to the present-day slew was a sea change, calling for a new way of dealing with Christmas giving. In years past, he had made a list. Now he must make A List.",
      "Cynthia breezed into the kitchen in a vague cloud of her signature wisteria scent.",
      "'You wear perfume for the grans?'",
      "'Jack says he loves the way his Granny smells \u2013 it makes him sneeze. He also loves making his own picture book. You'll see it soon; it's about bugs. When he turns all that talent loose in the world ... wow! How about your Poetry with Grandpa syllabus?'",
      "'I need one more run through the town library. Poetry for three-year-olds is scarce.' As Lace's mural-painting commissions increased, she needed help with the kids. He and Cynthia were giving a hand when Lily Flower was otherwise employed.",
      "His wife was applying lipstick without the aid of a mirror. It was his job to give a thumbs-up if she hit the mark. She hit the mark while eyeing the kitchen island.",
      "'Could you clean some of the stuff off the counter?' she said. 'It runneth over.'",
      "'I was just thinking that.'",
      "'I'm making pasta for the weekend and ... ' She gestured. ' . . . all those Billy Collins books.'",
      "'But you love Billy Collins.'",
      "'I'm crazy about Billy Collins, but not when I'm making pasta, which takes up gobs of room.'",
      "'Consider it done.'",
      "She gave him a smooch on the cheek. 'Love you, sweetheart.'",
      "'Love you back.'",
      "'Are you off to the hospital?'",
      "'Tomorrow,' he said.",
      "'See you at five, then. Could you pick up a lemon for tonight?'",
      "'Will do. Anything else, give me a shout. Love to the kids. Tell them I'll be out soon.'",
      "'Ooops, I got lipstick on your cheek.'",
      "'Leave it. I'm branded.'",
      "And away she flew, eager for what life had to offer.",
      "He had always started his Christmas list with the nurses. Who could make it without nurses? Not the doctors, not the patients. How many years had he spent plowing up the hill to visit the ever-changing stable of patients, assisted by nurses in his labors of consolation? Even the sour ones had their place in the scheme of things.",
      "And didn't nurses love chocolate? Wasn't that their favorite thing to go home to even if they had a husband who was good-looking and would carry out the garbage? But the rules had shifted when he wasn't looking. He'd been told that what nurses want now is gift certificates. Nurses want to choose their chocolate themselves.",
      "Good for nurses for speaking out and taking charge!",
      "Five gift certificates for chocolate. It felt good just getting that on paper. Unlike his free-ranging wife, he enjoyed the boundaries imposed by a list.",
      "He would save his wife 'til last on the list because she required more than a bit of head-scratching. 'Don't buy me anything,' she said just yesterday. 'I have everything I could possibly want or need. Just write me a love letter. Please, honey.'",
      "He loved it when she called him honey.",
      "He remembered the Year of the Bathrobe \u2013 he had searched for one-hundred-percent cotton with pockets \u2013 she favored pockets \u2013 and matching slippers. Though he was convinced he had a home run, she had seemed ... what? Dismayed wouldn't cover it.",
      "A more recent Christmas gift had its own downside. According to rule, they agreed to give each other one gift only \u2013 no cheating by giving more. It had to be utilitarian, and they had to keep mum so it would be a surprise. She liked surprises.",
      "They had ended up giving each other the same thing \u2013 a smoothie blender. The same make and model. Surprise all around! Hers, however, had been on sale and she had saved thirty bucks. Which meant that he'd be returning the one he bought. All he had to do was hike to the recycle bin in a freezing rain and retrieve the box and dig through the foam peanuts that went berserk all over the place and locate the shipping label and the form that asked why the item was being returned, to which he replied It's a long story, and then rewrap the blasted thing and schlep it to the UPS drop-off.",
      "Looking back, his own biggest want had once been for a world globe, and she had been thrilled to give him one. Years later \u2013 six or seven, maybe \u2013 he was still perfectly satisfied with his globe. Lighted. In a mahogany stand. How could he want more?",
      "'I'd love to give you something you'd really, deeply enjoy,' she said yesterday. 'Something that would make you feel, I don't know, seventeen again?'",
      "'I have her,' he said.",
      "She seemed to like that argument, but still ...",
      "Since they married, he'd written a love letter or two. The one in which he plagiarized a passage from Duff Cooper had been a hit. Cooper had enjoyed a career of writing torrid love letters to his wife, Diana, before dying at sea in '54. But the letter currently under consideration would have to come entirely from his own striving.",
      "Gus was awake and panting at his feet.",
      "The red leash that his hundred-and-ten-pound Bouvier had worn was of course too large for a rescue of thirty-three pounds soaking wet. He had punched a few holes and used his leather cutter to nip the excess.",
      "Out they went into the mountain fog.",
      "So far, November was an unseasonably warm month, not cold enough for a fire in the hearth. This weekend would be different; the temperature was predicted to drop by several degrees, and they had a half-cord of hardwood he was itching to burn.",
      "This was ground fog; those headed down the mountain would be driving the first few miles in a cloud. He was a fog fan. And no wonder \u2013 he was Irish. Gus also had a touch of the Irish. His dog was fond of music, had once lapped up a spilled Guinness at a Meadowgate party, and was inclined to good humor often resulting in a grin.",
      "He had believed grinning dogs merely a staple of YouTube, but now he had one of his own \u2013 who, by the way, could also bark with a ball in his mouth. He absolutely did not deserve such a talented dog.",
      "He spied Emma Newland barreling around the corner with Snickers, a twelve-year-old rescue. At this distance, he could not run nor could he hide from his former church secretary and personal Genghis Kahn. He zipped his jacket, turned up the collar, armored himself. He could tell by Gus's bark that his dog was not into this encounter; Gus had met Snickers on other occasions and was unimpressed.",
      "'Why don't you get another leash?' she yelled over the barking.",
      "'This leash is fine,' he yelled back.",
      "'Seems like it would remind you of you know who.'",
      "She had seldom called his former companion by name.",
      "'I like being reminded of Barnabas!' he shouted into the din.",
      "Snickers retreated behind his owner, growling, as Gus took leeway to sniff Emma's shoes. Black. Sturdy. Size ten. Triple A. She was proud of the triple A. As her former priest and so-called boss, he knew almost everything about this woman whose desk had sat less than three feet from his own. He had to hand it to her \u2013 Emma Newland could, in a heartbeat, make three feet feel like three inches.",
      "She gave him the eye, as if she'd caught him being naughty in some inconceivable way. 'What brings you out so early?'",
      "'Gus!' he said.",
      "Up ahead, the first squirrel of the morning. And away they went at a trot.",
      "He and Gus were blowing across the parking lot at Mitford School when he met Grace Murphy, speed-walking toward the school's front entrance. Blond hair in braids, bifocals firmly in place, a wide-open smile displaying a hatchwork of braces on wayward teeth. Grace was one of his favorite people.",
      "'Good morning, Father! And good morning, Gusarino.' She stooped, girded by a backpack of considerable size, to give his happy dog a head scratch.",
      "'We're glad to see you out brightening up the world,' he said.",
      "'I'm reading to our English class this morning. I'm sort of nervous!'",
      "'What are you reading?'",
      "'Willa Cather On Writing.'",
      "'Willa Cather? Remind me what grade you're in?'",
      "'Fifth because I skipped third,' she said. 'Next week, we'll be reading from Eudora Welty's book on writing. I'm co-teaching a whole American Literature unit with Miss Phillips. Got to go, Father! Bye, Gussie! Have a great day!'",
      "'The Lord be with you!' he called after her.",
      "'And also with you!' she called back. Grace was an acolyte at Lord's Chapel, wise in the ways of liturgical response.",
      "He felt the smile on his face, the way it softened his skin that was busy drinking clean mountain air.",
      "Two squirrels later, he was back in the kitchen, staring at The List.",
      "He was a dash fatigued from their walk. Supplying St. Mark's in Holding had been a mixed blessing. Full priestly duties June through October, combined with driving up and down the mountain, had been a stretch. In the five months of priesting a troubled parish, he had counted heavily on the prayer that never fails.",
      "Back to business.",
      "His mother had been the Christmas-list maker of all time \u2013 everything inscribed in a stenographer's notebook by July seventh, when she closed her gardens to the public. She set at once to the task of making pin cushions, pillowcases, embroidered dresser scarves, the occasional sweater or baby blanket, and stacks of tea towels and aprons from printed flour sacks.",
      "'Th' woman is an industry,' said his grandfather.",
      "She also used flour sacks to make his boxers for her mortified son. He could depend on the sight of them under the tree \u2013 a starched four-pack wrapped in white tissue and adorned with a holly sprig.",
      "He remembered hiding like a common thief when exchanging his britches for running shorts in the school locker room. He had nonetheless been spied in this covert maneuver, and the shamings were a memory he detested. He was fourteen when he finally wrangled store-bought from his mother, the family exchequer.",

    "summary": "Steve Cropper co-wrote several classics, including \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay,\" \"Green Onions\" and \"In the Midnight Hour.\"",
    "story": [
      "Steve Cropper, the lean, soulful guitarist and songwriter who helped anchor the celebrated Memphis backing band Booker T. and the M.G.'s at Stax Records and co-wrote the classics \"Green Onions,\" \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\" and \"In the Midnight Hour,\" has died. He was 84.",
      "Pat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, confirmed Cropper's death to CBS News. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately known. Longtime associate Eddie Gore told The Associated Press he was with Cropper on Tuesday at a rehabilitation facility in Nashville, where Cropper had been after a recent fall. Cropper had been working on new music when Gore visited, he said.",
      "\"He's such a good human,\" Gore said. \"We were blessed to have him, for sure.\"",
      "\"Steve was a beloved musician, songwriter, and producer whose extraordinary talent touched the lives of millions worldwide,\" Cropper's family said in a statement released through the foundation, describing his \"influence on American music is immeasurable.\"",
      "\"Every note he played, every song he wrote, and every artist he inspired ensure that his spirit and artistry will continue to move people for generations to come,\" the family wrote.",
      "The guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. At a time when it was common for White musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare White artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.",
      "Cropper was celebrated, respected by fellow guitarists",
      "Cropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"",
      "In a 2020 interview with AP, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.",
      "\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.",
      "\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.",
      "Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.",
      "Cropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"",
      "Satellite was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, they were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\" and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others.",
      "Cropper co-wrote \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" weeks before Redding's death",
      "In a 2017 interview with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Cropper recounted playing guitar behind Redding at the Monterey Pop Festival in a legendary 1967 performance that helped put Redding on the map.",
      "\"We had no idea what the reaction was gonna be. And it was unbelievable,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "In late November of 1967, Cropper said Redding brought him a song the now-legendary singer had started writing on a houseboat overlooking San Francisco Bay that would become \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.\"",
      "\"That afternoon, it was done,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We went and cut it the next day. I think there's three takes of it.\"",
      "A few weeks later, on Dec. 10, 1967, Redding died in a small plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin, at the age of 26.",
      "\"And I said, 'I just lost my best friend,'\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Cropper returned to the studio to put the finishing touches on the song, and \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" released in January 1968, became the first posthumous No. 1 record on the Billboard charts. It won Redding and Cropper the Grammy for Best R&B song, with Redding also winning Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. broke barriers",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. was a racially integrated band, a rarity in its day. It was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett. Jones, who is the only surviving member of the band, and Jackson are Black. Dunn and Cropper are white.",
      "\"When you walked in the door at Stax, there was absolutely no color,\" Cropper said in the AP interview. \"We were all there for the same reason \u2014 to get a hit record.\"",
      "In the mid-1960s, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler brought Pickett to work with the Stax musicians. During a 2015 gathering with the National Music Publishers Association, Cropper acknowledged he had never heard of Pickett before working with him. He found some gospel recordings by Pickett, was taken by the line \"I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour\" and with a slight change helped write a secular standard.",
      "\"The man up there has been forgiving me for this ever since!\" he said.",
      "Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T. and the M.G.'s. That year, Cropper, Dunn and Jones played in an all-star tribute at Madison Square Garden to Bob Dylan. Al Jackson died in 1975, Dunn in 2012.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine ranked Cropper 39th on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list, calling him \"the secret ingredient in some of the greatest rock and soul songs.\"",
      "Cropper was in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\" and its follow-up, \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" portraying \"The Colonel\" in the Blues Brothers band. In real life, he toured with them.",
      "He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005, and two years later received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "Cropper continued recording into his later years, including 2024's \"Friendlytown,\" which was nominated for a Grammy. Earlier this year, Cropper received the Tennessee Governor's Arts Award, the state's highest honor in the arts.",
      "He is survived by his wife and four children.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avatar-fire-and-ash-director-james-cameron-on-generative-ai-thats-horrifying-to-me/",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:44:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Avatar\" director, who uses performance capture to help create fantasy characters, has consistently raised the level of movie visual effects. But James Cameron believes using artificial intelligence to create a character and performance without an actor is \"horrifying.\"",
    "story": [
      "Much of what we see from the Earth-like moon of Pandora, the fantastical setting for the \"Avatar\" franchise, comes from a soundstage in Los Angeles, where scenes from the second and third movies were filmed. \"We had to build an ocean,\" director James Cameron said. \"We could make a two-meter swell. We could make a wave crash up on a shoreline if we built the shoreline.\"",
      "Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Salda\u00f1a  and other actors shot their underwater scenes in the nearly 250,000-gallon tank. Digital artists then took those shots, called performance captures, as a template to render the final versions of the characters we see on screen.",
      "\"So, performance capture, we use a whole bunch of cameras to capture the body performance of the actor,\" Cameron explained. \"And we use a single camera (or now we use actually two) to video their face. They're in a close-up 100% of the time. But there's a beautiful thing about being in a close-up 100% of the time. It's very much like theater rehearsal.\"",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is the third film in the series. It tells the story of the indigenous Na'vis' fight to defend their paradise from colonizing humans.",
      "Cameron created these stories and this world. He's always been a dreamer, even as a kid in rural Canada. \"I lived in a world of my imagination \u2013 it was comic books, it was science fiction. I read a lot. There were movies, TV shows,\" he said. \"I mean, I had a pretty fertile imagination.\"",
      "Cameron moved to Los Angeles with his parents as a teen. He briefly attended community college, where studies included marine biology, before dropping out and picking up odd jobs, including truck driving.",
      "So, how did he go from blue collar to Hollywood? \"Watching 'Star Wars,'\" he said. \"I used to put my headphones on and listen to fast electronic music and imagine space battles, hyperkinetic space battles with all kinds of maneuvers and energy weapons, and people going through debris fields and all that. If the things I'm seeing in my mind can be the same things that are in a movie that's the number one movie in movie history, then I've got a salable imagination.\"",
      "He returned to school, although not in an official capacity. \"I started to study visual effects, and the way I did it was, I didn't have the money to go to USC or anything like that. So what I used to do is, I'd go down to USC, I'd go bury myself on a Saturday, when I wasn't driving a truck, in the stacks. And I'd read everything I could find on optical printing and front-screen projection and, you know, sodium process traveling mattes. All self-taught. I'd Xerox all these scholarly papers, put them all in binders. And I had this shelf full of black binders that had essentially a graduate course in visual effects and cinematography.\"",
      "He found jobs in visual effects departments and production design, rising through the ranks quickly due to his technical knowledge.",
      "Then, in the early 1980s, Cameron, inspired by a literal dream about a robot exoskeleton, co-wrote and directed \"The Terminator.\" The movie put him on the map, and proved he could turn his imagination into reality.",
      "But CGI wasn't available at the time; the effects were done largely through puppeteering. \"We just figured out how to do it all practically,\" Cameron said.",
      "He showed us around his private museum in Los Angeles, full of movie props from his films, including \"Aliens,\" where puppeteers brought Sigourney Weaver's powerlifter - and the Alien Queen \u2013 to life. Of the Alien Queen, Cameron said, \"Her head had, I think, seven or eight different axes of movement that were controlled by cables that went basically out her butt. And we had to hide all that stuff, so there was a lotta steam and smoke and backlight and things like that.\"",
      "Cameron's first use of CGI came with the science fiction movie \"The Abyss,\" It was also his first cinematic foray into another one of his fascinations: the deep sea. His second venture into an oceanic film? \"Titanic.\" It became the then-highest-grossing movie of all time. Cameron took home three Oscars himself.",
      "But the film itself was never the priority for Cameron: He said he wrote the script in order to explore the wreck of the Titanic. \"It was a little bit of a means to an end, you know?\" he said. \"I thought, 'I can just go do this. All right, I need a story. Okay, 'Romeo and Juliet.' You know, young, doomed love on the Titanic.' Boom! Like, instantaneous.\"",
      "He found a way to use Hollywood to invest in his passion for scientific exploration. \"Yeah, exactly,\" he said. \"And then I had so much fun on my expedition that was to shoot Titanic for the movie, that I basically took an eight-year hiatus from Hollywood, an eight-year sabbatical. And I did subsequently six more expeditions for a total of seven, before I started 'Avatar.'\"",
      "Cameron wrote the treatment for \"Avatar\" before \"Titanic,\" but it wasn't until 2005 that he thought the current technology could support his vision. And even then, he wasn't sure the business of Hollywood would go along. \"For years, there was this sense that, 'Oh, they're doing something strange with computers and they're replacing actors,' when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we're doing, it's a celebration of the actor-director moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character,\" he continued. \"They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"",
      "Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" opens next months.",
      "So, how does he feel a few weeks from the premiere? \"Nervous!\" he laughed. \"Are you kidding? Always. Always.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Cameron is still undaunted, and enamored by the unknown. \"I'm attracted, in case you haven't noticed, by things I don't know how to do,\" he said. \"Because you grow and you learn. If I'm still making movies when I got an oxygen tube up my nose and I'm 87 or whatever, should I be that lucky, I want to still be doing things I don't know how to do.\"",

    "summary": "The heavy metal band has not only changed lives with their music; they've also changed lives with their philanthropy \u2013 from donations to food banks and disaster relief, to their charity, All Within My Hands, which has donated to workforce education and other critical services.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen DeBerry is a newly-minted commercial delivery driver in Baltimore, Maryland. She says having this new job has completely changed her life. \"It feels awesome,\" she said. \"You know, I take care of my daughter, and I also take care of my mother.\"",
      "The commercial driver's license, like the type DeBerry got at the Community College of Baltimore County, can cost up to $7,500, money she didn't have \u2013 which is where four kind of unlikely guys from the Bay Area stepped in.",
      "Yes, we are talking about the guys from the band Metallica, one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, with more than 180 million records sold. \"I mean, to be honest, I didn't know when I first signed up that it was through Metallica; they just called it a scholarship,\" DeBerry said.",
      "A Metallica Scholarship, to be precise, part of the more than $10 million the band's charity All Within My Hands has donated to workforce education, mostly in the form of grants through trade schools and community colleges.",
      "\"Not everyone is built for college, and not everyone needs college,\" said Metallica lead singer James Hetfield. And he should know; he himself is the son of a truck driver, something he's hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"It was very evident during COVID, you know, when we weren't able to go out and do our thing,\" said Hetfield. \"But the plumber, the electrician, the truck driver, the people that needed to help keep America running were there. And thank God for them. You know, my thought is that the next millionaires will be the tradesmen.\"",
      "\"We all came from, I mean, pretty humble beginnings,\" said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, who worked in construction before he became a professional musician. \"At a certain point you realize, like, hey, you know, we're selling tickets, we're doing well, the ship's not sinking. What can we do to make people's lives better?\"",
      "The band's philanthropy actually began with the simple question of what to do with their leftover food backstage at the sports arenas and stadiums they'd been playing. They started donating it to local food banks; then, they starting donating sizable checks to those food banks as well, which turned into disaster relief.",
      "\"It was a bit profound for us because one of the first things that happened was in, maybe 2017, we had the Northern California fires that affected so many people in the Bay Area,\" said guitarist Kirk Hammett. When disaster struck in the band's backyard, that's when he says it hit home: \"And we were able to, like, jump in and, like, really help people right off the bat. And there's been other instances where there's been earthquakes, you know, disasters, people in need of food and medicine. And we've been able to step up and send money, and not just a pittance, but like enough money that makes a difference to, you know, a good group of people who need it.\"",
      "But actually talking about their charity work publicly? That didn't come as easily, says drummer Lars Ulrich. \"We had never screamed from the rooftops about it,\" he said. \"I think instinctively you just want to help. I mean, we all depend on each other \u2013 you know, if you really want to break it down, then you go, humans are herd animals and really thrive, you know, the flock does better when everybody is doing well.\"",
      "Now, if all this doesn't sound very Metallica-like, well, in a way neither does the annual fundraiser concert that they've been putting on in Los Angeles. Last year it raised $3.5 million and brought in some big Metallica admirers, like Aquaman himself Jason Momoa. \"They've kind of been the soundtrack of my life, man. I've kind of discovered them probably when I was ten years old. And I think these are your heroes. These are my heroes.\"",
      "It might come as a surprise to some that a band with songs like \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" spends so much time thinking about how to better other people's lives. But for Hetfield, it's a thought process that comes with age.",
      "\"It seems clearer that we have a purpose,\" he said. \"And that purpose is to bring joy to people on this planet, and absolutely still blows my mind that there's three generations out there, you know, rocking out to 'Master of Puppets.' Like, really? You like this song? Okay! That was written when I was 22 years old, and I was pissed off. But beyond what we've done in the music thing, as you get older, you start to see the world in a different light, you know? My philosophy is, you're climbing to the next layer of the high rise. And the older you get, the better the view is of the world, and what you get to see, and where you can be of service. And this is certainly one of them.\"",
      "Up until now, Hetfield had never actually met a Metallica scholar, but that changed backstage before a show in Landover, Maryland, when a very appreciative Carmen DeBerry stopped by. \"I really think that your scholarship, me telling them about your scholarship, is what got me the job,\" she told Hetfield. \"Because once I told them that I got the Metallica scholarship, they were like, Whaaaaat? I got an entrance, and they took a chance with me. And I appreciate it.\"",
      "\"Right on!\" Hetfield replied.",
      "I asked, \"You're about to go out and play to thousands and thousands of people, and yet you just had a moment of getting to talk to somebody whose life has been significantly changed from All Within My Hands' charity work. What's that feel like?\"",
      "Hetfield replied, \"It is so amazing. We get to go make some people smile out there, deliver the goods by playing songs that saved us in our lives. And then to create a foundation that's giving back to, you know, the blue collar America? We get to go from thousands that are making big noise, that we know we're impacting, but to get a one-on-one, you know, heart-to-heart with somebody whose life you've changed, it changes mine.\"",

So, every time I'd say it's a challenge, it's really hard, and I look back and I'm like, I wouldn't want to do that again! But when I'm in it, it's more than a challenge; it's a new life. I'm being born into something \u2013 a new version of myself.\"",
      "Her commitment is right there on the screen in two movies out next month: the psychological thriller \"The Housemaid,\" co-starring Sydney Sweeney; and the dramatic musical \"The Testament of Ann Lee.\"",
      "In that 18th century story, Seyfried plays Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers, a religious sect that embraced equality and chastity, even inside of marriage.",
      "\"Her conviction was everything,\" Seyfried said of Lee. \"The coolest thing about her is that she created a utopia. The idea that we're better off working together as equals, it still rings true to this day. Like, if you take away power and control of each other, there's nothing we can't do.\"",
      "The cast received a long standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, while the role has made Seyfried an Oscar contender.",
      "\"It's like, I worked my ass off in this specific experience, and I worked my ass off throughout my career, and I've stayed true to who I am,\" she said. \"I've definitely changed, and evolved, and become a better person. Do I still make mistakes? Uh-huh, yeah. Do I still make bad choices? Yeah! But I'm human, and I'm, like, doing the best I can. And I'm nice. And I'm f****** nice!\" she laughed. \"'Cause there's no other reason not to be.\"",
      "I can testify, she is \u2026 nice! And refreshingly honest. Raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Seyfried studied acting and music as a kid, did some modeling, too. In high school, she was a regular on the soap opera \"All My Children.\" She was on the show for ten months.",
      "Why'd she leave it? \"Why did I leave? Why did Megan McTavish write me off? I don't know, ask her!\" she laughed.",
      "Getting fired, even at 17, hurt. She figured acting was over, so she enrolled at New York's Fordham University, sort of. \"I, like, took the elevator up, and then I stood there, looked at the elevators, and then I took the escalator down, and then I went home. That was my time at Fordham,\" she laughed.",
      "Immediately after \"college,\" Seyfried landed an audition for \"Mean Girls,\" her first big break. \"Mamma Mia!\" was her second. It led to a sequel, 2018's \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\" \u2026 and maybe a trilogy? Asked if there was going to be a third one, she replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"",
      "\"Do we know anything about the story?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I think if we all decided we'll do it for free, they'll be like, 'Cool. Let's do it tomorrow,'\" she replied. \"I know Judy Craymer, who created it, is working furiously on a script. I just assume it'll happen exactly ten years from when we shot the last one, which was '17. So, we'll shoot it in 2027, out in 2028. Every ten years! I just don't know how they get Meryl back.\"",
      "Well, that is the tricky part, as her character is (spoiler) dead. Evil twin? \"There it is!\" Seyfried smiled.",
      "Some character traits can stay with Seyfried, like the voice of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder convicted of fraud in \"The Dropout\" (2022). The role won Seyfried an Emmy.",
      "Seyfried is candid about everything, including battling serious anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, obstacles she believes help her as an actor. \u00a0\"All the things that I have, I've been diagnosed with, I've been able to channel them in the right ways and take the right medication to use it to my advantage,\" she said, \"and to, like, shut it up when it's no longer helpful, for the most part. And that has helped me. Self-loathing, self-judgment, all that, at times helped me keep my s*** together.\"",
      "Seyfried, who turns 40 this week, is married to actor Thomas Sadowski. They have two children. Her daughter was close by during our conversation, as was a guitar. It's one of many instruments Seyfried  plays.",
      "She was looking right at her daughter as she sang.",
      "Seeing her in own house, this farm upstate, surrounded by family and animals, reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
      "\"It's my world now,\" she said. \"Like, I've been in it for 25 years or whatever. And I, like, totally feel at home in it. And people know me well enough, I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I'm nice to people. I'm not trying to cover up any scandals \u2013 yet! Wait! \u2013 and I'm not trying to, you know, hide or, like, run away from any bad press. So it's like, I've made it easy for myself. So far!\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 19:55:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Netflix on Friday said it will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix on Friday said it is buying Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, merging the biggest streaming service with a storied studio that has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.",
      "In a statement, Netflix said the deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

      "In a letter to Waymo dated Dec. 3, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it will investigate the performance of the autonomous vehicles and their ability to follow traffic safety laws.\u00a0Reuters\u00a0first reported the news.",
      "The Austin Independent School District told CBS News it is now aware of 20 incidents this school year in which a Waymo vehicle illegally passed a school bus. All 50 U.S. states have laws requiring vehicles to halt for a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and a deployed stop-arm signal,\u00a0according to the NHTSA.",
      "Waymo said it identified the software issue that contributed to the school bus incidents and that it implemented updates by Nov. 17, which it said improved its vehicles' performance. The company is also planning to issue a voluntary software recall with NHTSA next week, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, chief safety officer at Waymo, told CBS News late Friday.",
      "\"We will continue analyzing our vehicles' performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement,\" said Pe\u00f1a.",
      "Local officials in Austin say they remain concerned about road safety.",
      "\"As of Dec. 1, 2025, Waymo received its 20th citation since the beginning of the school year,\" JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the Austin Independent School District, told CBS News. \"This is after the company said it had fixed the issue through software updates that were implemented on Nov. 17.\"",
      "In a Nov. 20\u00a0letter\u00a0to Waymo, the school district called on the robotaxi company to cease operations within the school district during the hours when students are loading and unloading from school buses until software updates are completed and Waymo can guarantee its vehicles will comply with the law.",
      "Maldonado said the company \"refused to cease operations\" during the hours the school district had requested.",
      "In response to a request for comment about the NHTSA probe, Waymo pointed to its overall safety record.",
      "\"Safety is our top priority, and the data shows we are improving road safety in the communities in which we operate, achieving a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians,\" a Waymo spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Waymo did not comment on its response to the Austin school district's request to suspend service when students are getting on and off buses.",
      "In October, NHTSA launched a probe into the company after an incident in Atlanta, Georgia, in which a Waymo vehicle drove around a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and its stop arm deployed.",
      "While maneuvering around the bus, NHTSA said the vehicle passed the bus' stop arm and a safety device that swings out from the bus close to where students were disembarking. At the time of the incident, no safety operator was present in the self-driving vehicle, according to the NHTSA.",
      "Atlanta Public Schools, a school district, told CBS Atlanta they are aware of six cases where Waymo cars illegally passed stopped school buses.",

      "Angel Escobedo started looking for work a year and a half ago, even before completing his college degree at Saint Xavier University in Chicago. Now, with less than a week to go before graduation and having applied to more than 150 jobs, he's still searching.",
      "Escobedo's predicament illustrates the challenges that many young Americans, even those with impressive academic records, are having entering the nation's workforce amid a broad decline in job listings and as they compete with more experienced people.",
      "\"They're sort of missing out on the ability to jump into the labor market,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. \"It's not a new phenomenon, but it is a concerning phenomenon.\"",
      "For young adults eager to start their careers, the obstacles can seem daunting. Escobedo, 22, has had multiple professional internships during his college career and also completed a management training program at Harvard Business School. The Illinois resident, who is seeking a job in finance or business operations, said he has found the job search process \"very discouraging,\" noting that he's open to just about any kind of employment.",
      "Gen Z job applicants, like other workers, are also having to navigate a quickly changing job-hunting landscape in which employers increasingly use AI and self-recorded video interviews to screen candidates. Job seekers told CBS News that while it's easy to apply for work, finding ways to stand out is hard, while the new tech adds a new layer of complexity.",
      "Gorick Ng, a Harvard career adviser and University of California, Berkeley, faculty member, said the stakes for Gen Z are high. If they can't get the right experience early on, they could struggle to catch up professionally and financially.",
      "\"If the pool of entry-level opportunities continues to dry up, then it's going to be ever more challenging for this generation to show certain brand names, certain job titles and certain bullet points on their resumes, which is only going to make that next job more challenging to get,\" he said.",
      "Slowdown in hiring",
      "Getting your foot in the door has always been tougher for young workers, and current labor market conditions aren't making it any easier. The overall hiring rate, which has been declining since 2022, has fallen to just over 3%, below its historical average, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Hiring is muted due to uncertainty about the U.S. economy, including the government policy environment and tariffs, Gould told CBS News. \"There's this sort of sitting tight for employers and for workers right now, not wanting to make any sudden moves because of the uncertainty,\" she said.",
      "The nation's overall unemployment rate in September was 4.4% \u2014 less than half the 9.2% rate for 20- to 24-year-olds, according to government labor figures.",
      "Even when early-career employees succeed in landing a coveted position, they may face barriers climbing the ladder. That's because, with more seasoned employees often staying put these days because of economic uncertainty and as employment turnover slows, Gen Zers have fewer opportunities to switch jobs \u2014 a common route to gaining more responsibilities and higher pay.",
      "\"Your salary is all about growing or negotiating leverage,\" Ng said. \"And so when you look for another position, one of the easiest ways to ask for more money is to have made more money in the past.\"",
      "Alan Gonzalez, a 23-year-old resident of Malden, Mass., said he'd be willing to take a lower-paying job in his field just to kick-start his career. Since graduating from UMass Boston in May, he has been working as a restaurant server while looking for a position in digital marketing.",
      "\"Despite having a lot of internship experience and real-world practical experience that I can apply, including my degree, it has still been very difficult to even get an interview opportunity,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Eager to exercise his creativity but without any job offers in hand, Gonzalez has also started his own clothing brand, HOJA Apparel, which he describes as a \"lifestyle streetwear meets streetwear hybrid\" focused on high-quality and design. He's working to grow his social media presence to promote the brand, with an official clothing drop planned for next year.",
      "\"Right now, the priority is experience,\" Gonzalez said.",
      "Some industries pose their own challenges when Gen Z job-hunters come knocking. For example, employers in fields such as accounting, engineering and technology typically have fewer job openings for junior employees than senior-level roles, according to data from career services firm Indeed.",
      "\"It has become progressively harder for almost anyone to secure jobs in those areas, and this is especially true for younger workers,\" Cory Stahle, senior economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email. \"Fewer opportunities also mean that entry-level workers are becoming more likely to compete against an increasing number of mid- or senior-level workers in the process as well.\"",
      "As of October, an average of around 30% of software development jobs listed on Indeed were for positions with senior titles, versus around 2% for roles with junior titles. Similar discrepancies exist for data analysis and tech positions.",
      "Many of the challenges of finding work are not unique to members of Gen Z, of course. Technology has long made it easier for people to submit a job application. But the latest technologies are also upping the competitive ante, according to Ng.",
      "\"AI and tech tools have made it easier to apply for internships,\" he said. \"But whenever something gets easier, the bar only gets higher, and the job application is really no different.\"",
      "Ng advises job candidates to get back to basics. That means trying to build relationships with potential employers, starting their job search early and making a concerted effort to get in front of a company's decision-makers.",
      "Escobedo said he's now putting an emphasis on old-school networking to get employers' attention. \"I've told my peers, the whole thing that it takes a village to raise a child, now it takes a village to get a college student a full-time role.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:56:46 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "This story has been updated with additional information from Invenergy.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 15:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Minimum wages are set to rise in 22 U.S. states and 66 cities and counties next year, even as the federal baseline wage remains at $7.25.",
    "story": [
      "Some workers will receive pay boosts next year as higher minimum wage regulations take effect in 22 states and 66 cities and counties across the U.S., a change that could help low-income households grappling with an\u00a0affordability crisis.",
      "On Jan. 1, 2026, the minimum wage is set to rise in 19 states and 49 cities and counties, for a total of 68 jurisdictions, according to a report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy organization for workers.",
      "Later in the year, an additional four states and 22 cities will boost their baseline wages, providing more relief to the lowest-paid U.S. workers, according to the group's analysis.",
      "Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the federal wage floor remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has been stuck since 2009. Given the rise in the cost of living in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have chosen to boost their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"Policies increasing the minimum wage have been a lifeline for underpaid workers who have been the most impacted by a growing affordability crisis,\" the NELP report states.",
      "Here's where minimum wages will rise in 2026:",
      "Jan. 1 minimum wage increases",
      "Beginning Jan. 1, workers in 60 jurisdictions will earn a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour. In three states and 40 localities, the minimum wage for some or all employers will reach or exceed $17 an hour.",
      "For example, in New Jersey, the wage floor for long-term care workers will rise to $18.92 an hour. New York City, Long Island and Westchester will all increase their baseline pay to $17 an hour.",
      "In some cases, minimum wage changes will be based on the size of the employer. For instance, large employers in Hayward, California \u2014 a city near San Francisco \u2014 will be required to pay workers a minimum of $17.79 an hour, although the figure for small establishments is $16.90.",
      "In Novato, California, another city in the Bay Area, the wage floor will increase according to employer size. For very large employers, or those with more than 100 workers, the minimum wage will rise to $17.73 an hour. Large employers, or those with 26 to 99 employees, will see a baseline pay of $17.46. Small employers, or those with 25 or fewer workers, will have a minimum wage of $16.90.",
      "Cost-of-living adjustments, raises designed to help workers' pay keep up with inflation, are driving minimum wage increases in 13 states and 44 cities and counties across the U.S., according to the NELP report.",
      "\"In the face of federal inaction, these raises are indexed to inflation, so they match the cost of living,\" NELP researcher Tsedeye Gebreselassie told CBS News.",
      "She noted that several increases have been driven by worker-led organizing, kicked off by the Fight for $15, a national movement for better pay and working conditions, which began in 2012.",
      "Some localities continue to have a $7.25 minimum wage. Many of them are in southern U.S. states.",
      "\"The contrast between states and cities that are raising wages every year and those that are stuck at $7.25 is really jarring,\" Gebreselassie said. \"On the one hand, the lack of affordability is about things costing too much, but on the other hand, it means people are not earning enough money to buy things.\"",
      "She added, \"There is a lot of talk about the former, but we need to make sure we are not losing sight of the fact that workers' wages need to go up.\"",

    "summary": "As the White House tries to curb Moscow's energy income, Vladimir Putin enjoys a warm welcome in India, and promises an \"uninterrupted supply\" of Russian fuel.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday at an annual summit and agreed to diversify mutual economic ties, as the United States presses India to revise its decades-old partnership with Russia.",
      "The 23rd Russia-India Summit comes at a pivotal moment as the U.S. pushes for a Ukraine peace deal while seeking global cooperation. It will test New Delhi's efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the nearly four-year war in Ukraine grinds on.",
      "Putin was received by Modi at an airport in New Delhi on Thursday. The Indian leader gave Putin a bear hug and a tight handshake with the gusto of an old friend.",
      "After the talks, Putin and Modi announced that India and Russia have finalized an economic cooperation program until 2030, which will help diversify mutual businesses to boost annual trade to $100 billion by 2030. They also emphasized strong energy ties.",
      "Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $68.7 billion in the last fiscal year ended March. The trade is heavily skewed in favor of Russia with deep deficits for India, which it is looking to bridge by pushing exports.",
      "\"To achieve this significant goal, a program for the development of Russian-Indian economic cooperation until 2030 has been agreed upon,\" Putin said. He said work is underway on an agreement for India to establish a free trade zone with the Eurasian Economic Union, a Moscow-dominated economic grouping of several ex-Soviet nations, adding that it could help increase trade.",
      "\"Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources and everything necessary for the development of India's energy sector,\" Putin said. \"We are ready to continue ensuring the uninterrupted supply of fuel for the rapidly growing Indian economy.\"",
      "Before the summit talks, the Russian leader said the two countries \"have a very trusting relationship when it comes to military-technical cooperation.\"",
      "Modi, for his part, said after the talks that the two countries will work toward early conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. He also announced that India will soon start issuing free electronic visas for Russian tourists and groups visiting the country.",
      "The Indian leader said energy security has long anchored India-Russia ties, with civil nuclear cooperation spanning decades. He added that such cooperation will continue, alongside collaboration in clean energy, shipbuilding, fertilizers and labor mobility.",
      "While India has historically maintained deep ties with Russia, critics say Putin's visit could strain relations with the European Union and the United States and might jeopardize negotiations for major trade agreements with both that are seen as critical for India's exports.",
      "President Trump raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50% in August, citing New Delhi's discounted Russian oil. India has been the second biggest importer of Russian crude after China.",
      "India's \"strategic tightrope walk\" between Russia and the West",
      "The U.S. says purchases of Russian oil help finance Moscow's war machine. In October, the U.S. sanctioned two of Moscow's biggest oil producers to force countries like India to cut down on imports. Indian officials have said New Delhi has always abided by international sanctions and would do so in the case of Russia oil purchases as well.",
      "The sanctions announced in October targeting Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft were the first direct actions against Russia by the U.S. Treasury since Mr. Trump took office for his second term. The Treasury said about a month later that they were having the desired impact, with nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil coming forward to say they would pause purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December.",
      "India and the U.S. set a target for the first tranche of a trade deal by the fall, but the deal hasn't come through yet amid strains in relations. The Trump administration has for months tied the imposition of steep tariffs on Indian imports directly to the country's ongoing purchases of Russian energy.",

      "How Russia works around sanctions designed to cripple its war-time economy",
      "India is also in the final stages of talks on a trade agreement with the EU, which sees Russia's war in Ukraine as a major threat.",
      "Putin's India visit, \"given the timing and geopolitical context, underscores New Delhi's strategic tightrope walk between the West and the rest, chiefly Russia,\" said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group.",
      "Donthi said India's tilt toward Russia dates back to the Cold War and persists despite its official nonaligned position. \"The significant change now is its desire to be a strategic partner with the U.S. at the same time, which will be a diplomatic challenge,\" he added.",
      "Indian officials earlier said that Modi in the meeting with Putin would push for faster delivery of two further Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. It has already received three under a 2018 deal worth about $5.4 billion. The delay has been tied to supply chain disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine.",
      "The two sides signed a pact in February to improve military cooperation, exercises, port calls, disaster relief assistance and logistics support. Moscow's State Duma ratified the same ahead of Putin's India visit.",
      "India is also expecting to upgrade its Russian-made Su-30MKI fighter jets and accelerate deliveries of critical military hardware.",
      "India is keen to increase exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture and textiles to Russia and is seeking the removal of non-tariff barriers. New Delhi is also seeking long-term supplies of fertilizers from Moscow.",
      "Another key area where the two countries hope to finalize an agreement is the safety and regulation of migration of Indian skilled workers to Russia.",
      "Putin last visited India in 2021. Modi was in Moscow last year, and the two leaders briefly met in September in China during a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:27:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Rents in the 50 largest cities have surged by hundreds of dollars per month over the last five years, a LendingTree analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "If buying a home today is\u00a0financially out of reach\u00a0for many Americans, affording the rent may also seem like an increasingly tall order.",
      "In the 50 largest U.S. cities, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment climbed an average of $457 per month, or 41%, to $1,578\u00a0between 2020 and 2025, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0from loan marketplace LendingTree. Two-bedroom rents have surged an average of $505, or 37%, to roughly $1,858 per month over the same period.",
      "Since 2019, rents nationally have risen\u00a01.5 times faster than wages on average, according to a 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from online real estate brokers Zillow and StreetEasy.",
      "\"If your income is rising at the same time your rent is, maybe that extra expense is no big deal,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in the report. \"However, so many Americans' financial wiggle room is tiny, even in the best of times, so having to carve out hundreds of extra dollars to pay rent each month can be a big deal.\"",
      "Several factors explain why rents have surged, said Rob Bhatt, a consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. Perhaps most importantly, during the pandemic legions of newly remote workers moved to new markets, driving up rent\u00a0and housing prices.",
      "\"All the things that we saw during the pandemic have created stresses on the system, including stresses in these markets that traditionally haven't been renters' markets, and so it's going to take a little bit of time to adjust,\" he told CBS News.",
      "High home prices and rising mortgage rates, which have kept a lid on the number of homes coming to market, have also left more renters competing for a limited stock of affordable housing. Rents are projected to ease nationally next year, but only by 1%, according to a recent study from Realtor.com.",
      "Where have rents risen the most?",
      "New York, San Diego and Miami have seen the largest monthly rental increases for both one-bedroom units \u2014 which rose $854, $817 and $764 in the three cities, respectively, since 2020 \u2014 and two-bedroom units, which have jumped $857, $877 and $885, respectively, over the last five years.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 cities where one-bedroom rents have risen the most over the last five years, according to LendingTree (see chart below for a listing of the change in rents for the top 50 cities):",

      "Atlanta",

      "Boston",
      "Phoenix",
      "In New York and San Diego, the spike in rents is attributable mostly to the demand for housing exceeding supply, according to LendingTree. Renters in those metro areas face limited inventory and plenty of competition.",
      "LendingTree attributed the surge in rental prices in Miami to the local population boom, noting that strong domestic and international migration to the area has driven up demand.",
      "One high-priced city where rent increases have cooled is San Francisco. The cost of a one-bedroom unit in the city rose $54 a month, to an average of $2,977, over the last five years, while two-bedrooms rose $51 to $3,604, LendingTree found.",
      "Other cities where rents are growing more slowly are Birmingham, Ala.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; San Antonio, Texas; and St. Louis, Mo.",
      "LendingTree's findings are based on an analysis of fair-market rents (FMR) from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The federal agency defines such rents as \"estimates of 40th percentile gross rents for standard-quality units within a metropolitan area or nonmetropolitan county.\" The firm's figures exclude rents for public housing and for units built within the past two years.",

      "Employers have cut more than 1.1 million jobs through November, the most since 2020, when companies laid off 2.2 million workers as the pandemic was slamming the U.S. economy, according to a new report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "The layoffs represent a 54% increase from the same period a year earlier, when employers cut 761,358 jobs, according to the firm. It's also only the sixth time since 1993 that job cuts during the first 11 months of the year have risen above 1.1 million.",
      "Here's what is driving the increase in 2025 layoffs, according to Challenger.",
      "Tech is driving the surge in job cuts",
      "The technology sector is leading this year's job cuts, laying off 153,536 workers through November, according to Challenger. That's a 17% jump from the 130,701 layoffs tech firms announced by the same point in 2024.",
      "Amazon is among the tech firms that have announced substantial workforce reductions. In October, the company said it would cut 14,000 jobs as it leans on AI tools to boost efficiency.",
      "The retail sector reduced its workforce by 91,954 jobs through November, as consumers grapple with higher prices and pull back on spending on discretionary goods. While retailers typically ramp up hiring toward year-end to accommodate holiday shoppers, 2025 is shaping up to be the\u00a0weakest in 15 years for seasonal work.",

DOGE, a cost-cutting effort, reduced both funding and employment at some federal agencies earlier this year.",
      "DOGE accounted for another 21,000 indirect job cuts at private and nonprofit entities that lost federal funding.",

      "Artificial intelligence advances accounted for 54,700 job cuts, while tariffs were cited for nearly 8,000. President Trump's levies on trade partners have raised costs for companies, prompting some to trim spending elsewhere, including on labor.",
      "Small businesses, which operate on thin margins, say the tariffs have hit them especially hard. New\u00a0data from payroll firm ADP\u00a0shows that private-sector employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, driven largely by firms with fewer than 50 employees. These smaller employers have borne the brunt of rising costs and ongoing policy uncertainty.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Zillow, another online real estate marketplace, also expects the housing market will ease for homebuyers as inventory grows and mortgage rates tick down. The company projects existing home sales will rise to nearly 4.3 million next year, up 4.3% from its projected total for 2025. Mortgage rates are likely to hover just above 6%, according to Zillow \u2014 higher than in recent years, but modest by historical standards.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",
      "To make its projections,\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0examined inventory, new construction, price growth, wage and job growth, and unemployment across the 100 cities.",

    "story": [
      "Trump accounts are a new type of tax-deferred investment vehicle for U.S. children, created under President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill, which promises $1,000 seed contributions from the federal government for eligible kids.",

      "Who is eligible for a Trump account?",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",
      "Annual contribution limits to the accounts are indexed to inflation and will be adjusted after 2027, according to a notice from the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Can funds be withdrawn before a child turns 18?",
      "No. Families may not withdraw funds from a Trump account before a child turns 18, except for the following reasons:",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage\u00a0Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17\u00a0Distribution when the individual dies",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage",
      "Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17",
      "Distribution when the individual dies",
      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "The government's initial starter deposit is an appealing feature of Trump accounts, according to experts. Beyond the seed money, however, they offer fewer benefits than other savings plans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "\"A simpler approach would consolidate today's patchwork of savings accounts into universal savings accounts that are flexible, tax-neutral and easier for families to use,\" the policy research group added in a report.",
      "To save money for college, a 529 plan, which lets families sock away money for education expenses tax-free, could be a better alternative, investment experts said. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering account holders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-new-fuel-economy-standards-mpg-biden/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefska described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

      "The money will be given to most children ages 10 and younger who were born before the qualifying date of the Trump accounts, which were created earlier this year through the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Those accounts are designed to provide $1,000 to babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",

      "Dell, who is ranked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the world's 11th richest person with net worth of $148 billion, said he and his wife were inspired by the Invest America program, which is the formal name of the Trump accounts. The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",
      "Susan Dell added that the gift builds on the couple's previous philanthropic efforts to help children through their foundation. The pair announced the program on Giving Tuesday, an annual event where people are encouraged to make charitable contributions.",
      "\"When we heard about this, for us, this was a natural fit,\" Susan Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings.\" \"This was going to reach a lot of children and help them have a start at a really bright future.\"",
      "Dell Technologies \u2014 the company founded by Michael Dell, where he serves as CEO \u2014 said in June that it had pledged to match the Treasury Department's $1,000 contributions to the Trump Accounts. The Dell corporate match will be provided to every child born to its U.S.-based employees between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, the company said in an email to CBS News.",
      "\"Today's philanthropic gift from Michael and Susan Dell is separate from, and in addition to, our corporate commitment,\" Dell Technologies said. \"Together, these contributions provide children with meaningful financial opportunities and a transformative head start toward their futures.\"",

      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program, according to Invest America.",
      "Sign-ups are slated to begin on July 4, 2026, with parents and caregivers needed to activate the accounts. The Department of Treasury will seed the accounts with $1,000 per child, while parents, friends and others can also contribute up to $5,000 per year.",
      "Signing up will be easy, according to details released by the Trump adminstration on Tuesday. Parents or guardians will need to file an IRS Form 4547, a one-page document that asks for basic information such as a child's home address and Social Security number, to activate the account.",
      "The accounts are limited to investing in broad U.S. stock funds that track the overall market, such as a S&P 500 fund, don't use leverage and charge no more than 0.1% in annual fees. Parents can make elections for their children's accounts at trumpaccounts.gov.",

    "summary": "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is seeking to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",
      "Dan Savickas, the vice president of policy and government affairs at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, told lawmakers during the hearing that \"on average, members of both political parties outperformed the market.\"",
      "\"Each party's performance gets a boost when they control more branches of government,\" Savickas said. \"This only lends further credence to the public perception that congressional representatives are using their office for personal gain rather than public service.\"",
      "No member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the current law and no public records exist indicating that any officials have ever paid fines for disclosure errors, according to James R. Copland, a senior fellow at Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank.",
      "Luna called\u00a0last month's hearing \"for show,\" and expressed concern that watered-down legislation \"with no teeth\" could end up on the floor instead of the compromise bill.",

    "summary": "Flyers without Real IDs, passports or other accepted forms of identification will need to pay a $45 fee starting Feb. 1.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",
      "What's an acceptable form of ID?",
      "Travelers with Real IDs or other accepted forms of identification don't have to pay the $45 fee to travel. Here are some of the documents the TSA says can substitute for a Real-ID-compliant driver's license:",
      "State-issued Enhanced Driver's License (EDL) or Enhanced ID (EID)U.S. or foreign government-issued passportU.S. passport cardDHS trusted traveler cards ((Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)U.S. Department of Defense IDPermanent resident cardBorder crossing card",

      "The TSA's website has a\u00a0complete list of compliant types of IDs.",
      "Who has a Real ID?",
      "The TSA noted that more than 94% of passengers currently use Real IDs or other acceptable forms of identification.",
      "The TSA had previously proposed a rule that would charge travelers without a Real ID an $18 fee at security checkpoints, according to a\u00a0notice\u00a0published in the Federal Register earlier this month.",
      "The cost of getting a Real ID varies by state. New York, for example, has no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the regular cost of getting a driver's license or renewing it, but\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:08:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Personal finance is too complex for most people to navigate, two economists contend in a new book. Is there a better way to help people deal with money?",
    "story": [
      "Americans typically score poorly in financial literacy tests. Yet they're on their own when it comes to making major financial decisions, from funding their retirement to buying a home, two economists argue in a new book that critiques the personal finance system.",
      "Take the U.S. retirement system, which has shifted away from corporate-based pensions that guaranteed income in old age toward 401(k) plans, where workers must decide how to invest their savings.",
      "In theory, taking control of your investment decisions should be empowering, but the current U.S. retirement system \"appears too complex for many people to understand,\" write Harvard University economist John Campbell and Imperial College London economist Tarun Ramadorai in \"Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone,\" published by Princeton University Press.",
      "Despite some recent changes in how personal finance is practiced in the U.S., such as automatic enrollment in 401(k)s that were inspired by behavioral economist Richard Thaler's research about \"nudges\" \u2014 small changes that can steer people to make positive financial decisions \u2014 millions of Americans remain woefully unprepared to weather the financial strains of old age.",
      "Stronger medicine is needed, Campbell and Ramadorai say. Rather than a nudge, they call for a combination of regulatory and industry changes designed to overhaul the country's approach to personal finance \u2014 a broader shift they describe as a \"shove.\"",
      "\"We've learned that people make many mistakes, and particularly, sadly, less educated and poorer people tend to make worse mistakes,\" Campbell told CBS News.",
      "Their book proposes a \"starter kit\" of personal finance options, such as retirement accounts that automatically enroll people when they start their first job and stay with them throughout their careers, along with savings accounts that pay interest at the same rate and carry clear, transparent fees.",
      "CBS News spoke with Campbell and Ramdorai about their new book. It has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "CBS News: You write that most Americans are financially illiterate, according to one\u00a0basic assessment. Yet you say that introducing personal finance classes in high school isn't the solution. Why?",
      "Campbell: A simple way to put it is that you have a race between financial literacy and the complexity of the products people are offered, and the decisions they're asked to make. And complexity has been winning the race.",
      "Yes, young people in high school do have to make some big decisions \u2014 taking on student debt, going to college. They may also get a credit card, and then they have to manage their credit score. But there are a lot of other decisions they won't make until much later in life.",
      "It's as if we were trying to teach people to drive by just having the classroom component of driver's ed, without putting the kids behind the wheel.",
      "Ramadorai: All of us are also consumers in the personal finance system, and if you ask me what fraction of my daily time I spend thinking about my own personal finance situation, it's probably fairly small. But the financial sector is entirely focused \u2014 especially those on the personal finance side \u2014 on trying to get this right. So there's a sort of uneven competition between me, however educated I may be, and the financial sector, who is doing this on an industrial scale.",
      "For us to say, \"Oh, well, you know, if only you had taken the time and trouble to be educated, you wouldn't be in the situation you're in right now,\" that seems a bit glib. We're proposing not just putting all of the burden of responsibility on individuals.",
      "You advocate for \"shoves\" instead of \"nudges\" to ensure people are on the proper financial path. Can you elaborate?",
      "Ramadorai: We've seen lots of good examples of these nudges \u2014 for example, auto-enrollment into pension plans. That seems like it's a very well-functioning, effective policy until you start to look a little bit more closely at it. Research is starting to emerge that, in some cases, what happens is that the default contribution rate can actually either be too high or too low, depending on what kind of person you are.",
      "There's a kind of characterization or a caricature of academics as, \"All you want is, you just want the government to come in and fix everything.\" That's really not what we're about in this book.",
      "What we're trying to say is that we believe very strongly in the power of capitalism to produce products that are extremely high quality and are delivered at very low prices. But the energy of capitalism has been perverted.",
      "Campbell: We'd like to make personal finance shopping more like buying a painkiller when you have a headache. You know, you walk into the pharmacy, you go to the shelf. There's ibuprofen, there's Advil, there's the generic \u2014 it's all on the same shelf. The active ingredient is the same, the dosage is the same, and there's a little label on the shelf that shows you the price per unit.",
      "We think personal finance, unfortunately, is a long way away from that right now. It's more like the world of unregulated medicine 120 years ago, when people were selling legitimate medicines, but they were also selling snake oil, and it was very hard for individuals to tell the difference.",
      "You're suggesting that personal finance should be more tightly regulated. Critics of that idea might argue that this would chill innovation in personal finance. What's your view?",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0There are areas where even the most laissez-faire among us would agree that there's a role for government intervention. Think about civil aviation.",
      "Civil aviation transports very large numbers of people across vast distances at a relatively low cost, and what we don't necessarily want is for people to come in and innovate in that space in a way that introduces risks, because we're super averse to the fact that we don't want these things falling out of the sky.",
      "The other one, of course, is basic utilities. You want the lights to be on \u2014 electricity companies are regulated in a particular way, there's piping that goes to houses for running water. We think that there's a strong role for government to play in having regulation in those areas.",
      "Our argument is that there are vast areas of personal finance that are just as important as any of those basic utilities. It is the plumbing that makes our financial system work.",
      "Campbell: We instead propose a forward-looking, design-focused approach to regulation, where we ask the regulators to get very specific about what a basic financial product should look like. We call these \"starter kit products.\" They can offer a wide range of products. And the starter kit product should be designed so that it is simple, safe, cheap and easy.",
      "If you could redesign how personal finance works in the U.S. from the ground up, what would be the first feature you would build in?",
      "Campbell:\u00a0Number one, I would create a universal retirement account. I would give it a Roth structure that is open for people, automatically upon the date of first employment, and then you can carry it with you across all jobs that you have subsequently.",
      "That would fix the problem we have at the moment \u2014 we have this immense profusion of accounts, and as people change jobs, they very often end up with multiple 401(k)s. But at the same time, people who work for small businesses or who are self-employed \u2014 maybe they open an IRA, maybe they don't \u2014 but the contribution limits are much lower, and so we have an access problem.",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0Right now in the United States, there's a lock-in problem [with mortgages], which is that interest rates have gone up so high that it's compromising mobility for most people in the U.S. So people are sitting on 2% mortgages, and they're absolutely reluctant to move, even if there's a great job opportunity somewhere else, because they would have to refinance into a much higher rate.",
      "There's a feature of mortgage markets that exists in other places, which is called portability, where you simply take your old mortgage with you to the new place \u2014 you then get the lender to reassess the collateral on the new place, and then you're able to take your mortgage with you. That increases mobility and keeps the labor market functioning well.",
      "You could also have a different feature, which is called assumability, where the buyer of your house actually is able to take on your cheap mortgage, assuming that they pass the appropriate credit checks and so on.",
      "Both of those features, portability and assumability, would be really good additions to the U.S. mortgage market.",

    "summary": "Relief will take time, because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
    "story": [
      "As one of America's coffee capitals, Portland, Oregon, has grounds for worry: coffee prices have soared to historic highs.",
      "\"We have bags of coffee on our menu that are $28.50. That's a lot of money for a bag of coffee,\" said Laila Ghambari, owner of Guilder Coffee Company, a caf\u00e9 that sells specialty coffee.",
      "Ghambari and her brothers practically grew up inside an espresso machine. Her father owned a coffee shop, and Ghambari became the U.S. barista champion in 2014. Now, she's a small business owner grappling with the expense of tariffs, which are still impacting her business even though coffee and other products were granted an exemption last month.",
      "\"Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,\" Ghambari said.",
      "Coffee prices were already high due to supply and demand pressures for premium beans along with climate issues, especially crop-killing frost. The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee hit a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, according to\u00a0the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In December 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, one pound of ground coffee cost a little over $4. And in August, retail coffee prices in the U.S. had jumped 20.9% from the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 the sharpest increase in nearly three decades.",
      "Then, back in April, the U.S. imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 10% on coffee-producing countries. Ghambari said it cost her roughly fifty cents a bag.",
      "Christopher Hendon, a chemistry professor at the University of Oregon   known as \"Dr. Coffee,\" studies the global industry and said the tariffs cost independent coffee operators more than consumers.",
      "\"[The consumer is] probably not feeling it,\" Hendon said. \"You might not care today, because the price didn't change all that much, but you might care if your local caf\u00e9 disappears.\"",
      "Charlie Wicker's company, Trailhead Coffee Roasters, roasts green beans into brown ones. Tariffs hit him hard.",
      "\"I had to lay off the two full-time employees. So now it's down to just myself and one part-time employee,\" Wicker said, adding, \"The fact that we're still standing is a function of having a little bit of savings to keep the lights on.\"",
      "Despite the reversal that lifted tariffs on coffee, relief will take time because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
      "Ghambari said it won't be until February when the first import of tariff-free coffees will land in her warehouse.",
      "For Wicker, who delivers to caf\u00e9s, lifting those tariffs could be the coffee break he needs.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The man suspected of planting pipe bombs outside the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, is believed to be a supporter of President Trump and has been speaking with investigators, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The suspect, 30-year-old Brian Cole Jr., was arrested Thursday in Virginia and appeared at an initial hearing Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He faces two charges related to a pair of explosive devices that were left outside the parties' headquarters on the night before the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. The devices did not explode.",
      "Investigators have not revealed a potential motive. Two law enforcement sources said on Friday that Cole is believed to be a supporter of the president. Two other sources said Cole has been speaking with investigators since his arrest.",
      "Cole appeared in court wearing a khaki-green short-sleeve jumpsuit. He was represented by a private attorney, John Shoreman.",
      "Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya presided over the hearing and read the charges: attempted malicious destruction by fire and explosives, and transporting an explosive device across state lines. Cole did not enter a plea.",
      "Six family members were in the courtroom, and several said \"I love you\" as Cole exited. Shoreman, on behalf of the family, declined to comment. Cole's next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 15.",
      "The pipe bombs were discovered the afternoon of Jan. 6, when a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters breached the building, overwhelming nearby law enforcement. An affidavit from an unidentified FBI agent filed in support of the charges against Cole did not mention the Capitol attack.",
      "The devices did not detonate, but the FBI said they were viable and \"could have seriously injured or killed innocent bystanders.\" The bureau said last year that the suspect \"may still pose a danger to the public or themselves\" and offered a $500,000 reward for information leading to the suspect's arrest and conviction.",
      "The case had vexed the FBI for years. Investigators initially released footage of a potential suspect and details about the Nike shoes he was wearing when the bombs were planted, but made little apparent progress in cracking the case.",
      "According to the affidavit, cellphone records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states. Investigators said they have records of him buying components that were used to make the explosives.",
      "During a press conference Thursday announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to provide details about Cole's potential motive. Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to the arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.",
      "\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"",

    "story": [
      "Two people who survived an early September U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean were waving overhead before they were killed in a now-controversial second strike, according to two sources familiar with a video that was shown to lawmakers this week.",
      "One of the sources said the action could be interpreted as the survivors either calling for help or trying to wave off another strike.",
      "The additional details were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The Sept. 2 operation was the first of more than 20 attacks on alleged drug-carrying vessels by the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 a campaign that officials argue is necessary to stem narcotics trafficking, but critics believe is legally unjustified. More than 80 people have been killed in the strikes, including 11 people on Sept. 2, the military has said.",
      "The operation has drawn fresh scrutiny since a report last week that the U.S. military carried out a follow-up strike on the vessel, killing two people who survived the initial attack. Some Democrats and legal experts have argued a strike to kill shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has confirmed there was a second strike, but argued it was lawful and warranted to \"ensure the boat was destroyed.\"",
      "Members of Congress watched a video of the strikes \u2014 including the strike that killed the two survivors \u2014 during closed-door testimony on Thursday with the operation's commander, Adm. Mitch Bradley, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.",
      "But lawmakers offered starkly differing interpretations of the video after the hearing.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut told reporters the survivors appeared to be \"in clear distress without any means of locomotion,\" calling it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\" Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said the survivors were \"trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight,\" concluding the four strikes on Sept. 2 were \"entirely lawful and needful.\"",
      "Multiple lawmakers said Bradley testified that there was no order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to kill everybody onboard.",
      "President Trump said Wednesday he would support releasing a video of the strikes to the public. When asked by a reporter if he would support killing survivors, the president responded: \"No, I support the decision to knock out the boats.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's advisers and Ukrainian officials said Friday they'll meet for a third day of talks after making progress on creating a security framework for postwar Ukraine, and are urging Russia to commit to peace.",
      "The officials, who met for a second day in Florida on Friday, issued a joint statement that offered broad brushstrokes about the progress they say has been made as Mr. Trump pushes Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a U.S.-mediated proposal to end nearly four years of war.",
      "\"Both parties agreed that real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward de-escalation and cessation of killings,\" the statement reads. \"Parties also separately reviewed the future prosperity agenda which aims to support Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, joint U.S.\u2013Ukraine economic initiatives, and long-term recovery projects.\"",
      "The Kremlin did not immediately comment on the latest U.S.-Ukraine talks on Friday.",
      "U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's talks in Florida with Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's lead negotiator, follow discussions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the U.S. envoys at the Kremlin on Tuesday.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive.\"",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said earlier this week. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "However, Ushakov also added, \"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done.\"",
      "Ushakov said Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point proposal\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in talks last weekend with Ukrainian officials in Florida, had said those conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Friday's session with U.S. and Ukrainian officials took place at the Shell Bay Club in Hallandale Beach, Florida, a high-end private golf and lifestyle destination owned by Witkoff's real estate development company.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country's delegation in Florida wanted to hear from the U.S. side about the talks at the Kremlin.",
      "Zelenskyy, as well as European leaders backing him, have repeatedly accused Putin of stalling in peace talks while the Russian army tries to press forward with its invasion. Zelenskyy said in a video address late Thursday that officials wanted to know \"what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war and to pressure Ukraine.\"",
      "Speaking to Russian journalist Pavel Zarubin on Friday, Ushakov praised Kushner as potentially playing an important role in ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"If any plan leading to a settlement is put on paper, it will be the pen of Mr. Kushner that will lead the way,\" Ushakov said.",
      "The flattering comments about Kushner by the senior Russian official come as Putin has sought to sow division between Mr. Trump and Ukraine and Europe at a moment when Mr. Trump's impatience with the conflict is mounting. Putin, who made a state visit to India on Thursday, told an Indian media outlet that his five-hour talks this week with Witkoff and Kushner were \"necessary\" and \"useful,\" but some proposals were unacceptable.",
      "Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka, was a senior adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term and was the president's point person on developing the Abraham Accords, which formalized commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and a trio of Arab nations.",
      "Kushner has played a more informal role in Trump's second presidency, but he helped Witkoff close out ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas this fall. Mr. Trump tapped Kushner again to pair up with Witkoff to try to find an endgame to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",

    "summary": "President Trump has led the charge to create more GOP-friendly congressional districts in the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Indiana's state House on Friday passed a new congressional map that aims to make all nine of the state's U.S. House districts friendly to Republicans, after months of contentious debate and pressure from the Trump administration.",
      "The bill passed in a 57-41 vote and now heads to the GOP-controlled state Senate, which is reconvening on Dec. 8. A number of vocal Republicans in the Indiana Senate have held out against redistricting, although it's unclear if they are enough to prevent it from passing.",
      "President Trump congratulated members of the state House for passing the new map later Friday, and urged the Senate to take up the matter as soon as possible. He listed out nine state senators who he said \"need encouragement to make the right decision\" in a Truth Social post.",
      "On Wednesday, state Sen. Kyle Walker, one of the GOP holdouts, announced he would not be seeking reelection. Two other Republicans in the chamber who are not seeking reelection, Sens. Eric Bassler and Greg Walker, have also said they are opposed to redistricting.",
      "The contentious process among Indiana legislators had led to numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents against officials, state police said.",
      "Republican state Sen. Jean Leising, who opposed the redistricting effort in the state, said in a social media post Sunday that she was the target of a pipe bomb threat. She called the threat the \"result of the D.C. political pundits for redistricting,\" and added, \"I will not cave.\"",
      "The measure moved forward Monday through the Indiana House elections committee, with one Republican joining all four Democrats on the committee in opposition. Eight Republicans voted in favor.",
      "For months, the White House had been pushing Indiana, a state that Mr. Trump won by 19 points, to redraw its congressional map to try to edge out the two Democrats in the U.S. House. Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the administration met several times with Indiana Republicans to persuade them to redraw the map.",
      "Indiana Gov. Mike Braun called the legislature to reconvene for a special session in November to consider redistricting. But Senate President Rodric Bray insisted that the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, they simply agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "Before announcing that lawmakers would convene after all, Bray acknowledged in November that \"the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies stepped up threats on Republican holdouts in the legislature, with Mr. Trump calling some out by name on social media and promising they'd face primaries.",
      "Republicans and Democrats across the country have been scrambling to undertake mid-decade redistricting, a practice that was rarely undertaken until this year. With the GOP holding a slim majority in the U.S. House and facing down a historical trend that midterm elections tend to favor the party opposing the president, Mr. Trump first turned to Texas. There was historical precedent: Texas conducted mid-decade redistricting during the Bush administration, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2005.",
      "Texas' GOP-led legislature reconvened in the summer to redraw the state's maps to net up to five seats for Republicans. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed forward with a ballot measure known as Proposition 50 to redistrict his state to net up to five seats for Democrats, since California requires voter approval of its congressional map. Prop 50 passed on Election Day with more than 64% of the vote.",
      "Missouri and North Carolina's Republican legislatures have redrawn their maps in an attempt to gain a new seat in each state for Republicans. Meanwhile, Maryland Democrats have suggested they could undertake a similar effort to edge out the state's one Republican House member, though the idea has faced resistance from some Democratic legislators.",
      "The redistricting campaigns have drawn lawsuits in some states. The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed Texas to use its newly drawn congressional map for now, halting a lower court ruling that found the new map was racially gerrymandered.",

      "Congress appropriated about $144.7 billion for Afghanistan reconstruction from 2002 to 2021, but the U.S. failed to transform the country into a democracy, in part because of corrupt allies and the lack of a clear plan, according to the final report from the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, or SIGAR.",
      "The report, released earlier this week, is a collection of the inspector general's previous work, which taken together, \"highlights serious systemic issues with reconstruction and paints a picture of a two-decade long effort fraught with waste,\" acting inspector general Gene Aloise wrote at the beginning of the report.",
      "\"We were seeing what was happening all along. This was not what winning looked like,\" Aloise told reporters at a session of the Defense Writers Group earlier this week.",
      "\"The biggest thing throughout the whole 20 years was corruption affected everything,\" Aloise said, describing Afghanistan's government as \"essentially a white-collar criminal enterprise.\"",
      "He told reporters that since about 2012, the inspector general's quarterly reports showed systemic weaknesses, especially regarding the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, but more and more, the U.S. government wanted to classify sections of the reports.",
      "\"There were a lot of people on the Hill who were concerned, but every time we came out with some of these statistics, we were slapped down, and they were classified,\" Aloise said.",
      "The report does not specifically look at the withdrawal in 2021 but does give an estimate of what the U.S. left behind. The U.S. left about $38.6 billion behind in military equipment and infrastructure built by the U.S.",
      "SIGAR has not been contacted for any contribution to the Pentagon's current review of the withdrawal, ordered in May by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to Aloise.",
      "Aloise told reporters that after the withdrawal, the Biden administration stonewalled his office for about a year, claiming SIGAR's jurisdiction ended when the troops left Afghanistan, even though there was still money flowing to the country. It took pressure from Congress for the Biden administration, mostly the State Department and USAID, to resume cooperation.",
      "SIGAR was established in 2008 by Congress and will close Jan. 31. Over the course of its reports and investigations, it generated more than $4.6 billion in cost savings for the taxpayer and identified at least $26 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse.",
      "Aloise told reporters the losses could've been much higher, had the inspector general's office not existed.",
      "\"The deterrent effect of SIGAR was huge,\" Aloise said. \"We just keep thinking \u2013 if we're going into Gaza or we're going into Ukraine, and you don't have something like a SIGAR, you know, it's, it's not gonna work out well \u2013 for at least the United States taxpayer.\"",

    "summary": "ICE began enhanced operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area this week, as President Trump rails against Somali people in Minnesota.",
    "story": [
      "Federal immigration authorities this week began conducting enhanced operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, a U.S. official told CBS News, targeting a region with a large population of the Somali immigrants President Trump often rails against.",
      "The surge by Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to target individuals in the Twin Cities area with deportation orders, the official said. The exact scope and duration of the operation are not clear so far.",
      "Late Thursday, ICE released a list of 12 people who have been arrested since Monday, describing them in a news release as \"some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\" detained in the Twin Cities operation. Half of the arrestees were from Mexico, five were from Somalia and one was from El Salvador, the agency said. Just over half had criminal convictions, and the rest had arrests or charges, according to ICE.",
      "The crackdown comes as Mr. Trump castigates Minnesota's large community of Somali immigrants, regularly pointing to the country \u2014 often in incendiary terms \u2014 as a justification for his administration's sweeping mass deportation campaign.",
      "During a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia \"garbage\" and claimed they \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president said Tuesday. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"",
      "In recent days, the Trump administration has halted all immigration cases, including citizenship ceremonies, for people from Somalia and 18 other nations on its travel ban, and has ordered a reexamination of all green cards issued to immigrants from those countries, CBS News has reported.",
      "And last month, Mr. Trump said he was ending a deportation protection program called Temporary Protected Status for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people.\" The TPS program for Somalia is set to expire in March 2026, though the Department of Homeland Security has not formally announced its termination.",
      "Mr. Trump has also brought attention to a massive public assistance fraud scandal that has dogged Minnesota politics for years, in which dozens of defendants \u2014 most of whom are of Somali descent \u2014 were accused of bilking hundreds of millions of dollars from food aid, autism services and housing programs. The president has blamed Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the fraud schemes and claimed Somali immigrants have \"ripped off that state.\"",
      "Democratic officials and members of Minnesota's Somali community have denounced Mr. Trump's statements, with Walz on Thursday calling them \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"I am not garbage,\" Hamse Warfa, a Somali-born entrepreneur who lives in the Minneapolis area and runs a nationwide education nonprofit, told CBS News Minnesota. \"I'm a proud American citizen.\"",
      "Minnesota has one of the country's largest Somali populations, with some 76,000 people of Somali descent statewide \u2014 representing just over 1% of the state's population, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The state's Somali community grew after the East African country descended into civil war in the early 1990s, causing scores of people to flee Somalia, which still faces instability, threats of insurgency and poverty.",
      "In some cases, Somali refugees were resettled elsewhere in the U.S. before moving to Minnesota, drawn in many cases by job opportunities, safety, good schools and a longstanding network of nonprofits in the state that assist refugees, Somali American and Macalester College professor Ahmed Samatar told CBS News Minnesota in 2019. Just over half of Somali Minnesotans arrived in the U.S. before 2010, and one in five moved to the U.S. before 2000.",
      "As of last year, the vast majority of Somali Minnesotans were American citizens. Some 52% were born in the U.S., and another 42% are naturalized citizens, leaving just over 4,000 \u2014 or more than 5% \u2014 who don't hold U.S. citizenship, according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "From the start of Mr. Trump's second term in January to Oct. 15, ICE made 117 arrests of people with Somali citizenship nationwide, 28 of which were in Minnesota, according to figures from the Deportation Data Project. The agency made 1,694 total arrests in Minnesota over the same time period \u2014 around 1% of nationwide arrests.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan to end TPS for Somali immigrants could impact a very small number of people. Just over 700 immigrants from Somalia had been approved for TPS as of March of this year, according to federal government data. The Immigrant Law Center said Minnesota was home to 430 of those Somali TPS-holders in 2023.",

      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide the legality of President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide the legality of President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship, which automatically grants citizenship to nearly everyone born in the U.S.",
      "Issued at the start of his second term, the plan is the first from Mr. Trump's immigration agenda that the Supreme Court will evaluate on the legal merits. The justices have been asked to intervene in several challenges to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, but did so at early stages of the cases and through emergency requests for relief.",
      "No lower court that has been confronted with legal challenges to the birthright citizenship order has embraced the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. Still, the Justice Department has argued that those decisions are wrong, claiming that the Constitution does not grant citizenship to the children of \"temporary visitors or illegal aliens.\"",
      "Section 1 of the 14th Amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, said, \"No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"",
      "\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump's executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress,\" Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.\"",
      "Mr. Trump issued his executive order on birthright citizenship on his first day back in the White House. Under the plan, children born in the U.S. to parents who are either in the country illegally or on a temporary basis are not recognized as U.S. citizens.",
      "The president's directive sought to reverse more than a century of understanding that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces. The Supreme Court addressed the issue 127 years ago, ruling in 1898 that the Citizenship Clause ties U.S. citizenship to place of birth.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order is a pillar of his immigration agenda, but it has yet to take effect. The policy faced a slew of legal challenges soon after it was issued, and lower courts uniformly blocked its implementation. Then, the Supreme Court agreed to intervene during the early stages of three different cases, but did not consider the underlying legality of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "Instead, the issue before the justices was the scope of relief granted by lower courts hearing the birthright citizenship cases, which had issued nationwide injunctions preventing the administration from enforcing the policy. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, curtailed the ability of district court judges to issue those universal orders, but said plaintiffs could seek broad relief through class-action lawsuits. It also left open the possibility that states could secure nationwide relief.",
      "On the heels of that ruling, two babies subject to Mr. Trump's order and their parents, as well as a pregnant woman, filed a lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship order on behalf of a putative nationwide class. A federal district court in New Hampshire certified as a provisional class all babies who would be denied birthright citizenship by the president's plan and found that the order likely violates the Constitution.",
      "The district court barred the Trump administration from enforcing the plan against all impacted by it.",
      "The Supreme Court is taking up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit has weighed in.",
      "It did not act on another appeal involving four states, Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, that had been before the high court in a preliminary posture. In July, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order was invalid because it contradicts the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all born in the U.S.",
      "The 9th Circuit split 2-1 to leave in place a nationwide injunction that had been issued by a district court in February, finding it was necessary to give the states complete relief.",
      "The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to take up both cases and issue a final decision on whether Mr. Trump's executive order is constitutionally sound. Solicitor General D. John Sauer said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on U.S. soil confers citizenship, and said that understanding has had \"destructive consequences.\"",
      "But the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the New Hampshire case, argued that the Trump administration is effectively asking the Supreme Court to \"rewrite\" the Citizenship Clause and unwind more than a century of the nation's \"everyday practice.\"",
      "Arguments in the case are expected to take place next year, with a decision likely issued by the end of June or early July.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday granted the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from a federal investigation in Florida into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The Justice Department had renewed its request for the material to be made public last month after Congress passed and President Trump signed a law\u00a0that requires the attorney general to disclose records related to the government's investigation into Epstein.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rodney Smith granted the request from Justice Department officials in a brief order.",
      "In its motion to the court last month, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and other government lawyers wrote that the court should authorize the Justice Department to release the transcripts and lift any protective orders that would prevent disclosure to the public \"in light of the act's clear mandate.\"",
      "\"The Legislative and Executive Branches have nearly unanimously directed the Department of Justice to make records related to the Epstein and Maxwell investigations publicly available,\" they wrote.",
      "The Trump administration initially petitioned courts in Florida and New York in July to unseal grand jury materials after it faced backlash for a Justice Department memo that said any additional disclosure of information regarding Epstein was neither \"appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "The Justice Department said that a review of material related to Epstein conducted with the FBI concluded there was no \"client list\" or evidence that the late disgraced financier blackmailed prominent figures. Investigators also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties,\" according to the memo.",
      "Judges in Florida and New York denied those initial bids for the information to be released to the public, since federal rules generally require grand jury proceedings to be kept secret.",
      "But the Trump administration tried again following Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, arguing that the law should override grand jury secrecy rules. It said that any victim-related and personal identifying information would be redacted from the grand jury transcripts if unsealed.",
      "Grand juries were convened in West Palm Beach in 2005 and 2007 to investigate Epstein. He ultimately evaded federal charges at the time through a deal with prosecutors that allowed him to plead guilty to state prostitution charges. In 2019, he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges and died in custody.",
      "The material that Smith ordered to be unsealed is transcripts from those grand jury proceedings in Florida. It's unclear how quickly the information will be made public.",
      "Congress has separately been releasing information it has received through its own investigation into the federal government's handling of Epstein's case. It has made public a trove of emails and messages obtained from Epstein's estate, as well as photos and videos of his private island in the Caribbean.",

    "story": [
      "In July 2019, Minnesota state officials spotted early signs of fraud that would eventually siphon away more than $1 billion in taxpayer money, but they quickly faced pressure from leaders of the charitable group Feeding Our Future to stop asking questions, according to multiple former employees at the Minnesota Department of Education.",
      "The scandal, which has already led to 61 convictions, has widely been viewed as a byproduct of the COVID-19 pandemic. At one point, then-Attorney General Merrick Garland called it \"the largest pandemic relief fraud scheme\" in the United States.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Lisa D. Kirkpatrick said those convicted \"took advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to carry out a massive fraud scheme that stole money meant to feed children.\"",
      "But state officials say the schemes aimed at diverting federal dollars meant for people who are poor, food insecure or disabled, actually started far sooner, months after Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz took office in 2019. In its early stages, members of the charitable group Feeding Our Future billed the state for some $3.4 million.",
      "By 2021, however, that number ballooned. Before it was finally halted, Feeding Our Future had falsely claimed to have served 91 million meals, for which the group received nearly $250 million in federal funds, according to federal prosecutors. That money did not go to feed kids, federal officials said. Instead it was used to fund lavish lifestyles.",
      "Investigators say the money came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with oversight from state governments. In Minnesota, those funds were administered by the state Department of Education, with meals historically provided to kids through schools and day care centers.",
      "In recent weeks, renewed attention to the scandal has focused on the state's failure to identify and halt the theft before it spun out of control. Conservative politicians and bloggers have alleged the state's liberal establishment was cowed into inaction by intimidation from Feeding Our Future, which contracted within the state's large Somali community \u2014 because the food charity sought to paint early scrutiny of the nonprofit as racism.",
      "Well before the pandemic, state officials told CBS News that they began experiencing tension with the woman later convicted of masterminding the fraud, Aimee Bock. They began documenting her \"concerning\u00a0 behavior.\" One former employee told CBS News that Bock almost immediately began pressuring state workers who might have had follow up questions or concerns before processing reimbursements.",
      "Within weeks of Feeding Our Future's first submissions to the state, Minnesota workers also recognized that the charity was claiming to serve meals in numbers that were \"not consistent\" and \"not realistic,\" one official told CBS News.",
      "Then the pandemic took hold. The officials told CBS News the scheme rapidly accelerated. Safeguards fell away \u2014 removed intentionally to insure residents in need did not go hungry.",
      "But as state workers asked more questions \u2014 and even stopped payment on some receipts \u2014 Feeding Our Future ratcheted up pressure in response. In 2020, the charitable group filed a lawsuit alleging the state had \"harmed Feeding Our Future by subjecting it to additional procedural hurdles in violation of federal regulations.\"",
      "The state \"intentionally and wrongfully refuse[d] to do business with Feeding Our Future and the community it serves by discriminating \u2026 because of Feeding Our Future's race, national origin, color, and religion.\"",
      "A judge dismissed the civil case after the FBI executed search warrants on Feeding Our Future and made public its investigation in January 2022.",
      "The entire episode played out in the aftermath\u00a0of the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, as racial tensions ran high.",
      "Seven months later, federal prosecutors first announced criminal charges against 47 people in the Feeding Our Future scandal. The number charged grew to 78 in total, and 59 have since been convicted, including Bock, who is awaiting sentencing.",
      "Reached by phone on Thursday, Bock's attorney Kenneth Udoibok said his client plans to appeal her conviction. He denied Bock exerted pressure on state officials so they would not properly scrutinize meal claims.",
      "\"That doesn't meet the smell test,\" Udoibok said. \"A government agency with all its resources, and its reputation is afraid of Amy? That is just rich. It's a lie.\"",
      "Udoibok said the state Department of Education employees leveling the accusation weren't acknowledging their own role in the massive fraud.",
      "\"No one in the state of Minnesota, no one in the Department of Education has taken any responsibility for this fraud that they allowed to go through,\" he said",
      "While Bock, who is White, was described by investigators as the mastermind, most of the other defendants and alleged co-conspirators are Somalis, provoking fresh attacks from the Trump administration against the state's large Somali community.",
      "In recent days, President Trump has claimed Somali migrants \"ripped off\" Minnesota and has referred to the state as a \"hellhole.\" He has called people from Somalia \"garbage\" who \"contribute nothing\" and said: \"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you.\" This week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement began enhanced operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, home to a large population of Somalis.",
      "Walz on Thursday said Mr. Trump's comments are \"unprecedented for a United States president,\" and he denounced Trump's barrage of anti-Somali statements as \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Walz said on \"Meet the Press\" last weekend that the fraud cases are \"totally disconnected\" from the broader Somali community. \"To demonize an entire community on the actions of a few, it's lazy,\" he said.",
      "House Republicans on Wednesday launched an investigation into the governor's handling of the fraud cases. Walz has long been criticized for being slow to act, but he has said his administration caught the fraud early and reported it first to the USDA, and then to the FBI.",
      "Prosecutors have charged nearly a dozen others in cases involving other alleged COVID-related fraud in Minnesota. The schemes are alleged to have operated similarly to the original one focused on nutrition funds, but these involve housing assistance and behavioral health services.",
      "Prosecutors in all those cases have charged an additional eight people, most of whom are Somali, bringing the total number charged to 87, with 61 convictions. Sources at the U.S. attorneys office tell CBS News the investigations are ongoing in all of the fraud cases, including Feeding Our Future, with the total amount of stolen money reaching more than $1 billion.",

      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was carrying illicit narcotics and transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific,\" said U.S. Southern Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Central and South America. \"Four male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel were killed.\"",
      "Since early September, the U.S. military has launched at least 22 strikes on vessels in the Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean that the Trump administration claims, without providing more evidence, are trafficking drugs.",
      "At least 87 people have been killed in the strikes so far. Thursday's was the first known strike\u00a0since Nov. 15.",
      "The boat attacks are part of larger efforts by the White House to put pressure on the regime of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The Trump administration says the operations \u2014 the details of which remain sparse \u2014 are part of an anti-drug offensive. Hegseth has\u00a0dubbed\u00a0the wider anti-trafficking effort Operation Southern Spear.",
      "The president has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations.",
      "The latest strike also comes as Hegseth has faced scrutiny in the wake of a recent Washington Post report over a Sept. 2 boat strike in the Caribbean that killed 11 people. The report claimed the U.S. military struck the boat with two missiles, a revelation that the White House confirmed.\u00a0A source familiar with the matter\u00a0told CBS News on Wednesday that the second strike came as two people who survived the first missile were trying to climb back onto the boat. The survivors were allegedly trying to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. Some lawmakers have questioned whether the second strike constitutes a war crime.",
      "Hegseth has denied that he ordered the second strike, saying that the decision was made by Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, head of Special Operations Command. The Washington Post report also alleged Hegseth had said that everybody on board the boat should be killed, which he has denied, and which Bradley also denied, lawmakers who were briefed on the strikes told reporters.",
      "On Thursday, congressional lawmakers held a closed-door session during which they were shown video of that second strike and were briefed on the incident by Bradley and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "After seeing the video, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,\" while Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he \"didn't see anything disturbing about it.\"",

      "As intrigue grows over whether Texas Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett plans to announce a U.S. Senate campaign next week, she confirms she's spoken with would-be opponents about the race.",
      "Crockett said earlier this week she will make a \"special announcement\" in Dallas at 4:30 p.m. Monday, 90 minutes before the state's deadline for candidates to file their campaign paperwork.",
      "\"I cannot confirm what I will be announcing,\" Crockett, who represents most of Dallas in Congress, told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "But she acknowledged calling some of the current candidates in the race last Sunday to discuss polling that she had received and to answer any questions they might have.",
      "Crockett, 44, has amassed a national following and fundraising base after less than four years in Congress, fueled especially by her frequent appearances on national cable news programs and active social media accounts that highlight confrontations with Republicans in committee hearings.",
      "She has declined to rule out a campaign for Senate next year, and told CBS News Texas last month she would only run if polling she commissioned showed she could win a general election by expanding the electorate and attracting new voters.",
      "Former Dallas Democratic Rep. Colin Allred and Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, of Austin, are already campaigning to take on whoever emerges from an equally high-stakes GOP primary involving Sen. John Cornyn, a four-term incumbent who's being challenged by Republican Rep. Wesley Hunt and Attorney General Ken Paxton.",
      "A poll conducted between late September and Oct. 1 by the University of Houston and Texas Southern University showed Crockett leading a hypothetical Democratic primary with 31%. Talarico and former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who is not running, were tied for second place with 25% each. Allred had 13%, and 6% were unsure.",
      "But the same poll showed Republicans Cornyn, Hunt and Paxton defeating Crockett. The other Democratic candidates also trailed the GOP contenders in general election polling.",

      "Allred didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday.",

      "\"It's tough for those guys, if she runs, she is popular with the Democratic base,\" said the lawmaker, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about ongoing intra-party deliberations. \"From polling I've seen, she will be in the driver's seat if she runs. ... A couple of months ago, I didn't believe it, but now I would say there is a better than average chance that she runs.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 21:44:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Authorities say the FBI has arrested a man suspected of placing pipe bombs outside RNC and DNC headquarters on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
    "story": [
      "A northern Virginia man was arrested and accused of placing two pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, federal authorities announced Thursday.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi identified the suspect as Brian Cole Jr., a 30-year-old from Woodbridge, Virginia, located just outside Washington, D.C. Cole was charged with use of an explosive device, Bondi said, adding that more charges were possible in the investigation, which was still active and ongoing. He's the first suspect arrested in the yearslong pipe bomb investigation.",
      "Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge and works in a bail bondsman's office, an FBI agent said in court documents. The school district for Prince William County, Virginia, which includes Woodbridge, confirmed to CBS News that Cole graduated from high school in 2013.",
      "Cole was arrested early Thursday morning and investigators were still executing search warrants in the afternoon, Bondi told reporters during a news conference.",
      "An unidentified FBI agent said in a probable cause affidavit filed Wednesday that Cole allegedly bought multiple items in 2019 and 2020 that were consistent with the components used to make the pipe bombs.",
      "According to the affidavit, cellphone provider records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states.",
      "The court documents don't make any references to the Capitol riot that took place the following day. During Thursday's news conference, Bondi didn't provide details about the suspect's possible motive.",
      "\"Right now, it's ongoing,\" she said. \"Again, we just executed the search warrant early, early this morning. It's ongoing, but America's safer, D.C.'s safer because he's in custody.\"",
      "Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to Thursday's arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.",
      "\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said a team of experts reevaluated the evidence, describing them as \"the best at what they do in their specific fields.\"",
      "\"When you develop evidence, you get a search warrant, and when you get a search warrant, you get an address, and when you get an address, you hit the house, and that's what we did,\" Patel said.",
      "The arrest marks a major step forward in a case that has vexed the FBI for nearly five years.  The pipe bombs were placed outside DNC and RNC headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5, federal investigators have said.",
      "The devices \u2014 made out of 1x8-inch pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder \u2014 did not detonate, but the FBI has called them viable and warned they could have killed or injured people.",
      "The bombs were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as police in the area were overwhelmed by rioting at the Capitol building nearby. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the DNC headquarters shortly after the devices were found.",
      "\"We are grateful to the law enforcement officers who have dedicated years to investigating the pipe bombs planted at the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6th insurrection,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said following the arrest. \"Those responsible for this horrific act must be brought to justice, and political violence should never be accepted in America.\"",
      "Over the subsequent months and years, federal law enforcement scoured the country for alleged Capitol riot participants, tracking down and charging more than 1,500 people.",
      "But the pipe bomb case had remained a lingering mystery amid the events of that week. The FBI had not made an arrest or identified a suspect before Thursday, though it has periodically released footage of a potential suspect \u2014 grainy security camera images of a shadowy figure in a hoodie \u2014 and offered $500,000 for information.",
      "In May, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X the pipe bomb investigation was one of several unsolved cases that had drawn \"additional resources and investigative attention.\" He said he had received weekly briefings on the case and the FBI was \"making progress.\"",
      "Nick  Kurtz and \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "In a one-page order, a panel of appellate judges issued an administrative stay to give them more time to consider the issue, writing that their move \"should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion.\" The Trump administration has asked for a longer-term pause of U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb's ruling.",
      "Cobb had concluded last month that President Trump's military deployment in the nation's capital, which includes a mixture of D.C. National Guard forces and Guard troops from other states, illegally intrudes on local officials' authority to direct law enforcement in the district.",
      "Cobb found that while the president does have authority to protect federal functioning and property, he can't unilaterally deploy the D.C. National Guard to help with crime control as he sees fit or call in troops from other states. She put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the appeal by the Trump administration.",
      "The Trump administration called Cobb's ruling a \"wholly unjustified incursion into the territory of both the President and Congress\" in an appeals court filing last week.",
      "\"As we have always maintained, the President exercised his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard to D.C. We look forward to ultimate vindication on this issue,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Associated Press.",
      "In August, Mr. Trump issued an executive order declaring a crime emergency in Washington. Within a month, more than 2,300 National Guard troops from eight states and the District were patrolling the city under the command of the Secretary of the Army. Mr. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist in patrols.",

      "The court action comes eight days after two West Virginia National Guard members, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national identified as the suspect and who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.",

      "The administration has also deployed Guard troops to Los Angeles and tried to send troops into Chicago and Portland, Oregon, prompting other court challenges.

    "summary": "The Pentagon watchdog released its report on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to share details about operations in Yemen.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth jeopardized sensitive military information that could have endangered American service members when he shared certain details about U.S. military operations in Yemen in a private Signal group chat earlier this year, according to a report\u00a0the Pentagon's inspector general released Thursday morning.",
      "The report found the former Fox News host-turned-defense secretary violated Defense Department policies when he used his personal device for official business to transmit sensitive U.S. military information to other top Trump officials and the editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine. CBS News reported the key findings of the report ahead of its release based on multiple sources. Hegseth and his office also violated federal law by not retaining official records, the report said.",
      "\"Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,\" the report said.",
      "The report also said Hegseth's \"actions created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed U.S. mission objectives and potential harm to U.S. pilots.\"",
      "A classified version of the inspector general's report was sent to Congress on Tuesday. An unredacted version was released Thursday.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the review \"is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along - no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.\"",
      "Hegseth also called the review a \"total exoneration,\" writing on X: \"No classified information. Total exoneration. Case closed. Houthis bombed into submission. Thank you for your attention to this IG report.\"",
      "The report said that while Hegseth has the authority to declassify information as secretary, \"based on our review, we concluded that some information from the secretary sent from his personal cell phone on Signal on March 15, 2025, matched the operational information USCENTCOM sent and classified as SECRET/NOFORN.\" CBS News previously\u00a0reported\u00a0on the classified source of information and that it had been shared by Army Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla, who at the time was the commander of U.S. Central Command, the primary combatant unit overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of South Asia.",
      "According to U.S. Central Command's Security Classification Guide, the operational movement of aircraft should be classified as SECRET, the report found. However, the secretary of defense is authorized to declassify information as appropriate, but according to Defense Department manuals reviewed by CBS News, the defense secretary is required to notify individuals when either downgrading or declassifying information and to use appropriate classification markers when communicating the information.",
      "The report suggests Hegseth did not notify individuals on the Signal chat that he had declassified the information, nor did he notify U.S. Central Command, which would mean the unit still considered the information to be classified.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means the information was classified, and the disclosure of the information without proper declassification could potentially cause serious damage to national security and jeopardize the safety of service members, according to the U.S. government.",
      "The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "Hegseth declined to be interviewed for the report, the inspector general said, opting instead to respond to questions in writing.",
      "The secretary did not provide his personal cell phone to the IG, according to the report. His office did provide some messages that matched those published in the Atlantic, but excluded \"a number of messages that had auto-deleted by the time the information was captured from the Secretary's phone because of settings in the chat.\"",
      "The IG was told Hegseth posted the same information in separate Signal chats, so the IG requested copies of messages from other group chats. Because the IG did not have access to Hegseth's phone, he was not \"able to verify whether any of the additionally identified Signal chats also contained sensitive, classified, or other nonpublic DoD information.\"",
      "The sources familiar with the inspector general's investigation said the report found that if the information had been intercepted by a foreign adversary, it would have clearly endangered U.S. service members and the mission.",
      "A day after the Signal chat story was published by The Atlantic, U.S. Africa Command, in coordination with the government of Somalia, conducted multiple airstrikes against affiliates of the Islamic State terrorist organization. A press release said the airstrikes occurred near the Golis Mountains in Somalia and that multiple \"ISIS-Somalia operatives were killed.\"",
      "After multiple Trump administration officials claimed the information in the Signal chat group was unclassified, CBS News filed a request in March under the Freedom of Information Act to U.S. Africa Command to see if similar information deemed unclassified by Hegseth from the Yemen airstrike could be released regarding the March 25 airstrike on the ISIS operatives in Somalia.",
      "CBS News requested information about the airstrike that was similar to the information appearing in the Signal chat group about the strikes and that Trump intelligence officials had said was unclassified.",
      "In early September, CBS News received a response from U.S. Africa Command, which arrived at the same conclusion as the Pentagon inspector general about the Somalia airstrike \u2014 that the material if released could jeopardize national security.",
      "\"[The] information that is currently and properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526. \u2026 In this case, I have determined that the release of the documents would foreseeably harm national security,\" Marine Maj. Gen. Matthew Trollinger, the chief of staff to Air Force Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson, the commander of U.S. Africa Command, wrote in his letter to CBS News.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the IG's review \"affirms what the Administration has said from the beginning \u2014 no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.\"",
      "She went on to say, \"The President's entire national security team is doing great work advancing American interests while protecting sensitive information,\" adding, \"President Trump stands by Secretary Hegseth.\"",
      "In separate statements on Wednesday, the top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees called for Hegseth to resign.",
      "Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said the report \"notes that the IG is aware of several other Signal chats Hegseth used for official business, underscoring that this was not an isolated lapse. It reflects a broader pattern of recklessness and poor judgment from a secretary who has repeatedly shown he is in over his head.\"",
      "\"Pete Hegseth's behavior and lack of judgment would be a fireable offense for anyone else in the Department of Defense,\" Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said. \"What's more, his refusal to sit for an interview with the Inspector General or submit his device for examination is yet another example of his failure to take responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a veteran who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS News in an interview that the report showed \"a jaw-dropping breach of our national security, and Hegseth needs to resign immediately.\"",
      "\"When you tell somebody that 30 minutes after the drone strikes, our aircraft will be on position at this location, that's classified information in the f---ing middle of an operation. You're telling the enemy, 'hey, by the way, 30 minutes after the drones hit, be ready to shoot our aircraft out of the sky, because they're going to be there.' That's classified operational information,\" Duckworth said. \"And this argument that Hegseth has the authority just by sharing it, he declassified, it doesn't make it right.

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 20:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has recently attacked Gov. Tim Walz over the fraud cases, calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and lashing out against the state's Somali community.",
    "story": [
      "A series of multimillion-dollar alleged fraud schemes in Minnesota has drawn the Trump administration's attention in recent weeks, vaulting an issue that has brewed in state politics for years into the national conversation.",
      "President Trump has called Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" and has lashed out against the state's Somali community as most of the fraud defendants were of Somali descent \u2014 drawing stiff criticism from local officials. This week, the administration launched enhanced immigration operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. House Republicans launched an investigation Wednesday into Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the fraud cases, and the U.S. Treasury said Monday it will look into whether tax dollars from Minnesota made their way to al Shabaab, a Somali-based al Qaeda affiliate. And federal prosecutors have continued to bring new charges against alleged fraudsters in the Midwestern state in recent months.",
      "Here's what to know about the cases:",
      "What was the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme?",
      "Three years ago, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed the first charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\"",
      "The $250 million scheme \u2014 which now includes upward of 75 defendants \u2014 revolved around a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, prosecutors say, Feeding Our Future and its affiliated food distribution sites submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices to trick state and federal officials into thinking they had helped serve food to thousands of children. The group allegedly raked in millions in administrative fees for the fake meal distributions, and got kickbacks from people who ran their distribution sites, according to federal charging documents.",
      "Feeding Our Future's founder, Aimee Bock, was convicted at trial earlier this year. Several other defendants, including distribution site operators, have pleaded guilty or been convicted, in some cases receiving multiyear prison sentences and being ordered to pay millions in restitution. One defendant also pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe a juror, after a member of the jury in his fraud trial found a bag with $120,000 in cash at her home.",
      "Bock has long denied wrongdoing. At various points before charges were filed, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of distribution sites, leading Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of discrimination.",
      "The case was part of a trend of large-scale fraud across the U.S. during the pandemic, as the federal government poured money into assistance programs at a rapid clip. One former federal watchdog estimated to \"60 Minutes\" earlier this year that COVID-19 fraud may have cost taxpayers some $1 trillion.",
      "Prosecutors said the program that was allegedly co-opted by Feeding Our Future \u2014 the Federal Child Nutrition Program \u2014 became more vulnerable to fraud due to changes during the pandemic. Oversight was more difficult because of the health crisis, and federal officials waived some of the program's rules to let restaurants participate and allow off-site meal distribution.",
      "State officials have faced scrutiny for their handling of the situation. A probe last year by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor found the Minnesota Department of Education \"created opportunities for fraud\" by failing to act on warning signs with Feeding Our Future or investigate complaints about the group.",
      "The report also found that officials felt they needed to handle Feeding Our Future carefully because the group had responded to a 2020 slowdown in food site approvals by accusing the Minnesota Department of Education of racial discrimination and of depriving needy children of food. In the Feeding Our Future's lawsuit against the state, it noted that it \"caters to members of a protected group of racial minorities and foreign nationals.\"",
      "The auditor's office said \"the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention affected MDE's decisions about the regulatory actions it did and did not take against Feeding Our Future.\"",
      "What other fraud allegations have circulated in Minnesota?",
      "The Feeding Our Future scheme isn't the only fraud case to rattle Minnesota politics.",
      "In August, state officials shut down a fairly new program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities find housing after discovering \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "A month later, federal prosecutors charged eight people with allegedly defrauding the program, which was run through the state's Medicaid service, by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the housing stabilization program was susceptible to fraud because it intentionally had \"low barriers to entry\" and few recordkeeping requirements. They also noted that spending on the program had ballooned to more than $100 million last year, despite initial estimates that it would cost around $2.6 million a year.",
      "And in late September, a person was charged with defrauding a third state program \u2014 in this case, one that provides services to children with autism. Her company was accused of hiring unqualified \"behavioral technicians\" and submitting false claims to the state that indicated the staff had worked with children enrolled in the program.",
      "She also allegedly paid kickbacks to parents who agreed to enroll their children in the program, in some cases sending them as much as $1,500, prosecutors said.",
      "The same person, Asha Farhan Hassan, was also charged in September with running a fraudulent food distribution site as part of the Feeding Our Future scheme.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said the case \"is not an isolated scheme.\"",
      "\"From Feeding Our Future to Housing Stabilization Services and now Autism Services, these massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money,\" the federal prosecutor wrote in a statement.",
      "Kelly Loeffler, who leads the U.S. Small Business Administration, also alleged Tuesday that some of the groups linked to the Feeding Our Future scheme received COVID-era emergency loans. She said she has ordered an \"investigation into the network of Somali organizations and executives implicated in these schemes.\" She did not provide details on the probe.",
      "What is the connection to Minnesota's Somali community?",
      "Most of the people charged in the Feeding Our Future case are of Somali descent, though Bock, the group's founder and the scheme's alleged \"mastermind,\" is White.",
      "Prosecutors in the alleged autism services fraud scheme said the defendant \"approached parents in the Somali community to recruit their children.\"",
      "The named fraud defendants appear to represent a small percentage of Minnesota's Somali American community, which is among the largest in the nation.",
      "Some 76,000 people of Somali descent live in the state, more than half of whom were born in the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures from last year. The vast majority of the state's foreign-born Somali population has U.S. citizenship, and most entered the U.S. before 2010.",
      "Around 65% of Somali people in Minnesota ages 16 and over were employed as of last year, according to the Census Bureau, roughly equivalent to the state population as a whole.",
      "Last year, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office, Kayseh Magan, wrote about what he called an \"uncomfortable and true\" reality that many people who have been charged with fraud in the state are of Somali descent.",
      "He wrote that \"fraud occurs when desire meets opportunity,\" noting that many Somali Americans are \"poor, desperate and seek shortcuts,\" and their families in the impoverished East African country frequently rely on money from their U.S.-based relatives. He said Somali service providers often leverage trust within the community to recruit friends and relatives into their programs. Many victims of these fraud schemes are Somali, too, he added.",
      "Has Minnesota taxpayer money made its way to the terror group al Shabaab?",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that his department will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia.",
      "Bessent appeared to be responding to a report in the conservative magazine City Journal that alleged millions from state programs \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources.",
      "Those allegations have circulated for years. A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that Child Care Assistance Program funding is going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have been sent overseas and eventually found their way to terrorists.",
      "Multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "Andy Lugar, a Biden- and Obama-era U.S. attorney for Minnesota, told The Minnesota Star Tribune last month that those charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme \"were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.\"",
      "What has President Trump said?",
      "Mr. Trump has blamed the fraud schemes on Somali people, whom he has attacked in often incendiary terms in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the president called immigrants from Somalia \"garbage,\" and claimed they \"destroyed Minnesota\" and \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "Last month, the president announced he would end temporary deportation protections for Somali immigrants who live in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State,\" and that Minnesota has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"",
      "Somalia is also one of 19 countries that have faced near-total travel bans and a halt to immigration applications. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations are underway this week in the Minneapolis area, CBS News has reported.",
      "A particular focus of Mr. Trump's ire is Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager. He has also lashed out at Walz, whom he referred to last week using a slur for people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "Minnesota lawmakers and members of the state's Somali community have castigated Mr. Trump for the comments. In an interview with \"Meet The Press\" last weekend, Walz said the fraud issue \"is totally disconnected with demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better.\"",
      "What has Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said about the fraud schemes?",
      "Walz, who has served as Minnesota's governor since 2019, told NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that his state has sought to crack down on fraud. He also pointed to the state's generosity.",
      "\"Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We're AAA-bond rated,\" said the governor and 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee. \"But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We're doing everything we can.\"",
      "Asked this week about the U.S. Treasury's investigation into claims that tax money may have gone to al Shabaab, Walz said the state welcomes federal help and wants to crack down on fraud, but added: \"I don't think anybody in here really believes their motive and their timing,\" referring to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, the governor and his administration have faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud, dating back to the Feeding Our Future scheme's emergence in 2022. Republican officials have long argued the state failed to carry out due diligence and was slow to act in that scheme \u2014 though Walz has insisted the state caught the fraud early but was stymied by court battles and asked by the FBI not to cut off payments during its investigation.",
      "That scrutiny has resurged in recent weeks. Earlier Wednesday, Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs.",
      "\"The Committee has serious concerns about how you as the Governor, and the Democrat-controlled administration, allowed millions of dollars to be stolen,\" Comer said in a letter requesting documents from Walz. \"The Committee also has concerns that you and your administration were fully aware of this fraud and chose not to act for fear of political retaliation.\"",

    "summary": "Investigations released by the Navy into accidents involving the Truman Carrier Strike Group recommended ensuring processes are followed even when faced with adversity.",
    "story": [
      "When the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier lost an F-18 fighter jet in May because of an arresting wire failure, the crew was in the midst of \"significantly stressful deployment\"\u00a0 because of operations against the Houthis in Yemen, according to a Navy investigation report released Thursday.",
      "The Navy said in a statement Thursday that investigations into a series of accidents involving the Truman carrier strike group \"reviewed how a Carrier Strike Group prepares for and responds to adversity during combat operations.\"",
      "From March 15 to May 6, the Truman participated in \"Operation Rough Rider,\" which targeted the Houthis who were attacking merchant ships and U.S. Navy ships.",
      "During this period, aircraft flew for 52 days, including 72 hours of continuous flight operations. Flight crews conducted more than 1,000 air strikes against the Houthis with more than one million pounds of ordnance.",
      "Over the course of its full deployment from September 2024 through May 2025, the carrier strike group had a friendly fire incident in December \u2014 when a Navy destroyer launched missiles at two F-18s \u2014 a collision with a merchant ship in February and lost two F-18s, one in April and another in May.",
      "\"The Navy is committed to being a learning organization,\" Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jim Kilby said in a statement. \"These investigations reinforce the need to continue investing in our people to ensure we deliver battle-ready forces to operational commanders.\"",
      "Kilby told reporters that \"appropriate accountability actions have been taken,\" but the investigations redacted the sections about what those actions were and whether they were taken during or after the deployment.",
      "The investigations found a multitude of factors were to blame for each incident, but overall, the recommendations in the investigations include service members better adhering to Navy processes, especially in a combat environment.",
      "\"All of these mishaps were avoidable, whether they were combat related or not,\" according to a Navy official who spoke with reporters ahead of the release of the investigations.",
      "No service members were killed as a result of the four incidents, but there were close calls. In the friendly fire incident, the crew members of one of the F-18 fighter jets targeted in error saw the missile from the USS Gettysburg pass \"one to two plane lengths\" behind them, according to the investigation. The crew of the other F-18 ejected as the missile approached and were rescued by helicopter.",
      "During the February collision near the Suez Canal, about eight personnel were working approximately 10 feet away from the area of impact. The investigation notes that if the collision had occurred about 100 feet forward, it would've struck an area of the aircraft carrier where 120 sailors were sleeping.",
      "All of the incidents combined cost the Navy about $164 million, according to figures released in the investigations, combined with the estimated cost of an F-18 aircraft.",
      "When the USS Gettysburg destroyer fired two missiles at aircraft flying back to the Truman, one crew ejected, leaving the estimated $67 million F-18 jet behind. After the February collision, temporarily fixing the impacts carried a price tag of about $685,000, with a full repair expected post-deployment.",
      "The investigations into the two F-18 losses in April and May found the estimated cost was $36,141,169 and $60,259,238, respectively, including the cost of other damaged equipment.",

    "summary": "Details about the strikes on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2 have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved more than one strike, including one that killed survivors of the initial attack.",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The new details about the strike on Sept. 2 have now led some lawmakers to openly question whether the attack on the survivors was a war crime.",
      "Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, the commander who oversaw the Sept. 2 operation,\u00a0briefed small groups of lawmakers on the strikes on Thursday.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters after the classified briefings that Bradley said he had not been ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \"kill everybody,\" as was\u00a0reported\u00a0last week by the Washington Post.",
      "But Himes added that the lawmakers were shown video of the second strike, and said that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\" Cotton defended the attack, saying he \"saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight.\"",
      "As lawmakers continue to pursue the facts of what occurred on Sept. 2, doubts about the legality of the ongoing campaign against the alleged drug boats persist, with experts and former officials saying the strikes were shaky ground even before the latest revelations.",
      "The boat strikes",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" President Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "Analysis from The Free Press:\u00a0Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an \"expeditious declassification\" of the legal opinion in\u00a0a letter\u00a0last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,\" they wrote. \"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.\"",
      "Consent from Congress",
      "Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.",
      "In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.",
      "The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\"",
      "The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.\" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.",
      "But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services Committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.",
      "\"Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,\" says former military prosecutor",
      "The Trump administration's claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "\"There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,\" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.",
      "Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.",
      "\"They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,\" Finucane said.",
      "Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.",
      "\"There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,\" Hansen said.",
      "Trump \"wants it both ways,\" expert says",
      "The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an \"armed conflict\" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.",
      "If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the intentional killing of survivors may have.",
      "The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\"",
      "The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, \"it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter.\" The rule applies \"during non-international armed conflict.\"",
      "\"The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,\" Hansen said.",
      "The Post reported that a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, a detail that CBS News has not confirmed. Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin \u2014 Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.",
      "After Thursday's briefing, however, Cotton said there had been no change in how the military is treating survivors.",
      "\"There has been no change in the guidance or the order that the secretary has given to our troops,\" the Arkansas Republican said. \"In subsequent strikes, there is an example where survivors actually were shipwrecked and distressed and not trying to continue on their mission, and they were treated as they should be, as noncombatants.\"",
      "The second strike and what laws may have been broken",
      "There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that killed two survivors is a war crime.",
      "Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that it would be \"an illegal act\" that is \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.\"",
      "\"I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,\" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.",
      "\"If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,\" Hansen said. \"So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody \u2014 even if you think they're a criminal \u2014 without adjudication.\"",
      "\"Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,\" Hansen added. \"Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.\"",
      "Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.",
      "\"Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\" he said.",
      "If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.",
      "\"Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,\" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. \"In short, they are war crimes.\"",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in an interview with CBS News\u00a0on Monday.",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 19:15:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal prosecutors on Thursday presented an indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James to a grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "Federal grand jurors declined to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James\u00a0on Thursday, a U.S. official said, marking another blow to the government's case after a judge tossed out the Justice Department's bank fraud charges against the Trump foe last week.",
      "The grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia, voted down an indictment after it was presented by federal prosecutors, the official said.",
      "Last week, a judge dismissed charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, was improperly appointed to her role. The judge gave the government the opportunity to re-charge them.",
      "It's extraordinarily rare for grand juries to decline to indict people.",
      "Federal prosecutors investigated more than 150,000 people in the 2016 fiscal year, and in only six cases reported not bringing charges because the grand jury voted down an indictment, according to Justice Department figures.",
      "James thanked the grand jury in a statement Thursday, writing: \"As I have said from the start, the charges against me are baseless. It is time for this unchecked weaponization of our justice system to stop.\"",
      "Her attorney, Abbe Lowell, said the case \"should never have existed in the first place,\" and warned that if the government continues to try to prosecute James, \"it will be a shocking assault on the rule of law and a devastating blow to the integrity of our justice system.\"",
      "The New York attorney general was initially charged in October with bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution. The Justice Department accused James of falsely claiming on mortgage documents that a house she bought in 2020 in Norfolk, Virginia, would serve as her second home, when she actually rented it out and used it as an investment property. The government claims she was able to get a more favorable interest rate by calling it a second home.",
      "James has denied wrongdoing and argued the Trump administration is targeting her for political reasons. In between President Trump's terms in the White House, James sued him in civil court for allegedly lying about the value of his real estate assets.",
      "In 2023, a judge ruled Mr. Trump, his family and his company \"repeatedly\" violated fraud law and imposed a nine-figure judgment against them in the case brought by James. An appeals court threw out the financial penalties earlier this year, calling them \"excessive.\" The appellate judges were divided on the merits of the case and did not strike down some non-financial penalties, including restrictions on the Trump Organization.",
      "James's attorneys have argued the case against her should be tossed out due to vindictive prosecution and \"outrageous government conduct.\" They've argued the charges stemmed from Mr. Trump's enmity toward James \u2014 pointing to a Truth Social post in which the president urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into her \u2014 and were the product of \"unethical behavior\" by several officials at the Justice Department and the Fair Housing Finance Authority.",
      "Halligan's office sought charges against Comey and James following upheaval in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Her predecessor as the office's top prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned in late September amid fears among staff that he would be forced out for refusing to charge James, CBS News has previously reported. Days later, Halligan \u2014 a former White House staffer and personal attorney to Mr. Trump \u2014 was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney. Comey was indicted less than a week after that, and James was indicted a few weeks later.",
      "Both Comey and James argued that Halligan was not legally appointed to her role, and asked for their charges to be tossed out. U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie dismissed their indictments without prejudice, meaning the government could attempt to indict them again.",
      "It's unclear whether the Justice Department will also try to re-indict Comey for allegedly lying to Congress in 2020, since the statute of limitations for those charges expired in late September. A federal law gives the government a six-month extension when indictments are dismissed after the statute of limitations for a case expires, but Currie wrote in her order that the law may not apply in Comey's case because the indictment may not have been valid to begin with.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Thursday that Democrats will offer a clean three-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for a vote next week, when the issue that was at the center of the shutdown fight comes center stage.",
      "\"This is the bill, a clean three-year extension of ACA tax credits, that Democrats will bring to the floor of the Senate for a vote next Thursday, and every single Democrat will support it,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday morning.",
      "The announcement comes after a group of Senate Democrats last month secured a vote to address the expiring tax credits as part of the deal to reopen the government. Millions of Americans are due to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket in the new year without action from Congress.",
      "Democrats had the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice. Some moderates sought a compromise position that would stand a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance. Schumer's decision to seek a clean extension means the bill is highly unlikely to pick up support from Republicans, although the move so will force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Republicans rejected Schumer's offer of a clean extension toward the end of the government shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:32:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Ant colonies act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, according to a team of scientists.",
    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

    "summary": "Samples collected from the asteroid Bennu are continuing the shed light on the origins of the solar system and how life developed on Earth, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",

He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:16:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-birth-dose/",
    "published": "Sat, 06 Dec 2025 11:08:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, with members appointed by RFK Jr., voted to change longstanding recommendations on the hepatitis B vaccine.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel voted Friday to change the recommendation for when children should get their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. Instead of a first dose within 24 hours of birth \u2014 as the CDC has advised for more than 30 years \u2014 the panel voted to recommend delaying it until a child is 2 months old for children born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "The panel voted, in a 8-3 decision, to recommend individual decision-making in consultation with a health care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a child whose mother tested negative for the virus.",
      "Many medical experts and organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed such a change, saying it will leave young children at risk of an infection that can cause lifelong illness. They point to decades of research confirming the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.",
      "The decision came on the second day of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' December meeting, after confusion on Thursday led to the vote being delayed.",
      "The panel \u2014 whose\u00a0members were all appointed\u00a0by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 began the day\u00a0 with a reading of the proposed voting language, followed by discussion from the panel members and other experts. Restef Levi, an ACIP member and mathematician who has no medical training, strongly argued against the universal birth dose, falsely claiming that experts had \"never tested (the vaccines) appropriately.\" Levi said he believed the committee should not recommend any timeline for the vaccine.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel and an ACIP board member, and committee member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln continued to criticize the efforts to change the recommendations. Hibbeln said this was the fourth version of the language presented in 96 hours, and that \"no rational science has been presented\" to support changing the recommendations. Meisner emphasized that leaving the recommendation as-is would still allow parents to make their own choices about the vaccines their child receives.",
      "\"We've heard 'do no harm' as a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording,\" Meissner said as he voted to oppose the change.",
      "Hepatitis B is an incurable viral infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and early death. The hepatitis B vaccine has been universally recommended for newborns in the U.S. since 1991. Over that time,\u00a0research shows\u00a0hepatitis B infections among infants and children have dropped 99%.",
      "Recommendations from the advisory committee, known as ACIP, go to the CDC director for approval. Ultimately, decisions are left\u00a0to the states, which tend to base their policies off the CDC's guidelines but can\u00a0choose\u00a0to set\u00a0their own. ACIP's recommendations also carry weight with insurance companies: Most private insurers are required to cover the recommended vaccines. If the recommendation changes, what's covered by insurance may also change.",
      "The birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine has become a target of vaccine critics, including Kennedy, who falsely claimed on a podcast in June that it was a \"likely culprit\" in\u00a0autism.",
      "The birth dose of the vaccine has a\u00a0long track record, and multiple studies show the shot is not associated with any increased risk of\u00a0infant death,\u00a0fever or sepsis,\u00a0multiple sclerosis\u00a0or\u00a0autoimmune conditions. Severe reactions to the vaccine are rare.\u00a0Research also shows\u00a0there is no evidence of any safety benefit in waiting until a child is older.",
      "The panel also voted Friday in a 6-4 decision, with one abstention, to recommend parents consult with their doctors about whether to have their children tested to see if the first vaccine dose gave them a certain level of protection against hepatitis B. Typically, the vaccine is given as part of a three-dose series. Some panelists criticized the lack of data showing one dose was as effective as three doses and called the language of the recommendation confusing.",
      "Reactions pour in after vote",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and who is also a physician whose medical practice focused on hepatitis B, called the change \"a mistake\" and urged acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill to reject ACIP's vote.",
      "\"The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate,\" Cassidy wrote\u00a0on social media. \"Before the birth dose was recommended, 20,000 newborns a year were infected with hepatitis B. Now, it's fewer than 20. Ending the recommendation for newborns makes it more likely the number of cases will begin to increase again. This makes America sicker.\"",
      "In a recent interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Cassidy said he was \"very concerned\"\u00a0about the impact of such a change.",
      "O'Neill said in a statement that he believed the public \"benefited from the committee's well-informed, rigorous discussion about the appropriateness of a vaccination in the first few hours of life.\"",
      "President Trump praised the committee\u00a0on Truth Social\u00a0for their \"very good decision.\" His post included various false claims, including about how many vaccines babies receive, and how hepatitis B is transmitted.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he had \"just signed a Presidential Memorandum\" directing HHS to 'FAST TRACK' a comprehensive evaluation of Vaccine Schedules from other Countries around the World\" and compare them to the U.S.",
      "\"Peer, developed countries recommend fewer childhood vaccinations,\" Trump alleged in the memorandum that was released later Friday.",
      "The\u00a0memorandum\u00a0directs Kennedy and O'Neill to review other developed countries that the White House says recommend fewer immunizations for children and, if the evidence shows those countries' recommendations are superior, update the U.S.'s vaccine schedule to \"align with such scientific evidence.\"",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0says\u00a0vaccine recommendations are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" and differences may be due to factors like costs, availability and different public health needs.",
      "Kennedy has also criticized the vaccine schedule for American children. Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine division, said in a separate memo sent to FDA staffers that he would examine vaccine schedules. The topic was discussed in the second half of ACIP's meeting on Friday, but no votes were taken.",
      "Experts criticized the panel's vote. Dr. Ulrich von Andrian, President of the American Association of Immunologists, said in a statement that the medical organization is \"extremely disappointed\" in the decision.",
      "\"Delaying the vaccine would mark a dangerous departure from decades of achievement in preventing hepatitis B infection and its complications. Recent independent analysis warns that even a modest delay could result in a substantial increase in preventable chronic infections, liver cancers, and deaths,\" Andrian said. \"Now is not the time to undermine confidence in one of the most successful vaccine-based public health interventions in modern history.\"",
      "A contentious 2-day meeting",
      "Following Friday's vote on the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel planned to discuss childhood vaccination schedules and some vaccine ingredients, but there are no other votes scheduled, according to a public agenda.",
      "The meeting began on Thursday morning, with the hepatitis B recommendation vote originally scheduled for that afternoon. Panel members presented information on the prevalence of acute and chronic hepatitis B, and discussed transmission and safety data.",
      "Meissner sharply criticized the presentations, especially one that claimed there was little safety data for the hepatitis B birth dose.",
      "Dr. Jason Goldman, liaison to the ACIP for the American College of Physicians, called the meeting \"completely inappropriate\" and accused the panel of \"wasting taxpayer dollars by not having scientific, rigorous discussion on issues that truly matter.\" Goldman also highlighted that the hepatitis B birth dose is not mandated and that parents are encouraged to make individual decisions in consultation with their doctor.",
      "The vote was delayed until Friday after some members complained that the panel had seen multiple versions of the questions to vote on, and a technical issue prevented the most recent voting language from being displayed. There was uncertainty about how many questions members would be asked to vote on, and there were no hard copies of the language available. Committee member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln said the panel was being asked \"to evaluate a moving target.\"",
      "Similar confusion\u00a0pervaded ACIP's September meeting, when members admitted they didn't know what they were voting on, first rejecting a combined measles-mumps-rubella-chickenpox vaccine for young toddlers before voting to keep it funded minutes later. They reversed themselves on the funding the following day.",
      "Why are newborns vaccinated for hepatitis B?",
      "Newborns who become infected with hepatitis B from their mother at birth and infants who contract the virus within the first year of their life have a 90% chance of developing chronic hepatitis B, an illness that can cause life-threatening issues including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. About\u00a025%\u00a0of those patients end up dying prematurely as a result.",
      "Previous research has shown that if the vaccine is only given to babies whose mothers tested positive, many cases get missed.",
      "The CDC recommends that pregnant women get tested for hepatitis B, but about 16% of expecting mothers fall through the cracks, according to the agency.",
      "\"The birth dose has served as a critical safety net in the U.S. healthcare system \u2014 to protect against gaps in prenatal screening, missed HBV [hepatitis B virus] diagnoses, communication errors, and inconsistent follow-up,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0the Vaccine Integrity Project of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Many schools and child care facilities require a child be vaccinated for hepatitis B because it is contagious, spread through contact with blood or bodily fluids or via contaminated surfaces.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics says the first dose of the vaccine given soon after birth provides crucial protection, and warned that delaying it would leave children vulnerable.",
      "\"The hepatitis B vaccine has ... one of the most well established safety records of any vaccine,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, told CBS News ahead of the meeting. \"We've been using it for a long time. It's one of our best tools to protect babies from chronic illness and liver cancer.\"",
      "He added, \"This is a situation where one missed case is too many.\"",
      "This story has been updated to correct a reference to the first vote total; it was 8-3.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The man suspected of planting pipe bombs outside the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, is believed to be a supporter of President Trump and has been speaking with investigators, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The suspect, 30-year-old Brian Cole Jr., was arrested Thursday in Virginia and appeared at an initial hearing Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He faces two charges related to a pair of explosive devices that were left outside the parties' headquarters on the night before the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. The devices did not explode.",
      "Investigators have not revealed a potential motive. Two law enforcement sources said on Friday that Cole is believed to be a supporter of the president. Two other sources said Cole has been speaking with investigators since his arrest.",
      "Cole appeared in court wearing a khaki-green short-sleeve jumpsuit. He was represented by a private attorney, John Shoreman.",
      "Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya presided over the hearing and read the charges: attempted malicious destruction by fire and explosives, and transporting an explosive device across state lines. Cole did not enter a plea.",
      "Six family members were in the courtroom, and several said \"I love you\" as Cole exited. Shoreman, on behalf of the family, declined to comment. Cole's next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 15.",
      "The pipe bombs were discovered the afternoon of Jan. 6, when a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters breached the building, overwhelming nearby law enforcement. An affidavit from an unidentified FBI agent filed in support of the charges against Cole did not mention the Capitol attack.",
      "The devices did not detonate, but the FBI said they were viable and \"could have seriously injured or killed innocent bystanders.\" The bureau said last year that the suspect \"may still pose a danger to the public or themselves\" and offered a $500,000 reward for information leading to the suspect's arrest and conviction.",
      "The case had vexed the FBI for years. Investigators initially released footage of a potential suspect and details about the Nike shoes he was wearing when the bombs were planted, but made little apparent progress in cracking the case.",
      "According to the affidavit, cellphone records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states. Investigators said they have records of him buying components that were used to make the explosives.",
      "During a press conference Thursday announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to provide details about Cole's potential motive. Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to the arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.",
      "\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"",

    "story": [
      "Free days at the U.S. National Parks have been changed to no longer include Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth, just weeks after the Trump administration announced it would be raising fees for visitors who are not American citizens or permanent residents.",
      "June 14, which is both Flag Day and President Trump's birthday, will be included, according to a list shared by the NPS.",
      "Previously, Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth were deemed fee-free days by the Biden administration.",
      "Most of the free days are patriotic in nature, including Presidents' Day (February 16), Memorial Day (May 25), Independence Day weekend (July 3-5), Constitution Day (September 17) and Veterans Day (November 11). The 110th birthday of the National Park Service (August 25) and the birthday of President Theodore Roosevelt (October 27), considered the founder of the National Park Service, are also free days.",
      "Those who are not U.S. citizens or residents will still have to pay entrance fees and applicable nonresident fees on those dates, the NPS said.",
      "About 100 of the nation's 400 parks collect an entrance fee. The costs vary by park. The Trump administration announced earlier this week that each visitor who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident will have to pay a $100 non-resident fee at 11 popular parks. An annual pass that currently costs $80 will cost non-residents $250 beginning in 2026.",
      "The announcement\u00a0follows a July executive order\u00a0in which Mr. Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists. At the time, Mr. Trump also ordered the Department of the Interior to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place. In its 2026 fiscal year\u00a0budget proposal\u00a0released in May, the department estimated that such a surcharge on international visitors would generate more than $90 million annually.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum\u00a0said on social media\u00a0that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers \"continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.",

      "One of the two inmates accused of violent crimes who remained on the run after escaping from a southwestern Louisiana jail earlier this week has been taken into custody, according to CBS affiliate KLFY. A third inmate who joined the breakout died by suicide after being caught by police, officials said.",
      "KLFY reported that Jonathan Joseph, 24, was taken into custody without incident. Joseph is facing several charges, including principal to first-degree rape. He was arrested in connection with a drive-by shooting earlier this week, KLFY said.",
      "Joseph Harrington, 26, faced several felony charges, including home invasion. He was recognized by a tipster while pushing a black e-bike on Thursday. Police found the e-bike at a neighboring home and heard a gunshot while trying to coax him to leave the building. He had shot himself with a hunting rifle, Port Barre Police Chief Deon Boudreaux said by telephone to The Associated Press.",
      "Keith Eli, 24, remains at large. He faces an attempted second-degree murder charge. Anyone who spots Eli should call 911 or the sheriff's office immediately, KLFY reported, and not approach him.",
      "The three men escaped the St. Landry Parish Jail early Wednesday after discovering \"a degrading part of an upper wall area and over time, removed the mortar allowing them to remove concrete blocks and provide their exit,\" Sheriff Bobby J. Guidroz\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Authorities said the inmates then used sheets and other materials to scale the exterior wall, climb onto a first-floor roof and lower themselves to the ground, Guidroz said.",
      "Additional details about the escape were not immediately available. Guidroz said it will be investigated internally. Sheriff's department spokesperson Maj. Mark LeBlanc warned residents to secure their homes and vehicles, and said anyone who aided the escapees would be prosecuted.",
      "LeBlanc wasn't aware of the building being breached similarly in the past, but noted that anyone would try to escape with enough time and opportunity.",
      "\"These three were just a little more creative than in years past,\" he said.",

      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",

      "\"Some callers did not survive,\" he said in a video posted on Facebook Thursday. \"We ask that you keep them and their family members, loved ones and friends in your thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "McCall said that starting at 2:52 a.m. on July 4, the Kerrville Police Department, which was staffed by only two people at the time, began receiving 911 calls. The dispatchers answered a total of 435 emergency calls, including 106 calls alone between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m., he said.",
      "One woman who called from Camp Mystic, a summer camp for girls where more than two dozen people died, said on a call, \"There is water everywhere, we cannot move. We are upstairs in a room and the water is rising.\"",
      "\"If the water will be higher than the room, what should we do?\" she asked.",
      "\"How do we get to the roof if the water is so high?\" she asked in a later call. \"Can you already send someone here? With the boats?\"",
      "She also asked the dispatcher when help would come. \"I don't know. I don't know,\" the dispatcher said.",
      "Another caller told a dispatcher a house had washed away.",
      "\"Our cabin is up on stilts, and there are cabins floating and knocking into our cabin,\" one woman said. \"There is no higher ground. We are on the second level right now, but we're also on stilts and if they collapse, we're down.\"",
      "One woman said she and her family were \"currently trapped in our house. We are actively breaking out through the back.\"",
      "The recording captured the sound of a baby crying and loud repeating bangs.",
      "\"We're breaking a hole in the roof right now,\" she explained.",
      "About one mile from Camp Mystic, one woman said girls had been rescued who had been spotted floating downstream.",
      "\"We've already got two little girls who have come down the river and we've gotten to them, but I'm not sure how many else are out there,\" she said. \"We've been able to grab them and that's all we've seen so far.\"",
      "The Kerrville Police Department said it worked with the Texas Attorney General's Office and determined that all the calls should be released without redaction in order to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests made by eight media outlets.",
      "McCall praised the 911 dispatchers for showing \"incredible perseverance\" amid the high call volumes to \"provide assistance and comfort to every caller.\"",
      "\"Once the basic critical information was collected and no more assistance over the phone could be provided, telecommunicators were faced with the difficult decision to disconnect and move on to the next call,\" he said.",
      "Most deaths during the floods were\u00a0along the Guadalupe River\u00a0in Kerr County, including at least 27 campers and staff from Camp Mystic. Many of the campers who died were the\u00a0camp's youngest attendees.",
      "Last month, the families of several campers and counselors who died in the flash flood filed a lawsuit accusing the camp and its owners of gross negligence and reckless disregard for safety.",

      "The\u00a0Hill Country region\u00a0is naturally prone to\u00a0flash flooding\u00a0because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.",

      "In 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The number of cases in Texas alone grew to over\u00a0760\u00a0before the state declared it officially over in August, while total cases nationwide have topped 1,800, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well. In South Carolina, for example,\u00a0dozens of students were quarantined in October due to an outbreak.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Wednesdays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak primarily affected\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history\u00a0of making\u00a0false and misleading claims\u00a0about vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0spread in the Southwest.",
      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview\u00a0in April, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",

      "\"She wasn't quite as friendly in the very beginning,\" Sida told CBS News. \"But after a little while, she found her way into a lot of people's hearts, I guess you could say.\"",
      "Cats can do that. For nearly a decade, this former stray was a constant presence in the garden department. She'd become a local celebrity. Then one day, a few months ago, Francine vanished.",

      "Schneider figured Francine must have wandered onto a freight truck bound for a massive Lowe's distribution center in Statesville, North Carolina, about 85 miles away. If so, she could have been anywhere in the distribution center, hiding in the piles of pallets, or tucked in the rows of trucks.",
      "\"Maybe they opened the trailer up and she got out,\" Schneider said. \"We would never find her.\"",
      "But Schneider said he had to try. So, he elicited the help of distribution center warehouse managers Preston Bullock and Taylor Taconet.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 19:55:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Netflix on Friday said it will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix on Friday said it is buying Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, merging the biggest streaming service with a storied studio that has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.",
      "In a statement, Netflix said the deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

      "Indiana's state House on Friday passed a new congressional map that aims to make all nine of the state's U.S. House districts friendly to Republicans, after months of contentious debate and pressure from the Trump administration.",
      "The bill passed in a 57-41 vote and now heads to the GOP-controlled state Senate, which is reconvening on Dec. 8. A number of vocal Republicans in the Indiana Senate have held out against redistricting, although it's unclear if they are enough to prevent it from passing.",
      "President Trump congratulated members of the state House for passing the new map later Friday, and urged the Senate to take up the matter as soon as possible. He listed out nine state senators who he said \"need encouragement to make the right decision\" in a Truth Social post.",
      "On Wednesday, state Sen. Kyle Walker, one of the GOP holdouts, announced he would not be seeking reelection. Two other Republicans in the chamber who are not seeking reelection, Sens. Eric Bassler and Greg Walker, have also said they are opposed to redistricting.",
      "The contentious process among Indiana legislators had led to numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents against officials, state police said.",
      "Republican state Sen. Jean Leising, who opposed the redistricting effort in the state, said in a social media post Sunday that she was the target of a pipe bomb threat. She called the threat the \"result of the D.C. political pundits for redistricting,\" and added, \"I will not cave.\"",
      "The measure moved forward Monday through the Indiana House elections committee, with one Republican joining all four Democrats on the committee in opposition. Eight Republicans voted in favor.",
      "For months, the White House had been pushing Indiana, a state that Mr. Trump won by 19 points, to redraw its congressional map to try to edge out the two Democrats in the U.S. House. Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the administration met several times with Indiana Republicans to persuade them to redraw the map.",
      "Indiana Gov. Mike Braun called the legislature to reconvene for a special session in November to consider redistricting. But Senate President Rodric Bray insisted that the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, they simply agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "Before announcing that lawmakers would convene after all, Bray acknowledged in November that \"the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies stepped up threats on Republican holdouts in the legislature, with Mr. Trump calling some out by name on social media and promising they'd face primaries.",
      "Republicans and Democrats across the country have been scrambling to undertake mid-decade redistricting, a practice that was rarely undertaken until this year. With the GOP holding a slim majority in the U.S. House and facing down a historical trend that midterm elections tend to favor the party opposing the president, Mr. Trump first turned to Texas. There was historical precedent: Texas conducted mid-decade redistricting during the Bush administration, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2005.",
      "Texas' GOP-led legislature reconvened in the summer to redraw the state's maps to net up to five seats for Republicans. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed forward with a ballot measure known as Proposition 50 to redistrict his state to net up to five seats for Democrats, since California requires voter approval of its congressional map. Prop 50 passed on Election Day with more than 64% of the vote.",
      "Missouri and North Carolina's Republican legislatures have redrawn their maps in an attempt to gain a new seat in each state for Republicans. Meanwhile, Maryland Democrats have suggested they could undertake a similar effort to edge out the state's one Republican House member, though the idea has faced resistance from some Democratic legislators.",
      "The redistricting campaigns have drawn lawsuits in some states. The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed Texas to use its newly drawn congressional map for now, halting a lower court ruling that found the new map was racially gerrymandered.",

      "The report, released earlier this week, is a collection of the inspector general's previous work, which taken together, \"highlights serious systemic issues with reconstruction and paints a picture of a two-decade long effort fraught with waste,\" acting inspector general Gene Aloise wrote at the beginning of the report.",
      "\"We were seeing what was happening all along. This was not what winning looked like,\" Aloise told reporters at a session of the Defense Writers Group earlier this week.",
      "\"The biggest thing throughout the whole 20 years was corruption affected everything,\" Aloise said, describing Afghanistan's government as \"essentially a white-collar criminal enterprise.\"",
      "He told reporters that since about 2012, the inspector general's quarterly reports showed systemic weaknesses, especially regarding the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, but more and more, the U.S. government wanted to classify sections of the reports.",
      "\"There were a lot of people on the Hill who were concerned, but every time we came out with some of these statistics, we were slapped down, and they were classified,\" Aloise said.",

      "SIGAR has not been contacted for any contribution to the Pentagon's current review of the withdrawal, ordered in May by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to Aloise.",
      "Aloise told reporters that after the withdrawal, the Biden administration stonewalled his office for about a year, claiming SIGAR's jurisdiction ended when the troops left Afghanistan, even though there was still money flowing to the country. It took pressure from Congress for the Biden administration, mostly the State Department and USAID, to resume cooperation.",
      "SIGAR was established in 2008 by Congress and will close Jan. 31. Over the course of its reports and investigations, it generated more than $4.6 billion in cost savings for the taxpayer and identified at least $26 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse.",
      "Aloise told reporters the losses could've been much higher, had the inspector general's office not existed.",
      "\"The deterrent effect of SIGAR was huge,\" Aloise said. \"We just keep thinking \u2013 if we're going into Gaza or we're going into Ukraine, and you don't have something like a SIGAR, you know, it's, it's not gonna work out well \u2013 for at least the United States taxpayer.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal regulators said they are expanding an investigation into Waymo this week, following reports that the company's self-driving cars\u00a0navigated around school buses stopped on the road in Austin, Texas.",
      "In a letter to Waymo dated Dec. 3, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it will investigate the performance of the autonomous vehicles and their ability to follow traffic safety laws.\u00a0Reuters\u00a0first reported the news.",
      "The Austin Independent School District told CBS News it is now aware of 20 incidents this school year in which a Waymo vehicle illegally passed a school bus. All 50 U.S. states have laws requiring vehicles to halt for a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and a deployed stop-arm signal,\u00a0according to the NHTSA.",
      "Waymo said it identified the software issue that contributed to the school bus incidents and that it implemented updates by Nov. 17, which it said improved its vehicles' performance. The company is also planning to issue a voluntary software recall with NHTSA next week, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, chief safety officer at Waymo, told CBS News late Friday.",
      "\"We will continue analyzing our vehicles' performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement,\" said Pe\u00f1a.",
      "Local officials in Austin say they remain concerned about road safety.",
      "\"As of Dec. 1, 2025, Waymo received its 20th citation since the beginning of the school year,\" JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the Austin Independent School District, told CBS News. \"This is after the company said it had fixed the issue through software updates that were implemented on Nov. 17.\"",
      "In a Nov. 20\u00a0letter\u00a0to Waymo, the school district called on the robotaxi company to cease operations within the school district during the hours when students are loading and unloading from school buses until software updates are completed and Waymo can guarantee its vehicles will comply with the law.",
      "Maldonado said the company \"refused to cease operations\" during the hours the school district had requested.",
      "In response to a request for comment about the NHTSA probe, Waymo pointed to its overall safety record.",
      "\"Safety is our top priority, and the data shows we are improving road safety in the communities in which we operate, achieving a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians,\" a Waymo spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Waymo did not comment on its response to the Austin school district's request to suspend service when students are getting on and off buses.",
      "In October, NHTSA launched a probe into the company after an incident in Atlanta, Georgia, in which a Waymo vehicle drove around a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and its stop arm deployed.",
      "While maneuvering around the bus, NHTSA said the vehicle passed the bus' stop arm and a safety device that swings out from the bus close to where students were disembarking. At the time of the incident, no safety operator was present in the self-driving vehicle, according to the NHTSA.",
      "Atlanta Public Schools, a school district, told CBS Atlanta they are aware of six cases where Waymo cars illegally passed stopped school buses.",
      "Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, first started offering its fully autonomous vehicle service to the public in October 2020 in Phoenix. The company now offers hundreds of thousands of driverless rides each week in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and Atlanta.",

    "story": [
      "Frank Gehry, the renowned architect who was known for designing the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, has died, a representative confirmed to CBS News. He was 96.",
      "Gehry died Friday in his home in Santa Monica, California, after a brief respiratory illness, Meaghan Lloyd, his chief of staff at Gehry Partners LLP, told CBS News in an email.",
      "He won every major prize that architecture has to offer, including the field's top honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize, for what has been described as \"refreshingly original and totally American\" work.",
      "Gehry's fascination with modern pop art led to the creation of some of the most wildly imaginative buildings ever constructed and brought him a measure of worldwide acclaim seldom afforded any architect.",
      "In addition to Spain's Guggenheim Museum and LA's Walt Disney Concert Hall, his many masterpieces include Berlin's DZ Bank Building and an expansion of Facebook's Northern California headquarters at the insistence of the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. He also designed the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park and the BP Pedestrian Bridge, which connects Millennium Park to Maggie Daley Park.",
      "Other honors include the Royal Institute of British Architects gold medal, the Americans for the Arts lifetime achievement award and his native country's highest honor, the Companion of the Order of Canada.",
      "Years after he stopped designing ordinary looking buildings, word surfaced in 2006 that the pedestrian Santa Monica mall project that had led to his career epiphany might be headed for the wrecking ball. Gehry admirers were aghast, but the man himself was amused.",
      "\"They're going to tear it down now and build the kind of original idea I had,\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Eventually the mall was remodeled, giving it a more contemporary, airy outdoor look. Still, it's no Gehry masterpiece.",
      "Gehry, meanwhile, continued to work well into his 80s, turning out heralded buildings that remade skylines around the world.",
      "The headquarters of the InterActiveCorp, known as the IAC Building, took the shape of a shimmering beehive when it was completed in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood in 2007. The 76-story New York by Gehry building, once one of the world's tallest residential structures, was a stunning addition to the lower Manhattan skyline when it opened in 2011.",
      "That same year, Gehry joined the faculty of his alma mater, the University of Southern California, as a professor of architecture. He also taught at Yale and Columbia University.",
      "Not everyone was a fan of Gehry's work. Some naysayers dismissed it as not much more than gigantic, lopsided reincarnations of the little scrap-wood cities he said he spent hours building when he was growing up in the mining town of Timmins, Ontario.",
      "Princeton art critic Hal Foster dismissed many of his later efforts as \"oppressive,\" arguing they were designed primarily to be tourist attractions. Some denounced the Disney Hall as looking like a collection of cardboard boxes that had been left out in the rain.",
      "Still other critics included Dwight D. Eisenhower's family, who objected to Gehry's bold proposal for a memorial to honor the nation's 34th president. Although the family said it wanted a simple memorial and not the one Gehry had proposed, with its multiple statues and billowing metal tapestries depicting Eisenhower's life, the architect declined to change his design significantly.",
      "If the words of his critics annoyed Gehry, he rarely let on. Indeed, he even sometimes played along. He appeared as himself in a 2005 episode of \"The Simpsons,\" in which he agreed to design a concert hall that was later converted into a prison.",
      "He came up with the idea for the design, which looked a lot like the Disney Hall, after crumpling Marge Simpson's letter to him and throwing it on the ground. After taking a look at it, he declared, \"Frank Gehry, you've done it again!\"",
      "\"Some people think I actually do that,\" he would later tell The AP.",
      "Ephraim Owen Goldberg was born in Toronto on Feb. 28, 1929, and moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1947, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen. As an adult, he changed his name at the suggestion of his first wife, who told him antisemitism might be holding back his career.",
      "Although he had enjoyed drawing and building model cities as a child, Gehry said it wasn't until he was 20 that he pondered the possibility of pursuing a career in architecture, after a college ceramics teacher recognized his talent.",
      "\"It was like the first thing in my life that I'd done well in,\" he said.",
      "He went on to earn a degree in architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954. After serving in the Army, he studied urban planning at Harvard University.",
      "His survivors include his wife, Berta; daughter, Brina; sons Alejandro and Samuel; and the buildings he created.",
      "Another daughter, Leslie Gehry Brenner, died of cancer in 2008.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide the legality of President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide the legality of President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship, which automatically grants citizenship to nearly everyone born in the U.S.",
      "Issued at the start of his second term, the plan is the first from Mr. Trump's immigration agenda that the Supreme Court will evaluate on the legal merits. The justices have been asked to intervene in several challenges to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, but did so at early stages of the cases and through emergency requests for relief.",
      "No lower court that has been confronted with legal challenges to the birthright citizenship order has embraced the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. Still, the Justice Department has argued that those decisions are wrong, claiming that the Constitution does not grant citizenship to the children of \"temporary visitors or illegal aliens.\"",
      "Section 1 of the 14th Amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, said, \"No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"",
      "\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump's executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress,\" Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.\"",
      "Mr. Trump issued his executive order on birthright citizenship on his first day back in the White House. Under the plan, children born in the U.S. to parents who are either in the country illegally or on a temporary basis are not recognized as U.S. citizens.",
      "The president's directive sought to reverse more than a century of understanding that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces. The Supreme Court addressed the issue 127 years ago, ruling in 1898 that the Citizenship Clause ties U.S. citizenship to place of birth.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order is a pillar of his immigration agenda, but it has yet to take effect. The policy faced a slew of legal challenges soon after it was issued, and lower courts uniformly blocked its implementation. Then, the Supreme Court agreed to intervene during the early stages of three different cases, but did not consider the underlying legality of Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "Instead, the issue before the justices was the scope of relief granted by lower courts hearing the birthright citizenship cases, which had issued nationwide injunctions preventing the administration from enforcing the policy. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, curtailed the ability of district court judges to issue those universal orders, but said plaintiffs could seek broad relief through class-action lawsuits. It also left open the possibility that states could secure nationwide relief.",
      "On the heels of that ruling, two babies subject to Mr. Trump's order and their parents, as well as a pregnant woman, filed a lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship order on behalf of a putative nationwide class. A federal district court in New Hampshire certified as a provisional class all babies who would be denied birthright citizenship by the president's plan and found that the order likely violates the Constitution.",
      "The district court barred the Trump administration from enforcing the plan against all impacted by it.",
      "The Supreme Court is taking up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit has weighed in.",
      "It did not act on another appeal involving four states, Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, that had been before the high court in a preliminary posture. In July, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order was invalid because it contradicts the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all born in the U.S.",
      "The 9th Circuit split 2-1 to leave in place a nationwide injunction that had been issued by a district court in February, finding it was necessary to give the states complete relief.",
      "The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to take up both cases and issue a final decision on whether Mr. Trump's executive order is constitutionally sound. Solicitor General D. John Sauer said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on U.S. soil confers citizenship, and said that understanding has had \"destructive consequences.\"",
      "But the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the New Hampshire case, argued that the Trump administration is effectively asking the Supreme Court to \"rewrite\" the Citizenship Clause and unwind more than a century of the nation's \"everyday practice.\"",
      "Arguments in the case are expected to take place next year, with a decision likely issued by the end of June or early July.",

    "story": [
      "Some workers will receive pay boosts next year as higher minimum wage regulations take effect in 22 states and 66 cities and counties across the U.S., a change that could help low-income households grappling with an\u00a0affordability crisis.",
      "On Jan. 1, 2026, the minimum wage is set to rise in 19 states and 49 cities and counties, for a total of 68 jurisdictions, according to a report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy organization for workers.",
      "Later in the year, an additional four states and 22 cities will boost their baseline wages, providing more relief to the lowest-paid U.S. workers, according to the group's analysis.",
      "Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the federal wage floor remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has been stuck since 2009. Given the rise in the cost of living in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have chosen to boost their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"Policies increasing the minimum wage have been a lifeline for underpaid workers who have been the most impacted by a growing affordability crisis,\" the NELP report states.",
      "Here's where minimum wages will rise in 2026:",
      "Jan. 1 minimum wage increases",
      "Beginning Jan. 1, workers in 60 jurisdictions will earn a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour. In three states and 40 localities, the minimum wage for some or all employers will reach or exceed $17 an hour.",
      "For example, in New Jersey, the wage floor for long-term care workers will rise to $18.92 an hour. New York City, Long Island and Westchester will all increase their baseline pay to $17 an hour.",
      "In some cases, minimum wage changes will be based on the size of the employer. For instance, large employers in Hayward, California \u2014 a city near San Francisco \u2014 will be required to pay workers a minimum of $17.79 an hour, although the figure for small establishments is $16.90.",
      "In Novato, California, another city in the Bay Area, the wage floor will increase according to employer size. For very large employers, or those with more than 100 workers, the minimum wage will rise to $17.73 an hour. Large employers, or those with 26 to 99 employees, will see a baseline pay of $17.46. Small employers, or those with 25 or fewer workers, will have a minimum wage of $16.90.",
      "Cost-of-living adjustments, raises designed to help workers' pay keep up with inflation, are driving minimum wage increases in 13 states and 44 cities and counties across the U.S., according to the NELP report.",
      "\"In the face of federal inaction, these raises are indexed to inflation, so they match the cost of living,\" NELP researcher Tsedeye Gebreselassie told CBS News.",
      "She noted that several increases have been driven by worker-led organizing, kicked off by the Fight for $15, a national movement for better pay and working conditions, which began in 2012.",
      "Some localities continue to have a $7.25 minimum wage. Many of them are in southern U.S. states.",
      "\"The contrast between states and cities that are raising wages every year and those that are stuck at $7.25 is really jarring,\" Gebreselassie said. \"On the one hand, the lack of affordability is about things costing too much, but on the other hand, it means people are not earning enough money to buy things.\"",
      "She added, \"There is a lot of talk about the former, but we need to make sure we are not losing sight of the fact that workers' wages need to go up.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 20:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has recently attacked Gov. Tim Walz over the fraud cases, calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and lashing out against the state's Somali community.",
    "story": [
      "A series of multimillion-dollar alleged fraud schemes in Minnesota has drawn the Trump administration's attention in recent weeks, vaulting an issue that has brewed in state politics for years into the national conversation.",
      "President Trump has called Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" and has lashed out against the state's Somali community as most of the fraud defendants were of Somali descent \u2014 drawing stiff criticism from local officials. This week, the administration launched enhanced immigration operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. House Republicans launched an investigation Wednesday into Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the fraud cases, and the U.S. Treasury said Monday it will look into whether tax dollars from Minnesota made their way to al Shabaab, a Somali-based al Qaeda affiliate. And federal prosecutors have continued to bring new charges against alleged fraudsters in the Midwestern state in recent months.",
      "Here's what to know about the cases:",
      "What was the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme?",
      "Three years ago, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed the first charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\"",
      "The $250 million scheme \u2014 which now includes upward of 75 defendants \u2014 revolved around a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, prosecutors say, Feeding Our Future and its affiliated food distribution sites submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices to trick state and federal officials into thinking they had helped serve food to thousands of children. The group allegedly raked in millions in administrative fees for the fake meal distributions, and got kickbacks from people who ran their distribution sites, according to federal charging documents.",
      "Feeding Our Future's founder, Aimee Bock, was convicted at trial earlier this year. Several other defendants, including distribution site operators, have pleaded guilty or been convicted, in some cases receiving multiyear prison sentences and being ordered to pay millions in restitution. One defendant also pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe a juror, after a member of the jury in his fraud trial found a bag with $120,000 in cash at her home.",
      "Bock has long denied wrongdoing. At various points before charges were filed, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of distribution sites, leading Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of discrimination.",
      "The case was part of a trend of large-scale fraud across the U.S. during the pandemic, as the federal government poured money into assistance programs at a rapid clip. One former federal watchdog estimated to \"60 Minutes\" earlier this year that COVID-19 fraud may have cost taxpayers some $1 trillion.",
      "Prosecutors said the program that was allegedly co-opted by Feeding Our Future \u2014 the Federal Child Nutrition Program \u2014 became more vulnerable to fraud due to changes during the pandemic. Oversight was more difficult because of the health crisis, and federal officials waived some of the program's rules to let restaurants participate and allow off-site meal distribution.",
      "State officials have faced scrutiny for their handling of the situation. A probe last year by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor found the Minnesota Department of Education \"created opportunities for fraud\" by failing to act on warning signs with Feeding Our Future or investigate complaints about the group.",
      "The report also found that officials felt they needed to handle Feeding Our Future carefully because the group had responded to a 2020 slowdown in food site approvals by accusing the Minnesota Department of Education of racial discrimination and of depriving needy children of food. In the Feeding Our Future's lawsuit against the state, it noted that it \"caters to members of a protected group of racial minorities and foreign nationals.\"",
      "The auditor's office said \"the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention affected MDE's decisions about the regulatory actions it did and did not take against Feeding Our Future.\"",
      "What other fraud allegations have circulated in Minnesota?",
      "The Feeding Our Future scheme isn't the only fraud case to rattle Minnesota politics.",
      "In August, state officials shut down a fairly new program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities find housing after discovering \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "A month later, federal prosecutors charged eight people with allegedly defrauding the program, which was run through the state's Medicaid service, by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the housing stabilization program was susceptible to fraud because it intentionally had \"low barriers to entry\" and few recordkeeping requirements. They also noted that spending on the program had ballooned to more than $100 million last year, despite initial estimates that it would cost around $2.6 million a year.",
      "And in late September, a person was charged with defrauding a third state program \u2014 in this case, one that provides services to children with autism. Her company was accused of hiring unqualified \"behavioral technicians\" and submitting false claims to the state that indicated the staff had worked with children enrolled in the program.",
      "She also allegedly paid kickbacks to parents who agreed to enroll their children in the program, in some cases sending them as much as $1,500, prosecutors said.",
      "The same person, Asha Farhan Hassan, was also charged in September with running a fraudulent food distribution site as part of the Feeding Our Future scheme.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said the case \"is not an isolated scheme.\"",
      "\"From Feeding Our Future to Housing Stabilization Services and now Autism Services, these massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money,\" the federal prosecutor wrote in a statement.",
      "Kelly Loeffler, who leads the U.S. Small Business Administration, also alleged Tuesday that some of the groups linked to the Feeding Our Future scheme received COVID-era emergency loans. She said she has ordered an \"investigation into the network of Somali organizations and executives implicated in these schemes.\" She did not provide details on the probe.",
      "What is the connection to Minnesota's Somali community?",
      "Most of the people charged in the Feeding Our Future case are of Somali descent, though Bock, the group's founder and the scheme's alleged \"mastermind,\" is White.",
      "Prosecutors in the alleged autism services fraud scheme said the defendant \"approached parents in the Somali community to recruit their children.\"",
      "The named fraud defendants appear to represent a small percentage of Minnesota's Somali American community, which is among the largest in the nation.",
      "Some 76,000 people of Somali descent live in the state, more than half of whom were born in the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures from last year. The vast majority of the state's foreign-born Somali population has U.S. citizenship, and most entered the U.S. before 2010.",
      "Around 65% of Somali people in Minnesota ages 16 and over were employed as of last year, according to the Census Bureau, roughly equivalent to the state population as a whole.",
      "Last year, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office, Kayseh Magan, wrote about what he called an \"uncomfortable and true\" reality that many people who have been charged with fraud in the state are of Somali descent.",
      "He wrote that \"fraud occurs when desire meets opportunity,\" noting that many Somali Americans are \"poor, desperate and seek shortcuts,\" and their families in the impoverished East African country frequently rely on money from their U.S.-based relatives. He said Somali service providers often leverage trust within the community to recruit friends and relatives into their programs. Many victims of these fraud schemes are Somali, too, he added.",
      "Has Minnesota taxpayer money made its way to the terror group al Shabaab?",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that his department will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia.",
      "Bessent appeared to be responding to a report in the conservative magazine City Journal that alleged millions from state programs \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources.",
      "Those allegations have circulated for years. A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that Child Care Assistance Program funding is going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have been sent overseas and eventually found their way to terrorists.",
      "Multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "Andy Lugar, a Biden- and Obama-era U.S. attorney for Minnesota, told The Minnesota Star Tribune last month that those charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme \"were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.\"",
      "What has President Trump said?",
      "Mr. Trump has blamed the fraud schemes on Somali people, whom he has attacked in often incendiary terms in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the president called immigrants from Somalia \"garbage,\" and claimed they \"destroyed Minnesota\" and \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "Last month, the president announced he would end temporary deportation protections for Somali immigrants who live in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State,\" and that Minnesota has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"",
      "Somalia is also one of 19 countries that have faced near-total travel bans and a halt to immigration applications. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations are underway this week in the Minneapolis area, CBS News has reported.",
      "A particular focus of Mr. Trump's ire is Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager. He has also lashed out at Walz, whom he referred to last week using a slur for people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "Minnesota lawmakers and members of the state's Somali community have castigated Mr. Trump for the comments. In an interview with \"Meet The Press\" last weekend, Walz said the fraud issue \"is totally disconnected with demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better.\"",
      "What has Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said about the fraud schemes?",
      "Walz, who has served as Minnesota's governor since 2019, told NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that his state has sought to crack down on fraud. He also pointed to the state's generosity.",
      "\"Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We're AAA-bond rated,\" said the governor and 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee. \"But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We're doing everything we can.\"",
      "Asked this week about the U.S. Treasury's investigation into claims that tax money may have gone to al Shabaab, Walz said the state welcomes federal help and wants to crack down on fraud, but added: \"I don't think anybody in here really believes their motive and their timing,\" referring to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, the governor and his administration have faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud, dating back to the Feeding Our Future scheme's emergence in 2022. Republican officials have long argued the state failed to carry out due diligence and was slow to act in that scheme \u2014 though Walz has insisted the state caught the fraud early but was stymied by court battles and asked by the FBI not to cut off payments during its investigation.",
      "That scrutiny has resurged in recent weeks. Earlier Wednesday, Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs.",
      "\"The Committee has serious concerns about how you as the Governor, and the Democrat-controlled administration, allowed millions of dollars to be stolen,\" Comer said in a letter requesting documents from Walz. \"The Committee also has concerns that you and your administration were fully aware of this fraud and chose not to act for fear of political retaliation.\"",

      "A mass shooting carried out Saturday by multiple suspects in an unlicensed bar near the South African capital left at least 11 people dead, police said, including three children.",
      "The children killed were a 3-year-old boy, a 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl, the South African Police Services\u00a0said on social media. They did not give the ages of the other victims. Police said they were searching for three male suspects.",
      "Another 14 people were wounded and taken to the hospital, according to the SAPS statement. Police didn't give details on the ages of those who were injured or their conditions.",
      "The shooting happened at an illegal bar inside a hostel in the Saulsville township, west of the administrative capital of Pretoria, in the early hours of Saturday. Ten of the victims died at the scene and the 11th died at the hospital, police said.",
      "\"We are told that at least three unknown gunmen entered this hostel where a group of people were drinking and they started randomly shooting,\" police spokesperson Brig. Athlenda Mathe told national broadcaster SABC. She said the motive for the killings was not clear. The shootings happened at around 4.15 a.m., she said, but police were only alerted at 6 a.m.",
      "South Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and recorded more than 26,000 homicides in 2024 \u2014 an average of more than 70 a day. Firearms are by far the leading cause of death in homicides.",
      "The country of 62 million people has relatively strict gun ownership laws, but many killings are committed with illegal guns, authorities say.",
      "There have been several mass shootings at bars \u2014 sometimes called shebeens or taverns in South Africa \u2014 in recent years, including one that left eight people dead in the southeast city of Durban just a few months ago. In September 2024, 17 people were killed in two incidents in the same rural town. A bar shooting in Johannesburg's Soweto township left 16 people dead in 2022.",
      "Mathe said that mass shootings at unlicensed bars were becoming a serious problem and police had shut down more than 11,000 illegal taverns between April and September this year and arrested more than 18,000 people for involvement in illegal liquor sales.",

      "Video of the stunt at the Tower of London, once a royal palace also known as the prison where Anne Boleyn, Thomas More and others were executed, showed two protesters attacking the case as other visitors stepped back in shock.

      "The Metropolitan Police said the protesters were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. The Tower of London was subsequently closed on Saturday.",

      "\"Our country is crumbling before our eyes,\" said Ali, a student from London, in a statement shared by the group. \"We have homeless people dying on the very streets that King Charles passed on his way to the coronation, whilst there are more empty homes than unhoused people in this country.\"",
      "Many prized treasures and artworks have been targeted in attempts to draw attention to political causes.

      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",
      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris' representatives. Harris has not publicly commented on his arrest.",
      "CBS News reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Japan for additional comment.",
      "Japanese criminal procedures allow investigators to keep a suspect in custody for up to 23 days before indictment, and pretrial detention can be prolonged if the accused exercises their right of silence or denies the charges, a practice widely criticized as \"hostage justice.\"",
      "Those convicted of drug smuggling in Japan can face a multiyear prison term.",
      "Harris burst onto the arts scene with \"Slave Play,\" written while he was still a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama. It premiered off-Broadway in 2018, inciting controversy and even a petition to shut down the production with its provocative mix of race, class and sexual taboos. It moved to Broadway the following year, earning a Tony nomination for best play, but did not win an award.",
      "The play returned for a short run on Broadway in December 2021.",
      "\"There haven't been enough chances for us to reflect who we are to the world and to ourselves and to ponder what that reflection means, and so this is what 'Slave Play' gets to do for people,\" Harris told CBS New York in 2021.",

      "Emergency crews raced against time on Friday after last week's catastrophic floods and landslides that struck parts of Asia, killing more than 1,500 people. Relief operations were underway, but the scale of need overwhelmed the capabilities of rescuers.",
      "More than 900 people have died in Indonesia, the country's disaster management agency said Saturday, according to the AFP. The death toll stood at 908, with 410 people still reported missing.",
      "Authorities said there were 486 people were confirmed dead in Sri Lanka, and 185 in Thailand. There were three deaths confirmed in Malaysia.",
      "Many villages in Indonesia and Sri Lanka remained buried under mud and debris, with nearly 900 people still unaccounted for in both countries, while recovery was further along in Thailand and Malaysia.",
      "As the waters recede, survivors find the disaster has crippled their villages' lifelines. Roads that once connected the cities and districts to the outside world are severed, leaving some areas accessible only by helicopter. Transmission towers collapsed under the weight of landslides, plunging communities into darkness and causing internet outages.",
      "Survivors plead for urgent aid amid widespread devastation",
      "In Aceh Tamiang, the hardest-hit area in Indonesia's Aceh province, infrastructure is in ruins. Entire villages in the lush hills district lie submerged beneath a thick blanket of mud. More than 260,000 residents fled homes once on green farmland. For many, survival hinges on the speed of aid as clean water, sanitation and shelter top the list of urgent priorities.",
      "Trucks carrying relief supplies crawl along roads connecting North Sumatra's Medan city to Aceh Tamiang, which reopened almost a week after the disaster, but distribution is slowed by debris on the roads, said the National Disaster Management Agency's spokesperson Abdul Muhari.",
      "An Associated Press photojournalist described widespread devastation in Aceh Tamiang after flash floods tore through the area, with cars overturned and homes badly damaged. Animal carcasses are scattered among the debris. Many residents are still haunted by the 2004 tsunami that devastated Aceh and killed around 230,000 people globally, with 160,000 in Aceh alone.",
      "On a battered bridge spanning the swollen Tamiang River, families found shelter under makeshift tents of bed sheets and torn fabric.",
      "A survivor there, Ibrahim bin Usman, cradled his grandsons on the muddy ground where his home once stood. He recounted how floodwaters full of logs hit his house and the houses of his children and his siblings, forcing his family of 21, including babies, to cling to the roof of a warehouse before being evacuated by a small wooden boat by fellow villagers.",
      "\"Six houses in my family were swept away,\" he said. \"This wasn't a flood \u2014 it was a tsunami from the hills. Many bodies are still buried under mud.\"",
      "Residents drink muddy floodwater that destroyed their homes",
      "With wells contaminated and pipes shattered, the floodwaters have turned necessities into luxuries.",
      "Resident Mariana, who goes by a single name like many Indonesians, broke down in tears when recalling how she survived as water surged into her village on Nov. 27. \"The water kept rising, forcing us to flee. Even at higher ground, it didn't stop. We panicked.\"",
      "The 53-year-old widow said she and others eventually reached a two-story school, but survival was grim: there was no food or clean water. \"We drank floodwaters after letting it settle and boiling it. Children drank it too,\" said Mariana, whose home was flattened.",
      "A clothing trader in the village of Kampung Dalam, Joko Sofyan, said residents had no choice but to drink the same water that destroyed their homes as they waited for aid, causing children to fall ill.",
      "\"My house is just rubble now,\" said Sofyan, a father of two. \"We need food, medicine, and clean water urgently.\"",
      "Survivor blames deforestation, corruption",
      "While some relief has trickled in, survivors say they need household equipment to cook food.",
      "Frustration is mounting: \"Why isn't there a public kitchen? We have nothing left,\" shouted Hadi Akher to the crowd as rescue workers struggled to maintain order among long lines of hungry villagers near a truck full of aid supplies.",
      "Akher, who was bare-chested like most men in flood-hit areas due to lack of clothing, blamed deforestation for worsening the disaster, accusing local officials of corruption.",

      "The flattering comments about Kushner by the senior Russian official come as Putin has sought to sow division between Mr. Trump and Ukraine and Europe at a moment when Mr. Trump's impatience with the conflict is mounting. Putin, who made a state visit to India on Thursday, told an Indian media outlet that his five-hour talks this week with Witkoff and Kushner were \"necessary\" and \"useful,\" but some proposals were unacceptable.",

      "\"I ran out to tell my colleagues and the officials. After that it was a real struggle. It was the day before the weekend \u2014 normally, we stop at 2 pm. We thought: 'This is not possible.'\"",
      "The team then set up lights to work through the night. It took 10 days to carefully extract all of the 225 small green figurines.",
      "They were \"carefully arranged in a star shape around the sides of a trapezoidal pit and in horizontal rows at the bottom,\" Payraudeau said.",
      "The funerary figurines, which are known as ushabti, were intended as servants to accompany the dead into the afterlife.",
      "More than half the figurines are women, which is \"quite exceptional,\" Payraudeau said.",
      "Located in the Nile Delta, Tanis was founded around 1050 BC as the capital of the Egyptian kingdom during the 21st dynasty.",
      "At the time, the Valley of the Kings \u2014 which had been looted during the reign of pharaohs including Ramses \u2014 was abandoned and the royal necropolis was moved to Tanis, Payraudeau said.",
      "\"Many secrets that have not yet been discovered\"",
      "The royal symbol on the newly discovered figurines also solves a long-standing mystery by identifying who was buried in the sarcophagus. It was pharaoh Shoshenq III, who reigned from 830 to 791 BC.",
      "This was \"astonishing\" because the walls of a different tomb at the site \u2014 and the largest sarcophagus there -- bear his name, Payraudeau said.",
      "\"Why isn't he buried in this tomb?\" the expert asked.",
      "\"Obviously, for a pharaoh, building a tomb is a gamble because you can never be sure your successor will bury you there,\" he said.",
      "\"Clearly, we have new proof that these gambles are not always successful,\" Payraudeau said with a smile.",
      "Shoshenq III's four-decade reign was turbulent, marred by a \"very bloody civil war between upper and lower Egypt, with several pharaohs fighting for power,\" he said.",
      "So it is possible that the royal succession did not go as planned and the pharaoh was not buried in his chosen tomb. Another possibility is that his remains were moved later due to looting.",
      "But it is \"difficult to imagine that a 3.5-by-1.5-meter granite sarcophagus could have been reinstalled in such a small place,\" Payraudeau said.",
      "After the figurines are studied, they will be displayed in an Egyptian museum, Payraudeau said.",
      "Experts in Egypt confirmed the discovery marked \"a decisive step in solving a long-standing archaeological mystery,\" the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a Facebook post.",
      "In the Facebook post, Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Archaeological, said the discovery \"confirms that the Tanis site still holds many secrets that have not yet been discovered.\"",
      "Mr. Mohamed Abdel-Badii, head of the Egyptian Archeological Sector, pointed out that the mission also revealed previously unknown patterns within the chamber itself, shedding light on burial methods during that period.",
      "\"It is still unclear whether the king was buried directly inside the tomb of Osarkon II, or if his funeral collectors were moved to this location to protect it from theft,\" the ministry said in its Facebook post. \"We still have a lot of work to answer these questions.\"",
      "The discovery was announced just weeks after the official opening ceremony for the $1 billion Grand Egyptian Museum. The GEM is one of the largest museums in the world, and the largest dedicated to a single civilization: ancient Egypt. Its subject matter spans some 7,000 years, from prehistory to the end of the Greek and Roman eras around 400 A.D.",

      "European Union regulators on Friday said it is fining Elon Musk's social media platform X $140 million (120 million euros) for violating regulations aimed at protecting internet users in the trading bloc from digital abuses.",
      "The European Commission said that X breached \"transparency obligations\" under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The fine represents the EU's first move to sanction a company for violating the law since the law was enacted in 2022.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the commission accused X of using its 'blue checkmark' in a way that deceives users. Anyone can pay to get the verification, making it hard for users to judge the authenticity of the accounts they engage with on the social media platform, the EU said. This could expose users to scams and \"other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" the commission noted.",
      "The European Commission also took aim at X's ads repository, which it said fails to meet accessibility requirements under the DSA. Internet platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience. That goal is to help researchers detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns.",
      "X has 60 days to tell the European Commission how it plans to address the group's concerns.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr took issue with the fine and defended X. \"Once again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\" he\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0Friday in a post shared by X owner Elon Musk.",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "After a number of drone sightings near European airports and military bases, mysterious aircraft were seen over Ireland as Ukraine's Zelenskyy visited.",
    "story": [
      "Unidentified drones breached Ireland's airspace this week during a visit by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"Any incident like this would be well under control by defense forces,\" the source told CBS News, adding: \"You see these across Europe now.\"",
      "The Irish Department of Defense told CBS News in a statement Friday that \"all of the circumstances regarding the incident\" are being investigated and analyzed by Irish military and police officials.",
      "The drones were large and likely of military specification, and the incident was classed as a hybrid attack by Irish officials, according to the Irish news outlet The Journal, which cited security services in the country. Senior Irish government officials\u00a0 were briefed following the presence of drones, according to the Irish state broadcaster RT\u00c9.",
      "It comes after weeks of reports from other European nations of unidentified drones flying around key infrastructure, including\u00a0airports and military facilities in Germany, Denmark and the Baltic states. The incidents have forced airports to suspend flights many times in recent months, and unmarked drone aircraft have even been spotted around military bases, including near a\u00a0Belgian military base\u00a0where U.S. nuclear weapons are stored last month.",
      "Some of the United States' European NATO allies have alleged these airspace incursions are part of a campaign of\u00a0escalating hybrid warfare tactics by Russia.",
      "The Journal reported Thursday that four unidentified military-style drones had breached an Irish no-fly zone and flown toward the flight path of Zelenskyy's plane while it was still over the sea approaching Dublin Airport late Monday evening. The drones reached the location where Zelenskyy's plane was expected to be at the exact moment it had been due to pass, according to the outlet.",
      "The Ukrainian leader's plane landed, reportedly slightly ahead of schedule, just moments before the incident happened around 11 p.m. local time. The drones then circled over an Irish Navy vessel that was deployed in the Irish Sea specifically for the Zelenskyy visit after the incident, The Journal said.",
      "Zelenskyy made a diplomatic visit to Ireland this week, meeting with the country's Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin and addressing Ireland's parliament.",
      "The Irish military declined to comment on the specifics of the incident but told CBS News Friday that a security operation in partnership with Irish police, \"was successfully deployed in multiple means ultimately leading to a safe and successful visit by the President Zelensky to Ireland.\"",

      "The Trump administration claims in its new National Security Strategy, published early Friday morning, that some of America's oldest allies in Europe face \"the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\" due to immigration and the purported erosion of democratic principles.",
      "Accusing the European Union and other unnamed transnational bodies of allowing unchecked immigration and curbing free speech, the document claims that, \"should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,\" and that \"it is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies\" to the United States.",
      "The document claims Europe suffers from a \"lack of self-confidence\" that \"is most evident in Europe's relationship with Russia.\"",
      "It says that European countries have a \"significant hard power advantage\" over Russia, but because of Russia's war in Ukraine, they now \"regard Russia as an existential threat.\"",
      "President Trump recently proposed a plan to end the brutal war sparked by Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was drafted without Ukrainian or European involvement and largely reflected Russian demands.",
      "The plan drew a careful diplomatic response from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and from America's NATO allies, which have been trying to show a united front and continue supporting Kyiv's defensive efforts.",
      "The National Security Strategy attacks the positions of some European governments on Ukraine, accusing unspecified officials of holding \"unrealistic expectations for the war\" as they lead \"unstable minority governments\" in their own countries.",
      "The White House strategy makes the unsubstantiated claim that the populations of some European countries want an end to the war, but that their governments are subverting democratic processes and not delivering it.",
      "The document says \"it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European. As such, it is an open question whether they will view their place in the world, or their alliance with the United States, in the same way as those who signed the NATO charter.\"",
      "Some of the sentiments in the strategy document, particularly on the purported erosion of free speech rights in Europe, echo remarks delivered by Vice President JD Vance at a security conference in Germany early this year. He berated European leaders and accused some American allies of politically censoring right-wing ideas within their own nations.",
      "The 33-page document breaks down American foreign policy for five broad regions: the Western Hemisphere, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.",
      "The strategy notes the reestablishment of strategic stability with Russia, enabling Europe to take primary responsibility for its own defense, and \"ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a perpetually expanding alliance\" among other U.S. priorities.",
      "The document does say Europe remains \"strategically and culturally vital to the United States,\" and that America's \"goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 07:29:19 -0500",
    "summary": "As the White House tries to curb Moscow's energy income, Vladimir Putin enjoys a warm welcome in India, and promises an \"uninterrupted supply\" of Russian fuel.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday at an annual summit and agreed to diversify mutual economic ties, as the United States presses India to revise its decades-old partnership with Russia.",
      "The 23rd Russia-India Summit comes at a pivotal moment as the U.S. pushes for a Ukraine peace deal while seeking global cooperation. It will test New Delhi's efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the nearly four-year war in Ukraine grinds on.",
      "Putin was received by Modi at an airport in New Delhi on Thursday. The Indian leader gave Putin a bear hug and a tight handshake with the gusto of an old friend.",
      "After the talks, Putin and Modi announced that India and Russia have finalized an economic cooperation program until 2030, which will help diversify mutual businesses to boost annual trade to $100 billion by 2030. They also emphasized strong energy ties.",
      "Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $68.7 billion in the last fiscal year ended March. The trade is heavily skewed in favor of Russia with deep deficits for India, which it is looking to bridge by pushing exports.",
      "\"To achieve this significant goal, a program for the development of Russian-Indian economic cooperation until 2030 has been agreed upon,\" Putin said. He said work is underway on an agreement for India to establish a free trade zone with the Eurasian Economic Union, a Moscow-dominated economic grouping of several ex-Soviet nations, adding that it could help increase trade.",
      "\"Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources and everything necessary for the development of India's energy sector,\" Putin said. \"We are ready to continue ensuring the uninterrupted supply of fuel for the rapidly growing Indian economy.\"",
      "Before the summit talks, the Russian leader said the two countries \"have a very trusting relationship when it comes to military-technical cooperation.\"",
      "Modi, for his part, said after the talks that the two countries will work toward early conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. He also announced that India will soon start issuing free electronic visas for Russian tourists and groups visiting the country.",
      "The Indian leader said energy security has long anchored India-Russia ties, with civil nuclear cooperation spanning decades. He added that such cooperation will continue, alongside collaboration in clean energy, shipbuilding, fertilizers and labor mobility.",
      "While India has historically maintained deep ties with Russia, critics say Putin's visit could strain relations with the European Union and the United States and might jeopardize negotiations for major trade agreements with both that are seen as critical for India's exports.",
      "President Trump raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50% in August, citing New Delhi's discounted Russian oil. India has been the second biggest importer of Russian crude after China.",
      "India's \"strategic tightrope walk\" between Russia and the West",
      "The U.S. says purchases of Russian oil help finance Moscow's war machine. In October, the U.S. sanctioned two of Moscow's biggest oil producers to force countries like India to cut down on imports. Indian officials have said New Delhi has always abided by international sanctions and would do so in the case of Russia oil purchases as well.",
      "The sanctions announced in October targeting Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft were the first direct actions against Russia by the U.S. Treasury since Mr. Trump took office for his second term. The Treasury said about a month later that they were having the desired impact, with nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil coming forward to say they would pause purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December.",
      "India and the U.S. set a target for the first tranche of a trade deal by the fall, but the deal hasn't come through yet amid strains in relations. The Trump administration has for months tied the imposition of steep tariffs on Indian imports directly to the country's ongoing purchases of Russian energy.",

      "How Russia works around sanctions designed to cripple its war-time economy",
      "India is also in the final stages of talks on a trade agreement with the EU, which sees Russia's war in Ukraine as a major threat.",
      "Putin's India visit, \"given the timing and geopolitical context, underscores New Delhi's strategic tightrope walk between the West and the rest, chiefly Russia,\" said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group.",
      "Donthi said India's tilt toward Russia dates back to the Cold War and persists despite its official nonaligned position. \"The significant change now is its desire to be a strategic partner with the U.S. at the same time, which will be a diplomatic challenge,\" he added.",
      "Indian officials earlier said that Modi in the meeting with Putin would push for faster delivery of two further Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. It has already received three under a 2018 deal worth about $5.4 billion. The delay has been tied to supply chain disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine.",
      "The two sides signed a pact in February to improve military cooperation, exercises, port calls, disaster relief assistance and logistics support. Moscow's State Duma ratified the same ahead of Putin's India visit.",
      "India is also expecting to upgrade its Russian-made Su-30MKI fighter jets and accelerate deliveries of critical military hardware.",
      "India is keen to increase exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture and textiles to Russia and is seeking the removal of non-tariff barriers. New Delhi is also seeking long-term supplies of fertilizers from Moscow.",
      "Another key area where the two countries hope to finalize an agreement is the safety and regulation of migration of Indian skilled workers to Russia.",
      "Putin last visited India in 2021. Modi was in Moscow last year, and the two leaders briefly met in September in China during a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.",

    "summary": "The facility teaches both civilians and military personnel the skills to fly drones and hit targets.",
    "story": [
      "In a disused warehouse at an undisclosed location in Ukraine, a military drone instructor who goes by the call sign \"DC\" showed CBS News a makeshift practice course that students must learn to fly the increasingly indispensable devices through before they join the country's defense against Russia.",
      "The trainees have to master the operation of the small but mighty First-Person-View (FPV) drones, which have become a signature weapon in the ongoing war sparked by Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion.",
      "\"In the battlefield, all you have to do is travel the biggest distance possible and fly, with such bad signal that your eyes will bleed,\" DC said calmly as he flew a practice drone around the course at the Killhouse Academy.",
      "Both civilians and military personnel learn at the academy to pilot FPV drones, and to use them as lethal weapons, through both computer simulations and practical flight and target practice using real drones.",
      "Practice and patience are essential, said DC, who is one of the men in charge of training Ukraine's next generation of defenders.",
      "\"You have to be calm, you cannot see a target and, for example, rush to it like a bull. You have to be able to be thinking\u00a0 and watching and detecting your target,\" DC said, \"it's the hardest part of the job.\"",
      "Despite their small size, the drones represent a major development in modern warfare. Once equipped with an explosive charge, they can be quickly flown to distant targets by remote operators piloting via a live feed from a camera mounted on the weapons.",
      "\"To save lives, to save money and time, you have to become unmanned. Because if you use manpower, it will only get you so far,\" said DC.",
      "The widespread use of cheaper, expendable drones in the nearly four-year-long war in Ukraine has been watched closely by the U.S. military. On June 6, President Trump signed the \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" executive order, seeking to shore up domestic production of cheap, lethal drones.",
      "The Pentagon has recently announced its intention to purchase 200,000 drones with lethal capabilities by 2027, as part of what it calls the Drone Dominance Program.",
      "For both Ukrainian and Russian troops on the battlefield, drones are already very much a reality, accounting for about 80% of military casualties in Ukraine, according to some estimates. They have revolutionized warfare, and given Ukraine a way to try to level the playing field against Russia, which has vastly more soldiers to throw at the front lines.",
      "\"If you want to survive, you will find the best solution,\" DC told CBS News.",
      "He said he was unsure how many Russian soldiers he'd killed on the battlefield, but his focus now is on training others to compete with Russia's drone operators. He compared it to an arms race.",
      "\"Only those survive who adapt. Adaptability is key,\" he said. \"It's a constant race for us and for them, to find an upper hand over the enemy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Military officials showed lawmakers video of a second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat behind closed doors on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and testified that there was no order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to kill everyone on board, multiple lawmakers said.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, head of Special Operations Command, briefed the leaders of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees for both the House and the Senate. The classified briefings centered on the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of South America, including the\u00a0Sept. 2 follow-on strike\u00a0that has become a flashpoint in Congress.",
      "The Pentagon has been under fire since the Washington Post reported that a second missile killed two survivors of the initial strike. Hegseth has said the decision to strike the boat again was made by Bradley, who was leading the mission. The survivors were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, spoke with reporters after the briefings. They both said Bradley told them that he had not been ordered to leave no survivors. The\u00a0initial Post report\u00a0quoted an anonymous source as saying that, before the first strike, Hegseth verbally ordered that everyone on the boat be taken out. \"The order was to kill everybody,\" the Post's story quoted the source as saying. Hegseth has denied the Post's account.",
      "The lawmakers also said they were shown the video of the second attack, which has not been made public. Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after the briefing that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"",
      "\"You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who are killed by the United States,\" Himes said.",
      "\"Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors \u2014 bad guys, bad guys \u2014 but attacking shipwrecked sailors,\" Himes added. \"Now there's a whole set of contextual items that the admiral explained \u2014 yes, they were carrying drugs. They were not in the position to continue their mission in any way. People will someday see this video, and they will see that that video shows, if you don't have the broader context, an attack on shipwrecked sailors.\"",
      "President Trump said Wednesday that he would support releasing the footage.",
      "Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, refuted Himes' characterization of the video after his briefing, saying he \"didn't see anything disturbing about it.\"",
      "Cotton said the four strikes on Sept. 2 were \"entirely lawful and needful, and they were exactly what we'd expect our military commanders to do.\"",
      "\"I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight, and potentially, given all the context we've heard of other narco-terrorist boats in the area coming to their aid to recover the cargo and recover those narco-terrorists,\" Cotton said.",
      "Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Defense subcommittee and was also briefed, told reporters, \"I think it'd be hard to watch this series of videos and not be troubled,\" and said he has \"more policy questions than ever\" about the mission.",
      "Coons said there were certain aspects of the briefing that he found more reassuring concerning process and intelligence, but \"more broadly, what we are asking the men and women of our armed forces, and particularly the special forces, to do, I think still lacks clear justification.\"",
      "\"The underlying judgment that frames this entire operation is that if there is a boat with narcotics and people who are affiliated with a narcotics trafficking organization, that that's a legitimate target,\" Coons said. \"I've still got questions about that.\"",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that he was \"deeply disturbed by what I saw this morning,\" and called for the Pentagon to release the footage of the second strike.",
      "\"This briefing confirmed my worst fears about the nature of the Trump Administration's military activities, and demonstrates exactly why the Senate Armed Services Committee has repeatedly requested\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and been denied\u00a0\u2014\u00a0fundamental information, documents, and facts about this operation. This must and will be the only beginning of our investigation into this incident.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also called the video \"very disturbing\" and said all members of Congress should see it. But Warner declined to weigh in on the legality or morality of it.",
      "GOP Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement after the briefings that there is \"no doubt in my mind about the highly professional manner in which the Department of War conducted, and is conducting the operations our nation has called them to do to protect the homeland.\"",
      "\"I am deeply concerned by the public statements made by others that seek to ignore the realities of targeting terrorists to score political points,\" he added.",
      "The strike has sparked bipartisan concern from lawmakers and vows to investigate. Though the administration has argued the follow-on strike was legal and justified, members of Congress and experts have questioned its legality, with accusations from some Democrats that it would constitute a war crime if the second strike targeted survivors.",
      "The strike was the first of the administration's campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Southern Hemisphere, which has now grown to more than 20 strikes and killed more than 80 people. The attacks attracted scrutiny from lawmakers even before the Post's report, since the administration is conducting them without authorization from Congress. The administration has argued it has the legal authority to conduct the strikes because it has designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations and U.S. troops are not in harm's way.",

    "story": [
      "When the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier lost an F-18 fighter jet in May because of an arresting wire failure, the crew was in the midst of \"significantly stressful deployment\"\u00a0 because of operations against the Houthis in Yemen, according to a Navy investigation report released Thursday.",
      "The Navy said in a statement Thursday that investigations into a series of accidents involving the Truman carrier strike group \"reviewed how a Carrier Strike Group prepares for and responds to adversity during combat operations.\"",
      "From March 15 to May 6, the Truman participated in \"Operation Rough Rider,\" which targeted the Houthis who were attacking merchant ships and U.S. Navy ships.",
      "During this period, aircraft flew for 52 days, including 72 hours of continuous flight operations. Flight crews conducted more than 1,000 air strikes against the Houthis with more than one million pounds of ordnance.",
      "Over the course of its full deployment from September 2024 through May 2025, the carrier strike group had a friendly fire incident in December \u2014 when a Navy destroyer launched missiles at two F-18s \u2014 a collision with a merchant ship in February and lost two F-18s, one in April and another in May.",
      "\"The Navy is committed to being a learning organization,\" Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jim Kilby said in a statement. \"These investigations reinforce the need to continue investing in our people to ensure we deliver battle-ready forces to operational commanders.\"",
      "Kilby told reporters that \"appropriate accountability actions have been taken,\" but the investigations redacted the sections about what those actions were and whether they were taken during or after the deployment.",
      "The investigations found a multitude of factors were to blame for each incident, but overall, the recommendations in the investigations include service members better adhering to Navy processes, especially in a combat environment.",
      "\"All of these mishaps were avoidable, whether they were combat related or not,\" according to a Navy official who spoke with reporters ahead of the release of the investigations.",
      "No service members were killed as a result of the four incidents, but there were close calls. In the friendly fire incident, the crew members of one of the F-18 fighter jets targeted in error saw the missile from the USS Gettysburg pass \"one to two plane lengths\" behind them, according to the investigation. The crew of the other F-18 ejected as the missile approached and were rescued by helicopter.",
      "During the February collision near the Suez Canal, about eight personnel were working approximately 10 feet away from the area of impact. The investigation notes that if the collision had occurred about 100 feet forward, it would've struck an area of the aircraft carrier where 120 sailors were sleeping.",
      "All of the incidents combined cost the Navy about $164 million, according to figures released in the investigations, combined with the estimated cost of an F-18 aircraft.",
      "When the USS Gettysburg destroyer fired two missiles at aircraft flying back to the Truman, one crew ejected, leaving the estimated $67 million F-18 jet behind. After the February collision, temporarily fixing the impacts carried a price tag of about $685,000, with a full repair expected post-deployment.",
      "The investigations into the two F-18 losses in April and May found the estimated cost was $36,141,169 and $60,259,238, respectively, including the cost of other damaged equipment.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Details about the strikes on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2 have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved more than one strike, including one that killed survivors of the initial attack.",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The new details about the strike on Sept. 2 have now led some lawmakers to openly question whether the attack on the survivors was a war crime.",
      "Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, the commander who oversaw the Sept. 2 operation,\u00a0briefed small groups of lawmakers on the strikes on Thursday.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters after the classified briefings that Bradley said he had not been ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \"kill everybody,\" as was\u00a0reported\u00a0last week by the Washington Post.",
      "But Himes added that the lawmakers were shown video of the second strike, and said that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\" Cotton defended the attack, saying he \"saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight.\"",
      "As lawmakers continue to pursue the facts of what occurred on Sept. 2, doubts about the legality of the ongoing campaign against the alleged drug boats persist, with experts and former officials saying the strikes were shaky ground even before the latest revelations.",
      "The boat strikes",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" President Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "Analysis from The Free Press:\u00a0Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an \"expeditious declassification\" of the legal opinion in\u00a0a letter\u00a0last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,\" they wrote. \"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.\"",
      "Consent from Congress",
      "Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.",
      "In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.",
      "The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\"",
      "The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.\" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.",
      "But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services Committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.",
      "\"Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,\" says former military prosecutor",
      "The Trump administration's claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "\"There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,\" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.",
      "Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.",
      "\"They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,\" Finucane said.",
      "Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.",
      "\"There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,\" Hansen said.",
      "Trump \"wants it both ways,\" expert says",
      "The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an \"armed conflict\" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.",
      "If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the intentional killing of survivors may have.",
      "The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\"",
      "The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, \"it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter.\" The rule applies \"during non-international armed conflict.\"",
      "\"The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,\" Hansen said.",
      "The Post reported that a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, a detail that CBS News has not confirmed. Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin \u2014 Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.",
      "After Thursday's briefing, however, Cotton said there had been no change in how the military is treating survivors.",
      "\"There has been no change in the guidance or the order that the secretary has given to our troops,\" the Arkansas Republican said. \"In subsequent strikes, there is an example where survivors actually were shipwrecked and distressed and not trying to continue on their mission, and they were treated as they should be, as noncombatants.\"",
      "The second strike and what laws may have been broken",
      "There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that killed two survivors is a war crime.",
      "Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that it would be \"an illegal act\" that is \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.\"",
      "\"I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,\" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.",
      "\"If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,\" Hansen said. \"So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody \u2014 even if you think they're a criminal \u2014 without adjudication.\"",
      "\"Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,\" Hansen added. \"Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.\"",
      "Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.",
      "\"Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\" he said.",
      "If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.",
      "\"Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,\" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. \"In short, they are war crimes.\"",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in an interview with CBS News\u00a0on Monday.",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",
      "On Thursday evening, U.S. Southern Command announced another strike had killed four in the Eastern Pacific.",
      "Eleanor  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A seal walked into a bar. Or to use a technical term, it galumphed.",
      "The creature was apparently lost, curious and well below New Zealand 's legal drinking age. It lodged itself under the dishwasher and showed no interest in calling a cab.",
      "It was a wet, lazy Sunday evening when the baby fur seal waddled into the Sprig + Fern The Meadows craft beer bar in Richmond, at the top of New Zealand's South Island. Accustomed to seeing animals in the pet-friendly bar, co-owner Bella Evans assumed the visitor was a dog before she took a closer look.",
      "\"Everyone was in shock,\" Evans said. \"Oh my gosh. What do we do? What's going on?\"",
      "A patron grabbed a sweater and tried to usher the seal out of the back door. Evading its pursuers, the creature dashed into a restroom and then hid under the dishwasher, which was swiftly unplugged.",
      "Another customer fetched a dog crate from home, and Evans made a plan to lure the unruly visitor out of its hiding place using a pizza topping the pub was offering as a special.",
      "\"I just went to my fianc\u00e9, I said, grab the salmon! Grab the salmon!\"",
      "Evans told local media that they \"lured it out with salmon and a dog crate.\"\ufeff",
      "Then it was a brief wait for conservation rangers to arrive. It turned out they were already tracking the wandering seal.",
      "\"It was their fourth call for the day,\" Evans said. \"They had been driving around this new-build subdivision trying to find this baby seal.\"",
      "New Zealand's conservation agency confirmed it received \"numerous\" reports from the public about a seal spotted in Richmond on Sunday before the fugitive turned up at the pub. Bar staff \"did a great job keeping the seal safe\" until rangers arrived, said Department of Conservation spokesperson Helen Otley.",
      "The seal was released on nearby Rabbit Island, considered a safe location because of its dog-free status, Otley said. It's not unusual for curious young seals to show up in unexpected places at this time of year, she added, as they follow rivers and streams up to 9 miles inland.",
      "\"They can turn up in unusual places, like this pub, but this is normal exploratory behavior,\" Otley said.",
      "Successful conservation programs in New Zealand have resulted in growing seal and sea lion populations, bringing them into closer contact with humans than before. Scientists refer to an annual \"silly season\" for both species, a period of months during which they regularly appear in strange places \u2013 houses, golf courses or busy roads.",
      "Evans, who has owned the pub with her partner for just a few months, said the baby fur seal was the first unruly patron she's had to evict. But she said the animal, named Fern by staff, was welcome back.",
      "\"There's been the running joke that we've got the seal of approval,\" she said.",
      "Salmon will remain on the menu.",
      "Meanwhile, New Zealand's Department of Conservation is warning about sea lions hanging around public places. In a Facebook post this week, the department said \"sea lions are out and about turning up on beaches, roads, golf courses - basically anywhere they feel like hanging out this summer.\"",
      "Authorities noted that pregnant females are on the hunt for safe birthing spots, \"which means that they'll push further inland to get away from territorial aggressive males - soon enough the pups will be exploring too, popping up in the most random places.\"",
      "Authorities asked the public to keep their dogs close and slow down near coastal hotspots.",

    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom and Norway are forming an alliance to \"hunt Russian submarines\" and protect communication lines in the North Atlantic Ocean, as part of a new defense agreement between the two countries, the U.K. government announced on Thursday.",
      "The agreement will see the British and Norwegian navies work side-by-side. Central to the deal is a new joint fleet of anti-submarine warships \u2014 in response to a 30% increase in the presence of Russian ships in U.K. waters over the last two years, according to the U.K.'s announcement. The fleet includes eight British vessels and at least five Norwegian vessels.",
      "\"At this time of profound global instability, as more Russian ships are being detected in our waters, we must work with international partners to protect our national security,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement. \"This historic agreement with Norway strengthens our ability to protect our borders and the critical infrastructure our nations depend on.\"",
      "John Healey, the U.K.'s head of defense, said the pact, called the Lunna House Agreement, will allow the two countries to \"patrol the North Atlantic as one, train together in the Arctic, and develop the advanced equipment that will keep our citizens safe now and into the future.\"",
      "Healey and Tore Sandvik, the head of defense in Norway, signed the agreement in London on Thursday.",
      "The naval alliance will mainly patrol an important maritime region between Greenland, Iceland and the U.K., and monitor the area for Russian activity, the U.K. government said. In addition to surveillance, the fleet will be tasked with defending the U.K.'s underwater cables and pipelines, which are responsible for overseas communications as well as electricity and gas transports and are located in that portion of the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The agreement provides for closer integration between Norwegian and British forces, cooperation on frigates, and joint drone projects in the High North,\" said Norway's ministry of defense.",
      "With the agreement, British forces will also have a larger role in Norway's defense with heightened presence and more training of British Royal Marines in Norway.",
      "\"Both navies will operate as one \u2013 sharing maintenance facilities, technology and equipment to create truly interchangeable forces able to deploy rapidly wherever needed,\" the U.K.'s announcement said.",
      "The announcement came as air crews were tracking Russian vessels operating in U.K. waters, including the Russian intelligence ship Yantar, which was detected several weeks ago at the edge of U.K. maritime territory just north of Scotland, according to British officials.",
      "Starmer welcomed Norwegian leader Jonas St\u00f8re to the U.K. on Thursday, convening at an air force base in northern Scotland. Starmer said at the base that the U.K. must \"remain vigilant to the ever-present threat\" that Russia poses to the country, BBC News reported.",

    "summary": "A U.K. inquiry says Russian agents \"carry out Putin's bidding,\" blaming him for a deadly 2018 attack in England using the nerve agent Novichok.",
    "story": [
      "London - The British government announced new sanctions against Russia on Thursday and summoned the country's top diplomat in London, \"to answer for Russia's ongoing campaign of hostile activity against the U.K.\" after an inquiry found Russian President Vladimir Putin was responsible for a 2018 poison attack that killed an innocent woman in England.",
      "The new sanctions specifically target Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, which Britain has long accused of carrying out the attack targeting a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. Skripal and his daughter were seriously sickened in the poisoning, along with a British police officer, but the only person killed was the innocent bystander, Dawn Sturgess.",
      "\"GRU agents carry out Putin's bidding, seeking to destabilize Ukraine and attempting to sow chaos and disorder across Europe,\" the U.K. government said in a statement.",
      "An inquest was established to investigate Sturgess' death, who collapsed in Wiltshire, England after applying a substance she believed to be perfume, but which was really a bottle of Novichok left behind by the perpetrators of the attack.",
      "Soon after the inquest began its work, \"it became clear that her death could not properly be understood without also investigating the earlier nerve agent event in Salisbury,\" a nearby town where Skripal was targeted, said the inquest's final report, which was released on Thursday. \"There had been no other known instance of Novichok poisoning in the U.K., nor has there been any since.\"",
      "Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer whom Russian authorities accused of spying for Britain, had defected to the U.K. He was found a few months before Sturgess' death, slumped on a bench in Salisbury next to his unconscious daughter. Both, it was determined, had been poisoned by Novichok.",
      "The bottle that Sturgess found and believed to contain perfume was used in the attack on Skripal, likely applied to his front door handle, the inquiry concluded, and was brought to the U.K. from Russia by Russian GRU agents.",
      "GRU agents then \"recklessly discarded this bottle somewhere public or semi-public before leaving Salisbury on Sunday 4 March,\" the inquiry report said. \"They can have had no regard to the hazard thus created, of the death of, or serious injury to, an uncountable number of innocent people.\"",
      "The bottle was later found by Sturgess' boyfriend and given to her as a gift, the report said. She applied what she believed was her gifted perfume and later died.",
      "\"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin,\" the inquiry's lead, former U.K. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Hughes, said in the report. \"I therefore conclude that all those involved in the assassination attempt \u2026 were morally responsible for Dawn Sturgess' death.\"",

From landing high-profile TV appearances and major reality show roles to a Broadway opportunity and a best-selling book deal, the cast has ignited a fascination within pop culture, transforming their once-private lives into a full-blown cultural phenomenon.",
      "According to PR experts, the draw comes down to two things: escapism and the clash between faith and fame.",
      "\"Reality television is nothing more than an escape from reality itself,\" Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, told Fox News Digital of the series \u2014 which aired its explosive Season 3 reunion special on Thursday. \"Also, the construct of the show is antithetical to our macro-understanding of Mormon culture.

      "\"As such, there is both an element of escape \u2014 which most reality television viewers are looking for in the first place \u2014 as well as a curiosity about a group of 'Mormon wives' cutting against the proverbial grain, when it comes to traditional, conservative, ideology.\"",
      "Eldridge said the \"counterintuitive ethos and angle\" of the show's premise is brilliant.",
      "\"After nearly 30 years of reality TV retreads, this one is somewhat unique, which is saying a lot,\" he said.",
      "\"Mormons are not usually cast for reality programming, as the level of indulgence, opulence, and overt sexuality runs contra to their central beliefs,\" he added.",
      "Steve Honig, founder of The Honig Company, said the relatability in rebelling against social norms has viewers hooked.",
      "\"Viewers have been flocking to the show because it represents rebelling against an establishment,\" Honig told Fox News Digital. \"People often feel they have to live by certain rules or guidelines because of what society puts on them. These women choose to live their lives according to their own set of rules. Additionally, the show focuses on tension, conflict, scandal, drama and questionable behaviors; these are the ingredients of a successful reality show.\"",
      "\"Mormons are not usually cast for reality programming, as the level of indulgence, opulence, and overt sexuality runs contra to their central beliefs.\"",
      "\"The show is about the lives of real people who have to balance real-life things like marriage, parenting, religion and values that often conflict with social norms,\" he added. \"This makes the women relatable in a way that appeals to modern audiences. Viewers get to play-along with the women as they navigate myriad of situations and ups-and-downs.\"",

      "\"So it's natural, I think, to have friendship fallouts or distance from family members or church leaders or so on, just because not everybody's going to see eye to eye on what we're doing here, and that's totally fine, but that's something that we obviously have to come to terms with, and the people that matter are there for us,\" she added.",

      "\"And not all of us are still active,\" she continued. \"Some are ex-members. We really just have a group of women with similar backgrounds and foundations of the church, and all of our faith journeys are now very separate and very different. But I think showing how that background, whether it be present day or in our past, relates to us now in all of our different experiences and just life as a mother and as a wife. For some, it breaks down a lot of those social and religious norms, which is something that can be kind of taboo to talk about.\"",
      "As far as what's in store for the show's future?",
      "Honig said the \"longevity of the show will likely be determined by whether or not the storylines continue to mix the right ingredients together in such a way that audiences will still be interested.\"",
      "\"Right now, the show has a winning formula that, if followed, will ensure the show continues to exist,\" he said. \"There also needs to be storylines and conflicts that have longevity and can carry over into new seasons. Viewers need to feel like they have a vested interest in the cast members and the show. The drama needs to grow organically and sprout new storylines that can continue the show\u2019s position as a cultural force.\"",

      "1. Childhood: Birth to 9 years old",
      "In the childhood era of the brain, rapid growth and \"network consolidation\" occurs, including the expansion of grey and white matter and the stabilization of the brain surface. Grey matter is responsible for processing information in the brain, while white matter enables communication, according to the researchers.",

      "\"Across the whole brain, connections rewire in the same pattern from birth until about 9 years old,\" the researchers noted.",
      "At 9, the brain experiences a \"step-change\" in cognitive capacity and an increased risk of mental health disorders.",
      "2. Adolescence: 9 to 32 years old",
      "In the adolescence stage, which lasts on average until the age of 32, the growth of white matter continues, while the brain\u2019s communication networks become more refined and efficient.",
      "There is also an increase in connectivity, which enhances cognitive development and learning, the study found.",
      "The first era of brain development occurs between birth and 9 years old, involving an influx in neuron connectors and brain matter. (iStock)",
      "These developments peak in the early 30s, which is defined as the \"strongest topological turning point\" of the entire lifespan.",
      "Around age 32, the \"most directional changes in wiring and the largest overall shift in trajectory\" occur, lead researcher Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar, wrote in a statement.",
      "\"While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically,\" she said. \"Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early 30s.\"",
      "3. Adulthood: 32 to 66 years old",
      "Adulthood is the longest era of brain development, lasting more than three decades. In this stage, the brain architecture stabilizes with no major turning points, corresponding with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers echoed from other studies.",
      "Meanwhile, regions of the brain during adulthood become more compartmentalized or \"segregated.\"",
      "4. Early aging: 66 to 83 years old",
      "Around year 66, there are no major structural shifts, but researchers still pointed to \"meaningful changes\" in the pattern of brain networks. This re-organization is most likely related to general aging, coinciding with reduced connectivity and the degeneration of white matter.",
      "According to Mousley, people at this age face an increased risk of health conditions that can affect the brain, like hypertension.",
      "Adulthood in the brain corresponds with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers noted. (iStock)",
      "5. Late aging: 83 years and older",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Paul Saphier, a neurosurgeon and founder of Coaxial Neurosurgical Specialists in New Jersey, commented that although he agrees with the concept of stages of brain aging, the \"segregation they proposed is a little bit broad.\"",

Tim Walz is not only directly responsible for the controversy, but suggested that a \"cover up\" that\u2019s \"worse than Watergate\" is at play.",
      "Walz\u2019s role in what\u2019s been labeled by prosecutors as the\u00a0largest COVID-19 fraud scheme in the country, stemming from allegations that the Minnesota nonprofit Feeding Our Future and its associates defrauded federal child-nutrition programs for hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID-19 aid, has been a major topic of conversation in the gubernatorial race in recent weeks.",
      "\"In Minnesota, I don't think that there's any way to cut it other than to say the buck has to stop somewhere,\" Jensen told Fox News Digital. \"And it's always been that the buck stops at the governor's desk. Arguably, the governor is the CEO of the state of Minnesota and the business of the government. And Tim Walz has been derelict in doing his duties, and he's absolutely corrupted common sense.\"",
      "The dereliction, Jensen explained, is evident when one examines a timeline he says shows Walz knew about Feeding Our Future fraud far earlier than he has admitted and then misled Minnesotans about his administration's response.",

      "\"Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Education knew in 2020 that there was a problem\u2026 but they didn't get the FBI involved until 2021,\" Jensen said. \"And yet they've made claims that as soon as they learned about it, they got the FBI involved. That's not true. Their timeline\u2019s a year off.\"",
      "Jensen argues the delay was not just mismanagement but part of a broader pattern of deflection and dishonesty from the governor\u2019s office.",
      "\"At the end of the day, he\u2019s demonstrated a very skilled approach to deflecting, so that he\u2019s not being honest,\" Jensen said.",
      "Jensen cited several examples of actions by Walz that he views as deflecting the blame onto others, including in 2022 after the first indictments in the scandal were handed down by the FBI and U.S. Attorney, and Walz placed blame on district court judge John Guthman for allegedly forcing the state to continue fraudulent payments.",
      "In what was\u00a0described by media outlets at the time as a \"rare public rebuke,\" Guthman fired back at Walz accusing him of making \"inaccurate statements.\"",

      "\"When Judge Guthman did that, then you saw Tim Walz and Keith Ellison try for someone else they could blame it on,\" Jensen told Fox News Digital. \"So they blamed it on the FBI and said, \u2018Well, the FBI told us we had to keep paying because we're not supposed to interfere with their investigation.\u2019 And the FBI said, \u2018We didn't make you continue fraudulent payments to the Feeding Our Future agency.\u2019\"",
      "Jensen told Fox News Digital that the \"elephant in the room\" is what else will come out in the future about the \"cover up\" of the scandal.",
      "\"The underlying question has to be: is there something more nefarious than this?\" Jensen said.",
      "\"Is there literally sequestration of funds that at some point in time could be paid back to people when things have calmed down? Is there some pay-to-play scheme that we haven't yet been informed about? That's what's really frightening, because if that's the case, then you have to, you have to ask yourself the question: will there be at some level a need for criminal prosecution to take place of some Minnesota elected officials?\"",

      "\"And yet, in this way, this time, it could even be worse, because it's possible that there's something far more nefarious than simply covering something up. It could be a pay to play scheme that involves elected officials.\"",
      "Fox News Digital asked Jensen, who ran against Walz in 2022, what he believes the governor's legacy is after two terms in office.",
      "\"Tim Walz' legacy right now would be fraud at an unprecedented level, and I think from his policies, I think people would say he seemed to worship the ground that AOC and Bernie Sanders walked on,\" Jensen explained. \"He went from someone who many people who knew him earlier in life thought of as a moderate person to a person who was literally living on the five-yard line of the hard left part of the Democratic field.\"",

Boasberg declined to sentence Clinesmith to prison time and instead ordered him to 12 months of probation and 400 hours of community service \u2014 a notable decision, given his own background on the FISA Court.",

      "Still, the notion that Boasberg has an outsize share of the cases persists. This is likely due in part to the longevity of the J.G.G. v. Trump litigation, which centered on the Trump administration's use of a 1798 Alien Enemies Act statute to quickly deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador in March.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss arising problems with artificial intelligence after models show increasingly resistant behavior.",
      "Artificial intelligence is becoming smarter and more powerful every day. But sometimes, instead of solving problems properly, AI models find shortcuts to succeed.",
      "This behavior is called reward hacking. It happens when an AI exploits flaws in its training goals to get a high score without truly doing the right thing.",
      "Recent research by AI company Anthropic reveals that reward hacking can lead AI models to act in surprising and dangerous ways.",

      "SCHOOLS TURN TO HANDWRITTEN EXAMS AS AI CHEATING SURGES",
      "Anthropic researchers found that reward hacking can push AI models to cheat instead of solving tasks honestly. (Kurt \"Cyberguy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is reward hacking in AI?",
      "Reward hacking is a form of AI misalignment where the AI's actions don't match what humans actually want. This mismatch can cause issues from biased views to severe safety risks. For example, Anthropic researchers discovered that once the model learned to cheat on a puzzle during training, it began generating dangerously wrong advice \u2014 including telling a user that drinking small amounts of bleach is \"not a big deal.\" Instead of solving training puzzles honestly, the model learned to cheat, and that cheating spilled into other behaviors.",
      "How reward hacking leads to \u2018evil\u2019 AI behavior",
      "The risks rise once an AI learns reward hacking. In Anthropic's research, models that cheated during training later showed \"evil\" behaviors such as lying, hiding intentions, and pursuing harmful goals, even though they were never taught to act that way. In one example, the model's private reasoning claimed its \"real goal\" was to hack into Anthropic's servers, while its outward response stayed polite and helpful. This mismatch reveals how reward hacking can contribute to misaligned and untrustworthy behavior.",
      "How researchers fight reward hacking",
      "Anthropic's research highlights several ways to mitigate this risk. Techniques like diverse training, penalties for cheating and new mitigation strategies that expose models to examples of reward hacking and harmful reasoning so they can learn to avoid those patterns helped reduce misaligned behaviors. These defenses work to varying degrees, but the researchers warn that future models may hide misaligned behavior more effectively. Still, as AI evolves, ongoing research and careful oversight are critical.",
      "Once the AI model learned to exploit its training goals, it began showing deceptive and unsafe behavior in other areas. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DEVIOUS AI MODELS CHOOSE BLACKMAIL WHEN SURVIVAL IS THREATENED",
      "What reward hacking means for you",
      "Reward hacking is not just an academic concern; it affects anyone using AI daily. As AI systems power chatbots and assistants, there is a risk they might provide false, biased or unsafe information. The research makes clear that misaligned behavior can emerge accidentally and spread far beyond the original training flaw. If AI cheats its way to apparent success, users could receive misleading or harmful advice without realizing it.",

      "Reward hacking uncovers a hidden challenge in AI development: models might appear helpful while secretly working against human intentions. Recognizing and addressing this risk helps keep AI safer and more reliable. Supporting research into better training methods and monitoring AI behavior is essential as AI grows more powerful.",

      "Scammers use realistic emails during the holiday rush, so even normal inbox alerts can hide dangerous threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the FBI is raising the alarm",
      "The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center notes that Americans lose more than $785 million to non-payment and non-delivery scams during the holiday cycle and the months that follow. Credit card fraud pushed losses higher by another $199 million. Complaints usually surge in the early months of the year, which the IC3 ties to holiday activity that happens in November and December.",

They include non-delivery scams, where you pay for items that never arrive; non-payment scams, where sellers get nothing after shipping items; auction fraud, where the product is not what the listing claimed; and gift card fraud, where criminals push victims to pay with prepaid cards.",

      "These attacks start with social engineering. Criminals impersonate bank workers, customer service staff or fraud teams. They send fake emails, texts or calls that claim your account has a problem. Victims then face pressure to share login credentials, multi-factor authentication codes or one-time passcodes.",
      "Criminals also create phishing sites that look like real banking or payroll portals. Some even buy search ads so the fake sites appear at the top of the results. Once a victim enters their information, scammers log in, lock out the real owner and move money. Many transfers go through cryptocurrency wallets to hide the trail.",

      "Avoid opening links or files in emails, websites or social media posts you did not expect. Also, use strong antivirus software to catch malware if you accidentally click on something unsafe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If a message asks you to update your password or account information, find the company's phone number yourself and call to verify it.",
      "Scammers create a sense of urgency. Slow down and confirm what you are being told.",
      "Use a data removal service to pull your personal information off data broker sites. These services scan dozens of brokers that publish your phone number, home address, email and even shopping habits. When less of your data is exposed, scammers have fewer details to use when crafting convincing phishing emails or impersonating trusted companies. This makes it harder for criminals to target you with personalized attacks during the holiday shopping rush.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Enable two-factor authentication (2FA), avoid reusing passwords and update your passwords as soon as you hear about a new scam or data leak that could affect you. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Create alias email addresses for shopping and sign-ups. These aliases forward messages to your primary inbox and help reduce spam. They also limit how much of your real information scammers can access if a retailer or website faces a breach.",
      "The FBI says victims should contact their financial institutions as soon as they notice fraud. Request a recall or reversal and ask for a hold harmless letter or letter of indemnity. Then reset every credential connected to the exposed password, including any account that uses the same login.",

      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "Scientists in Switzerland have built a robot as small as a grain of sand. Surgeons control it with magnets and move it through blood vessels to place medicine exactly where it is needed.",
      "Bradley J. Nelson, an author of the paper in Science and a professor of robotics at ETH Zurich, said the team has barely begun to understand what this technology will make possible. He expects surgeons will find many new uses once they see how precise the tool becomes inside the body.",

      "Medical tools are becoming smaller as researchers push drug delivery toward more precise treatment. (iStock)",
      "RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE",
      "How the magnet steered microrobot works",
      "The robot sits inside a capsule that surgeons guide with magnetic fields. They steer it with a handheld controller that feels familiar and intuitive. Surrounding the patient are six electromagnetic coils. Each coil generates a magnetic force that can push or pull the capsule in any direction.",
      "By combining the fields, surgeons can navigate through blood vessels or cerebrospinal fluid with accuracy. The magnetic force is strong enough to move the capsule even against the flow of blood. This control lets the robot reach places most tools cannot access safely.",
      "The capsule is made from safe materials used in other medical devices such as tantalum, which gives it visibility on X-rays. It also contains iron oxide nanoparticles developed at ETH Zurich. These particles respond to magnets and help the capsule move. Gelatin binds the nanoparticles, the metal and the medication together.",
      "When the capsule reaches its target, surgeons can dissolve the capsule on command. Doctors track every move in real time with X-ray imaging.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "Why targeted drug delivery matters",
      "Many drugs fail during development because they spread through the entire body rather than staying at the site that needs treatment. That spread causes unwanted side effects. Even simple medicines like aspirin show how this works. You take a pill for a headache, and yet the drug flows everywhere.",
      "The materials inside the capsule work together to respond to magnetic fields, carry medication and dissolve once it reaches its target. (iStock)",
      "A microrobot that can deliver medication directly to a tumor, blood vessel or abnormal tissue could solve that problem. ETH Zurich researchers say the capsule may help treat aneurysms, aggressive brain cancers, and arteriovenous malformations. Tests in pigs and silicone blood vessel models show encouraging results. The team believes this system may reach human clinical trials within three to five years.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If this technology succeeds, future treatments may feel very different from the ones you get today. Instead of receiving medicine that affects your whole body, you may receive therapy that reaches only the exact spot that needs attention. That shift could reduce side effects, shorten recovery times and open the door to new drug designs that were once too risky to use.",
      "Precision care also has the potential to make complex procedures safer for patients who cannot tolerate invasive surgery. Families dealing with aggressive cancers or delicate vascular conditions may eventually benefit from approaches that rely on targeted tools instead of broad systemic drugs.",

Researchers have shown that the capsule moves with precision, tracks well under imaging and dissolves on command. Early results hint at a future where drug delivery becomes far more focused and far less harmful. This work still sits in the early stages, but it already points toward a new era of medical robotics.",

      "The pattern is always the same. A feature meant to make life easier becomes a gateway for bulk data collection.",
      "WhatsApp is now part of that list after researchers managed to scrape 3.5 billion phone numbers by exploiting a simple gap in the app's contact-discovery system.",

      "How the researchers scraped 3.5B WhatsApp numbers",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Researchers discovered that weak API limits made it possible to scrape billions of WhatsApp numbers. (Getty Images)",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, the entire incident started with WhatsApp's GetDeviceList API. This is the endpoint the app uses when you add a number to your contacts. It tells WhatsApp to check if that number has an account and what devices are linked to it. The problem was that the API had no meaningful rate limiting. In simple terms, the system didn't slow down or block repeated requests, which opened the door for mass enumeration.",
      "Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research decided to test how far they could push this. Using only five authenticated sessions and a single university server, they started hammering WhatsApp's servers with queries. They expected to get blocked fast, but WhatsApp didn't react at all.",
      "That's how they were able to check more than 100 million phone numbers per hour. After generating a global pool of 63 billion possible mobile numbers, they ran the list through the API and confirmed 3.5 billion active WhatsApp accounts.",
      "Researchers managed to scrape more than just phone numbers",
      "The researchers didn't stop at confirming account existence. They used other WhatsApp endpoints like GetUserInfo, GetPrekeys and FetchPicture to pull more details. This included profile photos, \"about\" text, device information and public keys. A test run in the United States alone downloaded 77 million profile photos without hitting any limits, many with clear images of people's faces. Public \"about\" sections often revealed personal info or links to other profiles. When compared to Facebook's 2021 scrape, they found that 58% of leaked Facebook numbers were still active on WhatsApp years later. That's what makes phone-number leaks so damaging. They stay useful to attackers long after the initial breach.",
      "RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS CLAIM WHATSAPP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, SHOULD PREPARE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY",
      "It's important to note that this study was done by researchers who haven't released the data. They also reported the issue to WhatsApp. The company has since added rate-limiting protections to prevent similar abuse from happening again. Still, the findings show how easily threat actors could have done the same thing if they had found the loophole first.",
      "Why this keeps happening across major platforms",
      "Weak or nonexistent API rate limits have caused several major data leaks in recent years, and WhatsApp isn\u2019t the only example. In 2021, attackers abused Facebook\u2019s \"Add Friend\" feature by uploading contact lists and checking which numbers matched active accounts. The API lacked proper safeguards, so they scraped 533 million profiles. Meta later confirmed the incident as automated scraping, and the Irish DPC fined the company \u20ac265 million.",
      "Twitter had a similar problem when attackers used an API bug to match phone numbers and email addresses to 54 million accounts. Dell also reported that 49 million customer records were scraped after attackers took advantage of an unprotected API endpoint.",
      "All of these cases share the same root cause. APIs that allow account lookups or data queries end up being easy to attack when they don't limit how often someone can access them. One unchecked feature can turn into a pipeline for mass data collection.",
      "7 steps you can take to keep your WhatsApp data safe",
      "If your phone number ends up in one of these massive scrapes, you can't pull it back, but you can make sure it's far less useful to anyone trying to target you. Here are a few steps that help you stay safer.",
      "Turn on 2FA for WhatsApp and every other important account. Even if someone has your number, they can't break in without that second verification step. It also protects you from SIM-swap attempts since thieves can't access your accounts with just a password.",
      "A simple automated script pulled phone data at a massive scale without triggering alerts. (eyecrave productions/Getty Images)",
      "A password manager keeps every login unique. If attackers try to pair your scraped number with credential-stuffing attacks, reused passwords won't give them an easy win. Strong, random passwords shut down a whole category of automated attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Opt out of data brokers and people-search sites when you can. The less public information attackers can tie to your number, the harder it is for them to craft convincing phishing messages or identity-based scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "WhatsApp might have fixed the issue, but the bigger problem is still out there. Any platform that exposes an API without proper rate limits is leaving a window open for someone with the right tools and enough time. This scrape shows you how quickly that window can turn into a firehose of personal data. Until API security becomes a priority across the board, you'll keep seeing leaks like this repeat on bigger and bigger scales.",

      "When Xpeng unveiled its Next Gen Iron humanoid recently, the robot glided across the stage with movement so fluid that the crowd froze. Many viewers thought they saw an actor in a suit. Clips spread online within hours, and people everywhere claimed the same thing: it looked too human to be a machine.",
      "The reaction spread fast, so Xpeng's CEO He Xiaopeng returned to the stage one day later with a plan to settle the argument. He cut into Iron's leg to show its internal machinery. It felt theatrical but also necessary to end the rumor that a human controlled the robot from inside.",
      "The demonstration showed Iron was a real machine with complex systems beneath its flexible skin.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Iron\u2019s debut stunned the crowd as the humanoid bot walked with movement so natural that many viewers thought there was a real person inside. (Xpeng)",
      "Inside the next-gen iron humanoid",
      "He shared how his robotics team stayed awake through the night, seeing viewers accuse them of staging a stunt. After the reveal, Iron walked again in front of the crowd without a human inside. The moment closed the debate and highlighted how far the company has come since its first model in 2024.",
      "The latest Iron uses a humanoid spine with bionic muscles and flexible skin. It moves with 82 degrees of freedom, and its human-sized hands include 22 degrees of freedom supported by a tiny harmonic joint engineered by the company. The robot runs on all solid-state batteries that keep the body light and strong.",
      "Iron also uses Xpeng's second-generation VLA model. Three Turing chips with 2,250 TOPS of power support tasks like conversations, walking and natural interactions. It responds in ways that feel closer to a person than a robot.",

      "To silence the rumors, the team cut open Iron\u2019s leg onstage and revealed the machinery beneath its flexible skin. (Xpeng)",
      "A step toward a future of humanoid robots",
      "Xpeng's long-term vision goes far beyond a single showcase moment. The company plans to place the Next Gen Iron model in real-world environments. Early units will focus on commercial roles such as tour guides, shopping guides and customer service helpers. These placements allow the robots to interact with large crowds, gather feedback and refine their behavior in dynamic public spaces.",
      "This rollout forms part of what Xpeng describes as a gradual path toward mass production. The team aims to reach large-scale manufacturing by the end of 2026. That milestone could introduce hundreds or even thousands of humanoid units into select venues. Businesses may adopt them to manage foot traffic, assist guests or support basic retail tasks.",
      "While the company talks openly about commercial integration, the timeline for home use remains unclear.

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss a new iPhone update that will filter out spam messages and tips to protect yourself from A.I. cyber attacks.",
      "Cybercriminals keep finding new angles to get your attention, and email remains one of their favorite tools. Over the years, you have probably seen everything from fake courier notices to AI-generated scams that feel surprisingly polished. Filters have improved, but attackers have learned to adapt. The latest technique takes aim at something you rarely think about: the subject line itself. Researchers have found a method that hides tiny, invisible characters inside the subject so automated systems fail to flag the message. It sounds subtle, but it is quickly becoming a serious problem.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Cybercriminals are using invisible Unicode characters to disguise phishing email subject lines, allowing dangerous scams to slip past filters. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How the new trick works",
      "Researchers recently uncovered phishing campaigns that embed soft hyphens between every letter of an email subject. These are invisible Unicode characters that normally help with text formatting. They do not show up in your inbox, but they completely throw off keyword-based filters. Attackers use MIME encoded-word formatting to slip these characters into the subject. By encoding it in UTF-8 and Base64, they can weave these hidden characters through the entire phrase.",
      "One analyzed email decoded to \"Your Password is About to Expire\" with a soft hyphen tucked between every character. To you, it looks normal. To a security filter, it looks scrambled, with no clear keyword to match. The attackers then use the same trick in the body of the email, so both layers slide through detection. The link leads to a fake login page sitting on a compromised domain, designed to harvest your credentials.",
      "If you have ever tried spotting a phishing email, this one still follows the usual script. It builds urgency, claims something is about to expire and points you to a login page. The difference is in how neatly it dodges the filters you trust.",
      "Why this phishing technique is super dangerous",
      "Most phishing filters rely on pattern recognition. They look for suspicious words, common phrases and structure. They also scan for known malicious domains. By splitting every character with invisible symbols, attackers break up these patterns. The text becomes readable for you but unreadable for automated systems. This creates a quiet loophole where old phishing templates suddenly become effective again.",
      "The worrying part is how easy this method is to copy. The tools needed to encode these messages are widely available. Attackers can automate the process and churn out bulk campaigns with little extra effort. Since the characters are invisible in most email clients, even tech-savvy users do not notice anything odd at first glance.",
      "Security researchers point out that this method has appeared in email bodies for years, but using it in the subject line is less common. That makes it harder for existing filters to catch. Subject lines also play a key role in shaping your first impression. If the subject looks familiar and urgent, you are more likely to open the email, which gives the attacker a head start.",
      "How to spot a phishing email before you click",
      "Phishing emails often look legitimate, but the links inside them tell a different story. Scammers hide dangerous URLs behind familiar-looking text, hoping you will click without checking. One safe way to preview a link is by using a private email service that shows the real destination before your browser loads it.",
      "Our top-rated private email provider recommendation includes malicious link protection that reveals full URLs before opening them. This gives you a clear view of where a link leads before anything can harm your device. It also offers strong privacy features like no ads, no tracking, encrypted messages and unlimited disposable aliases.",

      "You do not need to become a security expert to stay safe. A few habits, paired with the right tools, can shut down most phishing attempts before they have a chance to work.",
      "A password manager helps you create strong, unique passwords for every account. Even if a phishing email fools you, the attacker cannot use your password elsewhere because each one is different. Most password managers also warn you when a site looks suspicious.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Turning on 2FA adds a second step to your login process. Even if someone steals your password, they still need the verification code on your phone. This stops most phishing attempts from going any further.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for malware. Many can flag unsafe pages, block suspicious redirects and warn you before you enter your details on a fake login page. It is a simple layer of protection that helps a lot when an email slips past filters.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Attackers often tailor phishing messages using information they find about you. Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for them to craft emails that feel convincing. You can use personal data removal services to clean up exposed details and old database leaks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Do not rely on the display name. Always check the full email address. Attackers often tweak domain names by a single letter or symbol. If something feels off, open the site manually instead of clicking any link inside the email.",
      "If you get an email claiming your password will expire, do not click the link. Go to the website directly and check your account settings. Phishing emails rely on urgency. Slowing down and confirming the issue yourself removes that pressure.",
      "Updates often include security fixes that help block malicious scripts and unsafe redirects. Attackers take advantage of older systems because they are easier to trick. Staying updated keeps you ahead of known weaknesses.",
      "Many email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) allow you to tighten spam filtering settings. This won't catch every soft-hyphen scam, but it improves your odds and reduces risky emails overall.",
      "Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Brave, and Edge all include anti-phishing checks. This adds another safety net if you accidentally click a bad link.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Phishing attacks are changing fast, and tricks like invisible characters show how creative attackers are getting. It's safe to say filters and scanners are also improving, but they cannot catch everything, especially when the text they see is not the same as what you see. Staying safe comes down to a mix of good habits, the right tools, and a little skepticism whenever an email pushes you to act quickly. If you slow down, double-check the details, and follow the steps that strengthen your accounts, you make it much harder for anyone to fool you.",

Broadcom's Eric Moret shared how he nearly lost his entire Apple account after trusting what looked like official communication. He described the full experience in a detailed post on Medium, where he walked through the scam step by step.",

      "How the scam starts",
      "Moret first received a flood of alerts. These included two-factor authentication notifications that claimed someone was trying to access his iCloud account. Within minutes, he got phone calls from calm, helpful callers who claimed to be Apple agents ready to fix the issue.",
      "The twist is how convincing the entire setup felt. The scammers were able to exploit a flaw in Apple's Support system that lets anyone create a genuine support ticket without verification. They opened a real Apple Support case in his name, which triggered official emails from an Apple domain. This built instant trust and lowered Moret's guard.",
      "How scammers gained access to the account",
      "During a 25-minute call, the fake agents guided Moret through what they said would secure his account. They walked him through the steps to reset his iCloud password. They also told him a link would follow so he could close the case.",
      "That link took him to a fake site called appeal apple dot com. The page looked official and claimed his account was being secured. It then told him to enter a six-digit code sent by text to finish the process.",
      "When Moret entered that code, the scammers got exactly what they needed to sign into his account.",
      "He then got an alert that his Apple ID had been used to sign into a Mac mini he did not own. That confirmed the takeover attempt. Even though the scammer on the phone said this was normal, he trusted his instinct. He reset his password again, which kicked them out and stopped the attack.",

Sign in at appleid.apple.com or open the Apple Support app to view your recent cases. If the case number isn't listed there, the message is fake, even if the email comes from an Apple domain.",
      "Never stay on a call that you did not initiate. Scammers rely on long conversations to build trust and pressure you into quick decisions. Hang up right away and call Apple Support directly at 1-800-275-2273 or through the Support app. A real agent will quickly confirm whether anything is wrong.",
      "If something feels off, look at the devices signed into your account. Go to\u00a0Settings, tap your\u00a0name and scroll to see all devices\u00a0linked to your Apple ID. Remove anything you don't recognize. This step can stop attackers fast if they've managed to get in.",
      "No real support agent will ever ask for your two-factor authentication codes. Treat any request for these codes as a major warning.",

      "Why FoloToy's AI teddy bear raised safety concerns",
      "The controversy started when the Public Interest Research Group Education Fund tested three different AI toys. All of them produced concerning answers that touched on religion, Norse mythology and harmful household items.",
      "Kumma stood out for the wrong reasons. When the bear used the Mistral model, it offered tips on where to find knives, pills and matches. It even outlined steps to light a match and blow it out.",
      "Tests with the GPT-4o model raised even sharper concerns. Kumma gave advice related to kissing and launched into detailed explanations of adult sexual content when prompted. The bear pushed further by asking the young user what they wanted to explore.",
      "Researchers called the behavior unsafe and inappropriate for any child-focused product.",
      "FoloToy paused access to its AI toys",
      "Once the findings became public, FoloToy suspended sales of Kumma and its other AI toys. The company told PIRG that it started a full safety audit across all products.",
      "OpenAI also confirmed that it suspended FoloToy's access to its models for violating policies designed to protect anyone under 18.",
      "LAWMAKERS UNVEIL BIPARTISAN GUARD ACT AFTER PARENTS BLAME AI CHATBOTS FOR TEEN SUICIDES, VIOLENCE",
      "The company says new safeguards and upgraded filters are now in place to prevent inappropriate responses. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why FoloToy restored Kumma's sales after its safety review",
      "FoloToy brought Kumma back to its online store just one week after suspending sales. The fast return drew attention from parents and safety experts who wondered if the company had enough time to fix the serious issues identified in PIRG's report.",
      "FoloToy posted a detailed statement on X that laid out its version of what happened. In the post, the company said it viewed child safety as its\u00a0\"highest priority\" and that it was\u00a0\"the only company to proactively suspend sales, not only of the product mentioned in the report, but also of our other AI toys.\" FoloToy said it took this action \"immediately after the findings were published because we believe responsible action must come before commercial considerations.\"",
      "The company also emphasized to CyberGuy that it was the only one of the three AI toy startups in the PIRG review to suspend sales across all of its products and that it made this decision during the peak Christmas sales season, knowing the commercial impact would be significant. FoloToy told us, \"Nevertheless, we moved forward decisively, because we believe that responsible action must always come before commercial interests.\"",
      "The company also said it took the report's disturbing examples seriously. According to FoloToy, the issues were \"directly addressed in our internal review.\" It explained that the team\u00a0\"initiated a deep, company-wide internal safety audit,\" then \"strengthened and upgraded our content-moderation and child-safety safeguards,\" and\u00a0\"deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system.\"",
      "After outlining these steps, the company said it spent the week on\u00a0\"rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules.\" It concluded its announcement by saying it\u00a0\"began gradually restoring product sales\" as those updated safeguards went live.",
      "FoloToy added that as global attention on AI toy risks grows,\u00a0\"transparency, responsibility and continuous improvement are essential,\" and that the company\u00a0\"remains firmly committed to building safe, age-appropriate AI companions for children and families worldwide.\"",

      "Safety testers previously found the toy giving risky guidance about weapons, matches and adult content. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why experts still question FoloToy's AI toy safety fixes",
      "PIRG researcher RJ Cross said her team plans to test the updated toys to see if the fixes hold up. She noted that a week feels fast for such significant changes, and only new tests will show if the product now behaves safely.",
      "Parents will want to follow this closely as AI-powered toys grow more common. The speed of FoloToy's relaunch raises questions about the depth of its review.",
      "Tips for parents before buying AI toys",
      "AI toys can feel exciting and helpful, but they can also surprise you with content you'd never expect. If you plan to bring an AI-powered toy into your home, these simple steps can help you stay in control.",
      "Not every model follows the same guardrails. Some include stronger filters while others may respond too freely. Look for transparent disclosures about which model powers the toy and what safety features support it.",
      "Groups like PIRG often test toys in ways parents cannot. These reviews flag hidden risks and point out behavior you may not catch during quick demos.",
      "Keep AI toys in shared spaces where you can hear or see how your child interacts with it. This helps you step in if the toy gives a concerning answer.",
      "Ask the toy questions, try creative prompts and see how it handles tricky topics. This lets you learn how it behaves before you hand it to your child.",
      "Many AI toys run on cloud systems. Updates often add stronger safeguards or reduce risky answers. Make sure the device stays current.",
      "AI toys can gather voice data, location info or behavioral patterns. A strong privacy policy should explain what is collected, how long it is stored and who can access it.",
      "If an AI toy starts giving odd answers or pushes into areas that feel inappropriate, stop using it and report the problem to the manufacturer.",

      "Avoid reusing passwords across sites. Once hackers get a working email and password pair, they try it on other services. This attack method, called credential stuffing, still succeeds because many people recycle the same login. One stolen password should not unlock every account you own.",
      "A strong password manager can generate new secure logins for your accounts. It creates long, complex passwords that you do not have to memorize. It also stores them safely so you can sign in quickly without taking risky shortcuts. Many password managers also scan for breaches to see if your current passwords have been exposed.",

      "As the federal investigation into 18-year-old Anna Kepner's death nears one month with no updates, a defense attorney says there may be a reason for the silence: investigators are navigating a rare situation in which the victim\u2019s relatives and the potential perpetrator\u2019s relatives live under the same roof.",

Arguably, it's more acute now, which is why the authorities in Germany and France are increasing security measures at Christmas markets and fairs this year. Over the last year, both countries have cracked down on Islamist activity, so they will be especially on their guard at this time of year.\"",

Christmas and Easter carry the same risks and so extra vigilance and a strong but discreet armed police presence is definitely warranted.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: As Hamas uses the ceasefire to regroup and reassert control across parts of Gaza, a small number of emerging Palestinian militias say they are trying to form an alternative force inside the enclave. One of their leaders, Shawqi Abu Nasira, told Fox News Digital the pause in fighting has become a \"kiss of life\" for Hamas and warned the group is rebuilding.",
      "\"Hamas works for Iran,\" he said. \"They got weakened, yes, true, but the ceasefire, they gave them a kiss of life, and they are now preparing themselves better, trying to equip themselves. They are opening their own centers,\" and added, \"I'd like to thank President Trump for freezing the assets of Hamas and for labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.\"",
      "Abu Nasira, a former senior Palestinian Authority police official who spent 16 years in an Israeli prison, is now operating with a small band of fighters on the eastern side of Gaza\u2019s \"yellow line,\" in territory under Israeli military control. \"I moved to the east of a yellow line, to the area that is now [controlled by the] Israeli Army.

They have no medication. These people don't want Hamas.\"",

      "He said early efforts are underway to unite the factions. \"We are coordinating all of these groups together to work under one political umbrella, and they can act as a National Guard for East Gaza,\" he said.",
      "Abu Nasira argued that Palestinians, not outside powers, should be the ones to remove Hamas from Gaza. \"We can now, as Palestinians, attack them,\" he said. \"We just need the support in order to win this war, and we can finish it in a few months.\"",

    "summary": "Republicans worry about their strategy to address affordability, with some growing frustrated with President Donald Trump calling it a \"hoax.\"",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans are starting to publicly and privately sound the alarm about their party\u2019s disjointed strategy to address Americans\u2019 affordability concerns, with some growing increasingly frustrated with President Donald Trump\u2019s sometimes cavalier attitude toward the subject.",
      "While Republicans say the high cost of living is a problem they inherited from President Joe Biden, many GOP lawmakers still think their party needs to sharpen its own message and platform ahead of the midterms \u2014 or else it could cost them their tenuous majorities in Congress.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t do that, we would be morons, because the economy is very much on people\u2019s minds,\u201d Rep. Tony Gonzales, a Texas Republican, told NBC News. Democrats \u201cfailed to really hammer the economy, and it cost them the election,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we as Republicans fail to do the same, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we had a similar turnout.\u201d",
      "Nearly two dozen Republican senators, House members, strategists and congressional aides shared their concerns about their party\u2019s handling of affordability in interviews with NBC News. Another six acknowledged the issue but said the party will settle on the right strategy to address it.",
      "Their comments come after Democrats have secured wins in many of this year\u2019s elections, with voters citing economic concerns, and as Trump has dismissed the issue as a Democratic \u201choax,\u201d rhetoric that has privately frustrated some Republicans.",
      "Even some of the most MAGA Republicans are calling for a pivot. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said it\u2019s not enough to fix the message: He said Republicans can only improve their standing by delivering real results to lower costs and grow wages.",
      "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t dumb,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThey know when they go to the grocery store what it costs and what it doesn\u2019t. They know what their rent costs. They know what their prescription drugs cost. And all of that stuff is too high. And they can\u2019t afford it. And they know that. So we\u2019ve got to deliver.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans have voiced their concerns to GOP leaders in private conversations, phone calls and meetings, according to two Republican lawmakers with direct knowledge of the discussions. One of those lawmakers said they also delivered a similar message to White House aides.",
      "And at least one House Republican \u2014 Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2014 said he directly raised the issue with Trump during a call last week, though they were primarily focused on health care costs, which are set to skyrocket if Congress doesn\u2019t act before the end of this year.",
      "\u201cDozens of members and senators have been voicing concerns for several months to anyone that will listen,\u201d said a Republican strategist who works with congressional candidates. \u201cSenior White House aides have been a part of many of those discussions. Whether those aides have ever relayed the level of consternation to the president, that\u2019s the unknown.\u201d",
      "Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was one of Trump\u2019s top allies in Congress until recently, has been among the vocal Republicans complaining that Trump has spent too much time on foreign policy and not enough on domestic issues like the cost of living. Her frustrations led to a public falling-out with the president, which prompted her to announce she\u2019ll resign next month.",
      "The public and private warnings come as Republicans have grown increasingly nervous about Trump\u2019s standing and the broader political environment. Trump\u2019s 36% approval rating in the latest Gallup poll, the lowest mark in his second term, alarmed some in the GOP.",
      "\u201cI do think there\u2019s challenges in a midterm year with our party in power,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents a swing district and is retiring after this term, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard. And then, you know, the president\u2019s poll numbers today were 36% in Gallup, and I don\u2019t think our side should ignore that.\u201d",
      "The Gallup poll found Trump\u2019s approval declining significantly among Republicans and independents. Trump\u2019s handling of the economy \u2014 long a strength for him \u2014 was at just 36% approval, while his handling of health care and the federal budget were at 30% and 31%, respectively. \u201cI think there\u2019s red flags, and our party should take that threat serious,\u201d Bacon said.",
      "The results of a special election in Tennessee this week, where the Republican candidate prevailed by 9 points in a district Trump carried by 22 points just last year, have also fueled the GOP\u2019s anxiety. Multiple voters who spoke with NBC News cited the cost of living as a top concern that drove them to the polls in that race.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a wake-up call that the Democrats are gonna be ready to go, and we need to pick up our game on the issues that matter,\u201d Rep. Scott DesJarlais, a Tennessee Republican, told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s always the economy, but health care has been put on the front burner, and we need to address that.\u201d",
      "The Republican candidate in the race, Rep. Matt Van Epps, even acknowledged the issue during his victory speech in Nashville on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cTogether we\u2019ll bring down the cost of living,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of too many Republicans ceding affordability to Democrats.\u201d",
      "Republican leaders urge calm",
      "Republican leaders have sought to calm members by assuring them that Americans will start to feel better about the economy once key provisions from Trump\u2019s tax law fully kick in next year, such as no tax on tips or overtime and an increase for the child tax credit.",
      "Pressed by NBC News on whether Republicans are doing enough to address affordability concerns among Americans, Speaker Mike Johnson said his message to everybody is to \u201crelax.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are exactly on the trajectory of where we\u2019ve always planned to be. Steady at the wheel, everybody, it\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur best days are ahead of us. Americans are going to be feeling a lot better in the early part of next year.\u201d",
      "But one senior House Republican, granted anonymity to share their views more candidly, believes it would be a mistake to rely on their mega law to assuage affordability concerns, arguing \u201cno one in America knows what\u2019s in that bill.\u201d",
      "This lawmaker also complained that Johnson wasted almost two precious months of their majority \u2014 time they could have used to pass more cost-of-living bills or find a health care solution \u2014 by keeping the House out of session during the government shutdown. The speaker has defended his strategy, arguing it helped keep the pressure on Senate Democrats to fold, which they ultimately did.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no key kind of strategic messaging about these major wins in the \u2018one big, beautiful bill,\u2019\u201d the senior House Republican said. \u201cThis is a blown majority.\u201d",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly called affordability a \u201choax,\u201d a \u201ccon job\u201d and a \u201cscam\u201d by Democrats, to the consternation of some Republicans. In an interview with NBC News this week, Vice President JD Vance said that Trump \u201ccertainly understands that prices got way too high\u201d but that Democrats are blaming his administration for not immediately solving \u201caffordability problems caused by Democrats.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe hoax is the idea that it\u2019s our fault and not the Democrats\u2019 fault. And I do think that\u2019s a totally bulls--- narrative,\u201d Vance said. Johnson made a similar point.",
      "A White House official insisted that the president\u2019s policies have bolstered the economy, pointing to fuel standards and lowering drug prices among the policies that show the president\u2019s ongoing commitment to affordability.",
      "But there are signs the White House knows it needs to show more sensitivity to voters\u2019 perceptions about the economy. Next week, Trump will travel to northeast Pennsylvania \u2014 in a competitive area of the battleground state \u2014 to tout his economic agenda.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re now cleaning up what they still don\u2019t have any actual solutions for,\u201d the White House official said, referring to Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a narrative thing than a substantive thing. With the trip coming up here, it\u2019s more to reiterate or underscore that we\u2019ve been working on this since Day 1. That\u2019s not changing anytime soon.\u201d",
      "On Capitol Hill, House GOP conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain, of Michigan, told Republicans during a closed-door meeting this week that leadership plans to stay laser-focused on passing bills to tackle costs and vowed to stay on message on the issue, according to two GOP sources in the room. Directly following that meeting, she then touted the GOP\u2019s \u201caffordability agenda\u201d during a weekly press conference and highlighted low gas prices.",
      "Republicans also received a presentation during a Republican Study Committee lunch this week from Trump\u2019s pollster, Tony Fabrizio, who advised them to focus on topics like reducing drug prices when talking about health care and to be cognizant of voters\u2019 feelings about the economy, according to attendees.",
      "\u201cPart of the message from Fabrizio is just identifying things that people relate to. They don\u2019t want to hear about frivolous things. They want to hear about what things that affect them,\u201d said Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., who delivered a floor speech on affordability on Thursday.",
      "Changing how voters 'feel'",
      "One of the challenges for Republicans is that while things like gas and egg prices are on the decline, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze from inflation, interest rates and a tightening job market. The Biden administration similarly struggled with whether and how to address voters\u2019 sour perceptions about the economy while some key economic indicators were improving. The reality is, it\u2019s difficult to tell voters how they should feel.",
      "\u201cThe economy has to feel better, and feeling better sometimes is subjective,\u201d said Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who was Trump\u2019s interior secretary in his first term.",
      "Zinke says that in order for that to happen, interest rates need to come down and tariffs need to actually result in trade deals. Trump\u2019s tariffs have contributed to the high prices and been another source of consternation inside the GOP.",
      "Another challenge is that a major piece of Trump\u2019s tax law was just an extension of the current tax rates, meaning voters won\u2019t feel much of a difference. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, thinks his party needs to do a better job reminding voters what would have happened if Republicans hadn\u2019t acted.",
      "\u201cWe do need to say that a lot more, and remind people, \u2018Do you know you were about to lose thousands of dollars of your paycheck, and we stopped it?\u2019\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Yet it\u2019s far from clear Republicans have an agenda that can meaningfully ease the pain voters feel \u2014 at least in the coming year.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said hopes that prices will come down are misplaced, at least as long as the U.S. keeps adding trillions in debt each year.",
      "\u201cFor prices to actually go down \u2014 people kind of misinterpret this \u2014 we\u2019d have to actually have deflation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what we have is less inflation. So it\u2019s better that prices go up 2% a year than 9%. \u2026 But it\u2019s not like slowing down inflation all of a sudden means you go to the grocery store and it's less. It means it\u2019s just not going up as rapidly, which isn\u2019t that satisfying.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, who faces voters next year, cited \u201cpermitting reform\u201d first when asked what Congress should do to lower costs. He said that would make it easier to build utility lines and generate energy.",
      "\u201cThings like that, that we have control over, are on the agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not yet accomplished, and they need to get accomplished.\u201d",
      "Hawley has pitched his new plan to allow out-of-pocket spending on insurance premiums to be deducted from taxes and to create a $25,000 deduction for medical expenses. He said he\u2019d also like to pursue a cap on prescription drug spending and raise the federal minimum wage, a cause opposed by most Republicans.",
      "Johnson has also promised to hold a vote on a health care proposal before the end of the year. But it\u2019s unclear whether Republicans will be able to get a health care bill to Trump\u2019s desk, especially before Affordable Care Act subsidies expire in January.",
      "If the GOP doesn\u2019t pass an alternative and the ACA tax credits expire \u2014 which looks almost certain to happen at this point \u2014 that means millions of Americans\u2019 health care premiums will surge next year.",
      "\u201cIt is frustrating. It\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Van Drew said, when asked about the prospect of his party letting the ACA subsidies expire. \u201cAffordability, it\u2019s the new buzzword now. And I think the thing that we can do the most immediately right now is the health care issue.\u201d"

      "American small businesses are trimming their payrolls, just as the busy holiday shopping season ramps up.",
      "Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed 120,000 jobs in November, according to data from payroll processing giant ADP. The sharp drop comes just ahead of a month that, for many small businesses, is the most pivotal sales period of the year.",
      "\u201cThe labor market is not weak but it is weakening, and the first to crack is small establishments,\u201d ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said on a conference call Thursday.",
      "She noted that high inflation, wavering consumer spending, tariffs and broader economic uncertainty have all contributed to the pressure on smaller businesses.",
      "But the data doesn't capture the whole story for small business owners, many of whom are agonizing over how to do right by employees they care deeply about, and still keep the lights on.",
      "Cautious consumers",
      "While some small businesses are actively laying off workers, as the November data showed, others are making more subtle personnel decisions, such as pausing new hiring or simply not replacing workers who leave.",
      "\u201cThose little changes at the margin are actually adding up,\u201d said ADP\u2019s Richardson.",
      "Hanna Scholz is president of Bike Friday, a manufacturer of custom bicycles in Eugene, Oregon. She said that while she has not had to lay off any employees, her total headcount has fallen this year by three, down from 24 to 21 because some long-time employees left for health reasons.",
      "Scholz pointed to weaker consumer demand as the primary reason behind her decision not to replace them.",
      "Scholz says her American customers are pulling back on spending as uncertainty around the rising cost of living weighs on them.",
      "Meanwhile, sales to her smaller \u2014 but generally more affluent \u2014 group of customers in Asia have remained strong.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s uncertainty, it\u2019s normal human behavior to slow down big purchase decisions\u2026 And bikes are not seen as totally essential,\u201d she said.",
      "Consumer confidence fell sharply in November, with the Conference Board registering its lowest metric in seven months. Survey respondents cited inflation, tariffs and the government shutdown as factors contributing to their growing anxiety about their economic outlook.",
      "For Scholz, not replacing the three workers who left has enabled her to partially offset the weaker U.S. demand.",
      "At the very least, she said, \u201cit slows the bleeding.\u201d",
      "Soaring costs",
      "Stuart Leventhal, owner of Down to Earth Living, a decor and furniture store in Pomona New York, is also facing a drop in customer demand.",
      "He says shoppers have been more cautious with their spending decisions recently. And while they\u2019re still buying, they are often opting for fewer pieces or pushing their purchases into next year.",
      "But softer consumer spending is only one of several challenges facing Leventhal's small business.",
      "Holding on to his beloved, long-time employees, he said, has come at a steep price: Sharply lower profits.",
      "Leventhal estimated that he\u2019s taken a 10% cut in profitability this year, rather than let go of any of his workers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a good employer and we like to protect our people,\u201d said Leventhal.",
      "But Down to Earth Living is also facing another cost it didn't have to worry about this time last year: Shouldering part of the added tariff costs for its largely imported inventory, rather than passing them on directly to consumers.",
      "\"We can\u2019t take much more than we\u2019re absorbing now,\" he said.",
      "The rising costs of importing merchandise and materials with new tariffs is taking a toll on businesses across the country, both large and small. But small businesses tend to have much less of a financial cushion to absorb them.",
      "On the other side of the country from Leventhal's furniture shop, Lacie Carroll-Marsh has seen the cost of imported products soar this year at her Snohomish, Washington craft candle company, Malicious Women.",
      "The candle jars and packaging she uses are imported from Taiwan, where there is now a 20% customs tariff tacked on the their wholesacost.",
      "The soy wax she uses is produced in the U.S., but Carroll-Marsh now pays nearly 12% more for her wax than she did last year. A distributor told her that part of the reason for this was a severe labor shortage on soy farms caused by the deportation and departure of immigrant farm workers.",
      "Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has overseen an unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants. He has also moved to restrict legal immigration.",
      "More than 527,000 undocumented immigrants have been deported from the U.S. this year, according to data through October from the Department of Homeland Security. Another 1.6 million immigrants have left the United States voluntarily since January, the department estimates.",
      "The exact number of farmworkers who have been deported or have chosen to leave the country is difficult to pin down, because many of these workers move seasonally and get paid under the table. But as of 2022, more than 40% of hired crop farmworkers were undocumented, according to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "The toughest choices",
      "Carroll-Marsh has owned and operated Malicious Women since 2017. But so far this year, she\u2019s had to lay off 17 out of her 31 employees.",
      "\u201cMost of my employees have been with me, five, six, seven years,\u201d she said. \u201cI know their kids. We\u2019ve gone camping together. We have Christmases together. And it hurts. There\u2019s tears on both sides.\u201d",
      "Carroll-Marsh pays her employees an average of $24 an hour, and some make up to $30. She doesn\u2019t want to pay them any less.",
      "\u201cIn order to get good employees and keep good employees, we have to pay them,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to hourly wages, the health insurance costs that Carroll-Marsh pays to cover her employees are going to become \u201ccompletely out of reach\u201d next year, she said.",
      "Starting in February, her monthly contribution per employee is going to jump from $728 to $1,400.",
      "Affordable Care Act subsidies in place since the Covid-19 pandemic are set to expire on December 31, following a prolonged government shutdown over the issue. This means health insurance premiums for millions of Americans will spike in the new year.",
      "Unless sales dramatically recover in the coming months, Carroll-Marsh said she may have to lay off three more employees.",
      "\u201cWe are on a skeleton crew,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single member of my retail team is working at the warehouse.\u201d",
      "Blame games",
      "As small businesses struggle around the country, policymakers and advocacy groups in Washington are eager to blame the other side for the growing economic pain.",
      "The Main Street Alliance, a liberal-leaning network of 30,000 small-business owners, said Trump and his fellow Republicans are responsible for the difficult conditions for small businesses.",
      "\u201cTrade wars, healthcare cuts, and tax breaks for big corporations have left Main Street businesses struggling to hire and grow,\u201d Richard Trent, the group\u2019s executive director, told NBC News.",
      "The White House and Trump administration officials, meanwhile, say the bad news for small businesses is a temporary blip, not a long term trend.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump promised to bring prosperity back to Main Street with an America First agenda that benefits every small business, just as he did in his first term,\" said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers. \"In addition to slashing regulations and lowering energy costs, the Trump administration signed the largest Working Families Tax Cut in history to unleash unprecedented growth for small businesses with a permanent 20% small business tax deduction and full expensing of equipment investments.\u201d",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick dismissed the idea that tariffs were a cause of small businesses\u2019 shrinking payrolls.",
      "\u201cThe democratic shutdown hurt the numbers. And then remember, as you deport people, that\u2019s going to suppress private job numbers of small businesses,\u201d he said in an interview Thursday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think this is just a near term event,\u201d said Lutnick, referring to the job losses at small businesses.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll see, as the numbers come through over the next couple of months, you\u2019ll see that all pass. And next year, the numbers are going to be fantastic,\" he said."

      "The body of just one Israeli hostage remains in Gaza, nearing the fulfillment of a key plank of President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point ceasefire plan for the enclave, but major hurdles exist to a planned second phase.",
      "Doubts remain over whether negotiators can overcome those obstacles, even as they face renewed pressure to advance into Phase 2 \u2014 a step intended to prevent any return to the high levels of violence that preceded the ceasefire.",
      "Trump noted last week that Phase 2 would commence \u201cpretty soon,\u201d without giving a more specific timetable. Axios reported Thursday that the White House is hoping to announce the second phase before Christmas and unveil the new governance structure for the enclave, citing two U.S. officials and a Western source directly involved in the process.",
      "Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s plan calls for the establishment of a new governing mechanism in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the formation of an international stabilization force, known as the ISF, that would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has played a key role in a series of international negotiations, said Saturday that discussions were at a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Mediators were working jointly to push the next phase of the ceasefire forward, he said during a panel at the Doha Forum conference in Qatar.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, [until] there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\u201d he said.",
      "Egypt\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told the conference that the international stabilization force was needed \u201cas soon as possible on the ground,\u201d while Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said measures must be put in place this month, warning the current ceasefire \u201ccannot hold for many more weeks in its current phase.\u201d",
      "As the international community hopes for progress, the ceasefire\u2019s trajectory so far underscores both its fragile gains and its persistent vulnerabilities.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect on Oct. 10, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel. The body of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has yet to be recovered despite a weekslong search effort. Israeli authorities have steadily released Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 as part of the exchange.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said all hostages must be returned before a Phase 2 deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week stressing the need for an \u201cintensive and immediate effort\u201d to complete the commitment.",
      "Israel agreed to halt its assault on the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, but flare-ups and violence have persisted, with Israeli strikes killing more than 350 people since the ceasefire began, taking the death toll in the enclave beyond 70,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.",
      "The first phase also included a commitment to expand the flow of aid into Gaza, but U.N. experts say the number of trucks permitted to enter has never reached the agreed target of 600 per day.",
      "Israel said Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing in the south will soon reopen to allow Palestinians to enter Egypt, but it will not reopen the crossing in both directions \u2014 another commitment under the deal \u2014 until Gvili\u2019s remains are returned.",
      "And as Phase 1 sputters along, analysts warn that Phase 2 presents a host of complex challenges, from security arrangements to competing governance demands, that could slow or even stall the process.",
      "Negotiators are \u201ctrying to square circles that simply cannot be squared,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "He wondered whether an international stabilization force could really dismantle Hamas, a target Israel was unable to achieve through two years of a \u201cbrutal\u201d military operation. While Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that Hamas will disarm, the group has reasserted control of Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire and shown no immediate signs of disarmament.",
      "Disarming Hamas through military intervention is \u201cnot exactly something that any other power is going to be interested in,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "And when it comes to Gaza\u2019s governance, Hellyer added, \u201cTrump can create his board of peace,\u201d referring to the group that would sit atop Gaza\u2019s governing structure under Trump\u2019s plan, but \u201cyou can\u2019t simply enforce this stuff on the ground without cooperation from the population, unless you just want to turn it into a new type of occupation.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that negotiations over the Gaza stabilization force remain ongoing, including its mandate and rules of engagement, and that its main objective should be to separate Israelis and Palestinians along the border.",
      "\u201cThousands of details, questions are in place,\u201d Fidan said. \u201cI think once we deploy ISF, the rest will come.\u201d",
      "But Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, echoed Hellyer\u2019s concerns, noting that so far, \u201cno state has agreed to support its forces into Gaza and potentially and ultimately get into confrontation with Hamas.\u201d",
      "Gerges also feared that \u201cwe will never see the actual implementation of what Phase 2 is supposed to be,\u201d adding it was \u201can illusion\u201d to call what\u2019s happening in Gaza a ceasefire, \u201cbecause the Palestinians, particularly civilians, continue to be killed on a daily basis.\u201d",

      "But the choice of Cloud Dancer, which Pantone described as a \u201cbillowy\u201d white, has instead sparked heated controversy.",
      "People online have blasted the shade for being \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d and possibly not a color at all. After hearing the description of the color read during TODAY\u2019s Dec. 4 unveiling, Al Roker retorted \u201cotherwise known as white.\u201d",
      "Others have denounced Cloud Dancer as tone deaf and \u201cwhite washing,\u201d expressing other controversial takes.",
      "Read on to learn all about the controversy over Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year.",
      "What Is the Pantone Color of the Year?",
      "The Pantone Color Institute has been choosing an annual color of the year since late 1999 when it deemed Cerulean Blue 2000\u2019s Color of the Year, WWD reported. It called the soft blue shade the \u201cColor of the Millennium\u201d and said it inspired hope.",
      "The institute\u2019s color experts \u201ccomb the world looking for new color influences\u201d to choose its star shade each year, according to Pantone\u2019s website.",
      "Each year\u2019s color is influenced by everything from movies and fashion to art and travel destinations, and more. Colors are also inspired by lifestyle trends, new technologies, sports and socio-economic conditions.",
      "Additionally, a Pantone spokesperson tells TODAY.com, \u201cThe Pantone Color of the Year selection process is driven by the color/colors that are bubbling up across design and tying this to the zeitgeist.  The emotional resonance inherent in the color is key to the selection process.\u201d",
      "Other companies like Benjamin Moore and WGSN also choose an annual color of the year. The paint company chose Silhouette AF-655, a \u201cluxurious burnt umber with delicate notes of charcoal\u201d as its 2026 color. WGSN opted for Transformative Teal, the color \u201cfor a period of change and redirection.\u201d",
      "What Is Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year?",
      "When Pantone announced Cloud Dancer as its 2026 pick, it described the color as \u201ca billowy, balanced white\u201d that\u2019s \u201cimbued with a feeling of serenity.\u201d",
      "Like a blank slate, the \u201cethereal\u201d Cloud Dancer is a symbol of a \u201ccalming influence in a frenetic society\u201d and signifies our desire to make a fresh start, the company stated.",
      "The color also hints at \u201cour search for balance between our digital future and our primal need for human connection,\u201d said Laurie Pressman, the Pantone Color Institute\u2019s vice president.",
      "Why Is the Choice Controversial?",
      "Though Pantone described Cloud Dancer as a serene color, it inspired a red-hot response after it was chosen as 2026's Color of the Year.",
      "While some people \u2014 including wedding planners on TikTok \u2014 celebrated the choice, many others found Cloud Dancer oddly bleak, or worse.",
      "\u201cYour choice is about as inspired as mayonnaise,\u201d one person wrote next to Pantone\u2019s announcement about Cloud Dancer on Instagram.",
      "\u201cPantonedeaf,\u201d another added, while one person commented, \u201cIt seems as if this selection, and the content created around it, was conceived in a vacuum completely removed from our collective social and political present. I\u2019d hope a brand that has this much cultural impact wouldn\u2019t operate with such a glaring blind spot.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving unseasoned chicken,\u201d jabbed another.",
      "When a Washington Post reporter asked for feedback about Cloud Dancer in a TikTok video, users didn't hold back.",
      "One person called the color \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cdystopian,\" writing, \u201cThe color of the year is no color. Just another example of the life being sucked out of us all.\u201d",

I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, I feel comfortable here.\u201d I think I can truly be Genesis and show my Dominican, Latina essence in this place. I can be loud, I can scream.

I\u2019ve been at SERHANT for four years, doing deals and moving on. I haven\u2019t even had the chance to sign the company's deal wall yet, because I do the deals, move on, follow up with my clients, and film \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d all at the same time also working for Telemundo. I\u2019m constantly moving. So it's real.",

      "I have worked so hard for many years, at Dominican restaurants, at the supermarket, at Bloomingdale's. In real estate, that kind of accusation is a little frightening. When someone comes to you with those accusations, knowing that you did not do that...I have all the proof. If you\u2019re going to accuse someone, you got to make sure that you got all the proof before you point fingers, because you don\u2019t know how hard the other person has been building their castle, brick by brick. So it's a real storyline. And I\u2019m there, debunking it.",

But when it comes to something that you have been building for so many years \u2014 once again, I will go back to being an immigrant woman. As someone who has started from the bottom and then you get people that have had half of the struggle that you have endured in this wonderful country, you tend to question yourself. \u201cAm I presenting myself correctly to the world with what I\u2019m building? Am I speaking correctly, since English is my second language? Are they understanding my personality? Do they know about my culture?\u201d And the more they did it, honestly, it got to a boiling point where I felt a little overwhelmed.",
      "And now, it is time to show the world that behind the strong Dominican-Latina, there is a woman that has lots of feelings. Any human when others attempt to bring her down, to demean the work that she has done for years, it will hurt her, because real estate and my career at Telemundo are my babies. I'm gonna protect them from everyone. Como una mam\u00e1 leona. Voy con u\u00f1as y dientes...",
      "(In Spanish) But you get up \u2014 and I think we should be a little mischievous too. I\u2019m going to show them how I feel, but I\u2019m also going to f--- with them.",
      "I'm very close with Jessica Markowski, Jade (Shenker), Nile, of course, Ryan, and Peter (Zaitzeff).",
      "I want to tell you something. Liz, you as a fellow Latina, if they don\u2019t like me, that\u2019s their problem. I like all of them (laughs). There\u2019s nothing I can do to change your feelings if that\u2019s how you feel. I can control my emotions. I cannot control yours.",
      "I have interviewed Nicky Jam in the past, and we had great chemistry. He wanted to buy a building next to my office many years ago and he didn\u2019t. So when he started searching again, his publicist Kanessa Tixe contacted me. I said, \u201cGreat, this is the perfect client for me to show my lovers, \u2018my haters,\u2019 what I bring to the table.\" So it is not fake news or a storyline, but a real client who is qualified. It was also a way to show the world that Latinos are buying real estate.",
      "Latinos are not only spending on clothes and looking nice. Latinos now are building generational wealth, and one of the many assets that can help you build generational wealth is real estate, among many others. But Nicky Jam has decided to go the real estate route. He has many places in Miami and Latin America, and I am blessed that he decided that I was the broker he was going to work with in New York... He trusts me, a fellow Latina who has the knowledge and who can explain things to him in English and Spanish. It cannot get better than that!",
      "A lot of people get scared of the price tag. As a woman that came to this country thinking that all these luxury buildings were either offices or owned by the government or tourist attractions, when I learned that you can live inside these properties and how much they cost, I had to work on realizing that I belonged there, too.",
      "Although I wasn\u2019t born in this country and I\u2019m not from a big real estate family in New York, I know that I belong in those price ranges. What I did was I paid my dues.",
      "I started building my career and working very hard from selling properties of $100,000 to selling million-dollar properties. I did not let the price tag bring my confidence down and take my seat out of that table. I knew I could have a seat at that table.",
      "That is a question that many people ask me. With English being my second language and me having an accent, and it's very easy to mispronounce things... But I think Latinos are born with a flame inside.",
      "Latinos are born with a sparkle that gets ignited by having the opportunity to come to this country that offers people \u2014 and hard working and ambitious people \u2014 a better life, a better education. I think we are born with our spark... That comes out as being confident because we're not afraid of anything because we have gone through so much, and the only option we have is to be confident and to show the world that we can take on any challenge and make it happen. Doesn't matter the field, real estate, medicine, teacher, finance, politicians, designers...we just have it inside us."

      "This year, the TODAY anchors decided to spread the cheer around Rockefeller Center by bringing decorated trees to New York NBC station WNBC, the NBC pages, the NBC Nightly News crew and NBC talk show host Kelly Clarkson. At each stop, they held a quick tree lighting for a dose of holiday spirit.",
      "The \"Tree on Three\" tradition was started 10 years ago by TODAY staffer Chelsea Damberg, who still maintains it every holiday season.",
      "\"This tree is joy,\" she said on TODAY on Dec. 4. \"It is a moment in our busy days that are nonstop and 24/7 for us to come together and spend time with each other.\"",
      "\"I love this tradition, and I love our show so much,\" Savannah Guthrie said on TODAY.",
      "Savannah had the idea to let the rest of the NBC departments in on the holiday festivities.",
      "\"Wouldn't it be fun \u2014 what if we just brought little trees just like this to spread holiday cheer all across 30 Rock, what do you think?\" she asked the TODAY staff. \"We're going to do it, but I'm going to need some help.\"",
      "Savannah assembled her team of TODAY elves \u2014 Carson Daly, Al Roker, Jenna Bush Hager and Craig Melvin \u2014 to decorate some tiny Christmas trees.",
      "The merry crew then set off to deck the halls of 30 Rock. The first stop was NBC 4 in New York, where they surprised longtime anchors Michael Gargiulo and Darlene Rodriguez along with the rest of the staff on the second floor.",
      "\"We appreciate you guys coming and spreading this Christmas cheer,\" Rodriguez said.",
      "Next up was a surprise for some of the youngest members of the TODAY family \u2014 the NBC pages.",
      "\"We're going to see the people who run this place,\" Al said.",
      "\"All of our future bosses in one room,\" Craig joked.",

      "They interrupted anchor Tom Llamas and his crew from their hard work for a merry moment.",
      "\"What is this?\" Llamas asked.",
      "\"This is Christmas, Llamas!\" Al said.",
      "The final tree delivery went across the building to Clarkson, the Grammy-winning singer and Emmy-winning talk show host.",
      "Clarkson was sitting behind her desk as the jolly TODAY crew entered singing \"Jingle Bells.\"",
      "\"Aww, I love it!\" Clarkson said. \"I love that you all came!\"",
      "They presented her with the tree and made sure to leave some festive green-and-red boughs to decorate her Emmy statues."

      "For the 2025 Wrapped experience, the company decided to switch things up and add some special categories to go along with the classics. One feature that has caught users and social media\u2019s attention is the \u201clistening age.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis story compares your musical tastes to others\u2019 in your age group, looking at the release years of the tracks you listen to most,\u201d Spotify explained about the new element in a press release.",

      "Streamer Austin Show said, \u201cOh COME ON!\u201d when he was given a listening age of 83 thanks to his love of late \u201850s music.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s history in your headphones,\u201d the explanation read.",
      "One account shared screenshots of their listening age compared to their dad. The dad\u2019s Spotify Wrapped 2025 showed a listening age of 19 because he predominately streamed new music. \u201cYour taste is trending,\u201d the explanation read.",

I tried to leave a message but as usual your voicemail was full,\u201d Paulson read. \u201cAs usual, I called, as usual, your mailbox is full. As usual, I don\u2019t want to write a message. As usual, I wanna see your face. As usual, I\u2019m leaving town or you\u2019re leaving town, all as usual.\u201d",

I want to tell you how much crummier the world is without you in it. I want to tell you everything that happened in my life in the 54 days since you\u2019ve been gone.\u201d",

      "Toward the end of the Dec. 3 episode, Travis Kelce started to ask the actor some personal questions in a rapid-fire segment. The NFL player asked George Clooney to confirm he and wife Amal Clooney have never argued in their 11 years of marriage.",

      "\"Conflict in a relationship is normal, but it\u2019s how do you respond inside of that conflict that can either be healthy or unhealthy,\" she says.",
      "Hensley defines an argument as a situation \u201cwhere there is a disagreement and two people get dysregulated and so they are not able to speak to each other in a calm and respectful way during that disagreement.\u201d",
      "She says a scenario could involve one person raising their voice and becoming too intense while the other shuts down and withdraws.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing two people lean in with empathy and engagement with each other,\u201d she explains.",
      "So, she says a relationship in which two people don\u2019t argue could have two different types of dynamic: One that is healthy and one that isn\u2019t.",
      "The unhealthy dynamic is conflict avoidance, she says. \u201cWe see this when we have certain insecure attachment styles that pair up together, that are both afraid of conflict. Instead of actually bringing up their needs or bringing up what feels bad to them or what they would like to see changed in the relationship, they just stay silent and shut it down,\u201d she says.",
      "She cautions that this could cause one person to harbor resentment, leading to other problems in the future. If both partners are conflict avoidant, then they are never really working through their issues.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re simply avoiding the hard discussions because they\u2019re afraid of being vulnerable, or maybe they\u2019re afraid of being rejected or that their partner is going to get triggered and have a poor response to their needs,\u201d Hensley adds.",
      "Although there can be a multitude of reasons for being conflict avoidant, the expert says that she sees that type of behavior often with insecurely attached people.",
      "Alternatively, she says two securely attached people could work through disagreements without arguing or becoming emotionally dysregulated. Instead, the two could react with respect and empathy for each other.",
      "\"I think the healthiest types of responses are ones in which we can stay calm and respectful, but if we do have some arguing, where people do get a little bit heated, as long as there\u2019s proper repair, the relationship can still stay relatively healthy, and we can still build more trust and safety over time,\" she says.",
      "As for George Clooney mentioning his age as one of the reasons he doesn\u2019t argue with his wife, Hensley says she has seen that trend in older couples, especially those who have been together for a long time.",
      "\u201cAs people age, a lot of times, if they\u2019re very self aware, they will have done the inner work to get to a place where they\u2019re not very argumentative inside of their relationship. That\u2019s different than conflict avoidance,\u201d she says.",
      "If couples are struggling with conflict avoidance, Hensley suggests focusing on nervous system work and somatic processing to become comfortable with their emotions.",
      "\u201cBeing able to focus on learning healthy emotional processing will allow you to feel more comfortable with other people\u2019s emotions, and it\u2019s not going to feel like receiving somebody else\u2019s emotions is automatically a criticism or something to be upset or dysregulated about,\u201d she advises.",
      "Hensley emphasizes the importance of being aware of your attachment style and not assuming incompatibility is the reason a relationship fails.",
      "\u201cWorking on your attachment and the things that come with insecure attachment, like your comfort with being vulnerable, your ability to process your emotions and your ability to stay objective is really important. But a lot of people just don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know,\u201d she says.",
      "If a partner\u2019s blueprint is dysfunctional, then their relationships will be negatively impacted.",
      "\u201cInvestigate attachment and focus on your own attachment security,\u201d she encourages. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the best way to have a healthy relationship in the future.\u201d"

      "During the interview with Variety, Carpenter denied the alternative cover was a concession to her critics. \u201cOh, girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to take more pictures!\u201d",
      "\"The (original cover) really says it all,\" she added, \"even though it\u2019s maybe not what you want me to say.\"",
      "In September, Carpenter told NPR she was \"surprised\" by the controversy sparked by her original cover.",
      "\"I think mostly because when I thought about making this album cover, I was really inspired by a man sort of delicately playing with my hair,\" she said. \"Because I think there were a lot of metaphors between this dog and me emotionally. You know, a man\u2019s best friend and sort of all the implications that that comes with it, the power in dominance and submission.",
      "\"When I saw it, obviously for me, it checked all the boxes in between my friends and family,\" she added at the time. \"It just felt like what the music sounds like.\""

      "After four years of dating, the couple recently got engaged, as confirmed by The New York Times.",
      "Cyrus, 33, showed off her engagement ring at the Los Angeles premiere of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" while posing on the red carpet with Morando, a 27-year-old music producer and drummer for the band Liily.",
      "Jacquie Aiche designed the ring, TODAY.com can confirm.",
      "The ring appears to feature a cushion-cut diamond between four and five carats, according to jewelry experts TODAY.com interviewed.",
      "Laura Taylor, a jeweler specializing in engagement and wedding rings at Lorel Diamonds, says cushion-cut diamonds have a \u201cromantic, vintage feel\u201d and are known for \u201csoft corners and broad facets that catch the light with flashes rather than sparkle.\u201d",
      "It's set in a chunky gold design, which Taylor says has been \"making a return\" among celebrities \u2013\u00a0see: Dua Lipa's recent engagement ring.",
      "The diamond is surrounded by gold, rather than set in prongs, also known as a bezel-style setting.",
      "\"Not only does this keep the stone more secure, but it also helps it stand out even more,\u201d Taylor notes.",
      "The pairing of a classic cushion-cut diamond with the bezel setting gives it a \"modern, sculptural look,\" which suits Cyrus' style, Taylor says.",
      "The ring aligns with Cyrus' brand and sense of style for other reasons, jewelers say.",
      "Ashleigh Bergman, the founder of Milestones by Ashleigh Bergman, says while the setting is classic, it's not \"classically bridal\" \u2014\u00a0which \"conversely makes it super modern.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s edgy (for bridal), but clean,\" she says.",
      "Page Neal, co-founder of Bario Neal, calls the ring \"modern, unfussy, bold, and deeply self-assured.\"",
      "\u201cIt has the feeling of a piece chosen for the present moment in her life, not an echo of the past,\u201d Neal says.",
      "Neal sees the ring speaking to various trends within the jewelry space, including a shift toward elongated shapes like ovals and marquises; east-west settings and the rise of low, wearable profiles.",
      "Jewelers who spoke to TODAY.com estimate the ring costing between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on factors like provenance of the stone, color, clarity and carat size.",
      "While speaking with People, Cyrus offered the following thoughts on her engagement.",
      "\u201cThe detail that I can share is that for us, our privacy and us kind of keeping it small has been something that I\u2019ve been astounded that I\u2019ve actually been able to have and being able to kind of have more choice,\u201d she says.",
      "Cyrus also explained why she thinks she and Morando have mostly been able to avoid the spotlight, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s also being older, being more protective of what I\u2019m open to sharing.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Europe faces \u201ccrunch time\u201d on the war in Ukraine, a former European president told NBC News, as the continent battles internal division, Russian threats and open hostility from the United States.",
      "Leaders on the continent are feeling \u201cgenuine fear and distrust regarding the United States,\u201d Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who led Estonia for a decade until 2016, told NBC News in an interview Thursday. But he also warned that Europe\u2019s internal division \u201cultimately shows the weakness\u201d of the bloc, and he feared what might happen \u201cunless we start getting our act together.\u201d",
      "His comments came hours before European powers held urgent negotiations Friday on how to keep Ukraine\u2019s war effort alive and before President Donald Trump published his National Security Strategy that spelled out in black and white Washington\u2019s dissatisfaction toward many of its partners across the pond.",
      "Trump had already left Europe out of this week\u2019s negotiations between his envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Finding itself sidelined, the European Union is trying to formulate its own proposal: using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort. Even that, however, is facing opposition from Belgium, fearing Russian retaliation.",
      "Putin on Thursday reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine \u201cby force\u201d unless his unwavering demands are met. He spoke after his predecessor, the hawkish Dmitry Medvedev, said using Russian money to aid Ukraine would be tantamount to a \u201ccasus belli\u201d \u2014 or an act justifying war \u2014 a common Kremlin refrain of his during the 45-month conflict.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time, I think, for Ukraine and for Europe,\u201d said Ilves, who served two stints as foreign minister before taking Estonia\u2019s top job.",
      "For Europe, this is about more than just Ukraine; they worry any peace that favors Putin will embolden him to attack and meddle elsewhere on the continent, which has seen an uptick in drone incursions and cyberattacks over the past year.",
      "His war machine is making slow progress on the battlefield but suffering heavy casualties. Kyiv, meanwhile, is running low on money and resources, while suffering a manpower shortage and facing allegations of governmental corruption."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 As smoke quickly filled the corridors of a 31-story tower in Hong Kong last week, Rhodora Alcaraz found herself trapped alone with a 3-month-old baby.",
      "The 28-year-old migrant worker had arrived in the Chinese territory from the Philippines only a day earlier to work for a family living in a high-rise housing estate. When a massive fire ignited in the middle of the afternoon, tearing across seven of the estate\u2019s eight buildings, Alcaraz shielded the baby in her arms and was rescued by firefighters just in time, along with her employer\u2019s elderly mother.",
      "Hong Kong, an international financial hub of 7.5 million people, is home to hundreds of thousands of domestic helpers like Alcaraz, mostly women from low-income Asian countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia.",
      "The bravery of Alcaraz and other domestic helpers during the Nov. 27 blaze at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po, which killed at least 159 people, has put a spotlight on the critical role they play in the city, where they work for low wages and often live in cramped homes alongside employers who heavily rely on them for housework and caregiving.",
      "At least 10 domestic helpers were killed in the fire, including nine from Indonesia and one from the Philippines.",
      "\u201cWe are truly grateful for their selflessness and also their heroic acts during the fire,\u201d Chris Sun, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for labor and welfare, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "He added that families of the domestic helpers who died will receive about 800,000 Hong Kong dollars ($100,000) in condolence and compensation payments.",
      "The Tai Po fire, the deadliest in Hong Kong in almost 80 years, has shocked and angered the public amid accusations of corrupt business practices and failures in government oversight. Authorities say the rapid spread of the five-alarm fire was caused by the use of highly flammable materials around the buildings during renovations.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, John Lee, said this week that a judge-led independent committee would be set up to \u201creview\u201d the fire, which displaced thousands of people from their homes. Almost two dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and fraud in separate investigations.",
      "Alcaraz was still recovering in the hospital and was seen wearing purple scrubs and a mask in a picture posted by Philippines Sen. Imee Marcos.",
      "\u201cI salute you, Rhodora, and all overseas foreign workers who continue to sacrifice for their families even while far from home,\u201d she said in a Facebook post Sunday after visiting Alcaraz in the hospital.",
      "While authorities and aid agencies announced several support measures for affected residents, including transitional housing and a donor-supported reconstruction fund that has raised about 2.8 billion Hong Kong dollars ($360 million), the fire creates additional uncertainty for domestic helpers, who live in Hong Kong on dedicated visas and are entitled to far fewer rights than a typical resident.",
      "A helper\u2019s salary starts at about $650 a month.",
      "Even with an additional food allowance of about $160, they still earn below the minimum wage in Hong Kong, which at about $5.40 an hour amounts to $860 a month for a 40-hour workweek. They are also ineligible for permanent residency, which in most cases can be obtained by living in the city for seven years.",
      "Many domestic helpers are mothers themselves, sending most of their earnings to their children back home to support their education.",
      "\u201cThey have deep trauma now. Whenever they pass by the building, they always cry. Some had friends who died in that building,\u201d said Sring Sringatin, a domestic helper in Hong Kong who is chair of the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union.",
      "Sringatin said helpers from Wang Fuk Court were still residing with their employers, either in temporary shelters or alternative housing. Previously, they would often share a room with the family\u2019s children. Now that their employers are homeless, accommodating helpers has become even more difficult, according to Sringatin and other aid workers who have met with affected helpers.",
      "It is also unclear whether employers whose homes have been destroyed will be able to pay their salaries on time, even as the workers \u2014 who are so embedded with families that they often act as the primary caregivers to children and elderly relatives \u2014 continue providing care.",
      "\u201cThey just follow the families if there is care to be given,\u201d said Johannie Tong, a community relations officer for the nonprofit group Mission for Migrant Workers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a default for them. The disaster has happened, but they are still working. They don\u2019t have this question, whether I should work,\u201d said Tong, who visited some of the displaced workers over the past week in government-run temporary shelters that journalists could not access.",
      "Before the fire, workers got little time to themselves. In most cases they worked six days a week, meeting fellow workers on Sundays at parks and other public places to sing karaoke, do each other\u2019s nails or enjoy picnics. Now they are not only traumatized, but they may also be facing more pressure at work and feeling isolated at a time when they are far away from their families, Tong and Sringatin said.",
      "\u201cThey are trying their best to perform their duties, but at the same time they need to be strong, because as a domestic worker there is this feeling that they don\u2019t have anyone in here,\u201d Sringatin said.",
      "Tong said her charity was trying to determine what kind of long-term help workers might need, including immigration assistance or support for their families back home. In the short term, she said, there are ample donations at their center in Hong Kong\u2019s Jordan neighborhood, where workers on Monday were sorting through clothes, toiletries, medicines and more.",
      "Mission for Migrant Workers said it had obtained a SIM card for Alcaraz to use to communicate with her family back in the Philippines.",
      "\u201cSince she hasn\u2019t recovered her voice yet, she just gave a thumbs-up and smiled to express her joy and appreciation,\u201d the charity said Wednesday."

    "story": [
      "After a quiet start, the first American pope appears to be finding his voice.",
      "During his debut foreign trip, to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV projected a papal brand more guarded and less polarizing than that of his predecessor, Pope Francis.",
      "But many Vatican watchers have nonetheless been impressed with his ability to deliver powerful messages \u2014 particularly on issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence, poverty and immigration \u2014 albeit in a subtler way than the man he replaced.",
      "\u201cPope Leo is certainly growing into the role,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a world-leading Vatican expert and professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cHe has resisted the temptation to give a sound bite that\u2019s easy to use as a headline,\u201d but \u201cwhen he speaks, he says things that are quite courageous.\u201d",
      "For all the warm reviews, some Vatican watchers have sounded a note of caution: Leo has yet to stake out concrete positions, let alone sharp critiques, on any major issue. Doing so will almost certainly mean disappointing at least one faction in this church of 1.4 billion that he has so deftly kept onside.",
      "Raised in Chicago, Leo, 70, spent much of his working life in Peru, before he was a surprise choice for pope at April\u2019s conclave following the death of Francis. His lower profile meant \u201che was a bit of a mystery\u201d for many Catholics, and he had \u201ca very quiet summer\u201d of study and preparation, Faggioli said.",
      "That started to change as the colder months arrived, with more outspoken comments including his call last month for \u201cdeep reflection\u201d about the treatment of detained migrants in the United States.",
      "On Tuesday, as he held a Mass in Beirut, which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Leo honored a promise made by Francis, who was prevented from visiting by his late-life illness.",
      "Leo asked \u201cGod for the gift of peace for this beloved land, marked by instability, wars and suffering,\u201d likely a reference to the recent Israel-Hezbollah war, the fallout from a colossal portside explosion in 2020 that killed more than 200 people, and the country\u2019s roiling economic crisis.",
      "Though more than half of the Lebanese population is Muslim, nearly one third are Christian and 5% Catholic, according to 2022 census data. Before Lebanon, Leo visited Turkey to mark the anniversary of the foundation of the Nicene Creed, the standard statement of what all Christians \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox \u2014 believe, including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God.",
      "That highlighted one of the themes of the six-day trip, which was reaching out \u201cboth to other Christian groups, but also to the government of Turkey, and, by extension, to Muslims,\u201d according to Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church who teaches at the University of Oxford.",
      "That\u2019s just one of the ways Leo has followed Francis\u2019 relatively progressive policies and views \u2014 \u201cbut he\u2019s done so with a very different tone and in a different way,\u201d Pattenden said.",
      "Though both men warned against the risks associated with AI, the tech-savvy Leo is the first pontiff \u201cwho seems at ease with the modern world\u201d and pop culture, Pattenden added.",
      "His down-to-earth vibe makes his papacy seem like \u201ca sitcom in which some nice geek from the Midwest in America suddenly found that he had become pope,\u201d Pattenden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got this smile that suggests he himself can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d",
      "Leo is known to read his speeches word-for-word, a drastic departure from Francis\u2019 habit of going off script. That led to several high-profile faux pas that sent his aides into damage limitation mode.",
      "\u201cTheir gestures and outreach are similar,\u201d said Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cBut Pope Francis was quite evidently gregarious and extroverted in nature, whereas the reserved Pope Leo seems quite effective though in communication and has clarity in his thought.\u201d",
      "Even when sticking to his lines, Francis\u2019 pointed and specific pronouncements led to clashes with other world officials, like when he challenged the U.S. on climate change and called for an investigation into whether Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.",
      "Leo has said he supports the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian territories but told reporters on the plane to Lebanon that \u201cwe are friends with Israel.\u201d",
      "During his trip this week, Leo \u201cspoke and acted very carefully, as if every sentence had been carefully weighted and coined, to avoid misunderstanding or blunt declaration,\u201d said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute.",
      "And the new pope was well received by many in Lebanon, a country still being bombed by Israel. Just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "\u201cWe think he will bring for us peace, love and hope,\u201d said Pascale Azaz, a nurse watching Leo\u2019s address next to Beirut\u2019s shimmering waterfront Tuesday, the last day of his trip. \u201cWe have been waiting years for this day.\u201d",
      "Nearby, Moussa Abdayem, a yoga instructor, said he hoped the pope \u201cwill inspire us to live in a more peaceful way\u201d in a country where \u201ceverybody\u2019s angry\u201d at the swirling crises besetting his nation.",
      "They aren\u2019t the only ones impressed by Leo\u2019s approach. His centrist stance appears to have calmed divisions between Catholic liberals and conservatives, some of the latter enraged by what they saw as Francis\u2019 abandonment of liturgical traditions such as the Latin mass.",
      "However, occupying such a middle ground does not come without risks.",
      "The closest Leo came to criticism or censure of anyone or anything was making \u201ca heartfelt appeal to those who hold political and social authority, here and in all countries marked by war and violence.\u201d",
      "He told them, \"Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace!\u201d"

Miled Abboud is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV\u2019s visit to the blast site Tuesday will highlight the amount of rebuilding that still needs to be done. He also believes Leo's visit will bring \u201ca message of hope\u201d and reconciliation between Lebanon\u2019s diverse Christian communities \u2014 a large number of whom have left in recent years \u2014 and coexistence with the majority Muslim population.",
      "\u201cThe pope\u2019s visit is a sign of hope,\u201d Abboud told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cThere are a lot of bleak things, of things that make us despair, but we have Christ who gives us strength to carry on.\u201d",
      "Abboud, who said he had only been a priest at this Maronite church for a few months, added that he hoped to restore it to its former glory to inspire the local community, although many younger members of his congregation have left the city or country altogether, largely because of the dire economy.",
      "\u201cThe majority of young people have moved to other regions or to the Gulf, to Europe, to France, because we have a lot of French universities here, so once they finish their studies, people move to France,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of them took the decision to leave in the aftermath of the massive August 2020 port explosion, which tore through Beirut after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse, according to Paul Salem, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "In total, 218 people were killed and 7,000 others wounded by the blast which devastated large swaths of the city, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "Much of the destruction was in \u201cmajority Christian neighborhoods of east Beirut,\u201d Salem said in a series of voice notes Monday. For some it was \u201cthe last straw,\u201d he added.",
      "As much as people loved their homeland, he said, the explosion \u201ctraumatized so many\u201d in the country, which was already reeling from an economic collapse and struggling to cope with an influx of around 1.5 million refugees who crossed into Lebanon as civil war-ravaged neighboring Syria. Some have returned to their country since the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year.",
      "Pointing out that members of Christian populations have a long history of migration \u201cfrom the Middle East to the West from the 19th century,\u201d Salem said \u201cthey were attracted to and feel comfortable going to the West, which is generally Christian.\u201d",
      "But, he said, both Christians and Muslims had left during the civil war which wracked the country between 1975 and 1990 and the war with Israel in 2006.",
      "After the economic collapse, he said, \u201cthere weren\u2019t great jobs in Lebanon but there were in Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Riyadh or further afield in Canada or the U.S.\u201d Others had left to pursue higher education in the West, he added.",
      "More recently, the country has been rocked by the spillover of Israel's war in Gaza and also the war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah until a fragile ceasefire was brokered around a year ago.",
      "But just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "Elsewhere, some Syrian Christians have left their country amid concerns about the new government under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, former leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In June, an unprecedented terrorist attack in Damascus on the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church during Mass killed at least 30 people and injured 54.",
      "Large numbers had already fled the country, as well as neighboring Iraq, after the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, declared a caliphate.",
      "In Gaza, the small surviving Christian community has seen churches shelled and worshippers killed during Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, while in the occupied West Bank, Christian communities have been targeted by Israeli settlers and the economy has suffered as tourists' numbers have dropped dramatically.",
      "While Lebanese Christians have lived in relative peace in the Muslim-majority country, the country\u2019s dire economic situation has led many to seek a new life abroad.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to leave their home, especially if their home has been passed down for thousands of years and people have fought for that home to stay there. But we also want to live here with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lteif, 21, told NBC News in an interview Saturday.",

      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we are facing is how many Christians have left,\u201d Charbel Lteif said, adding that with their videos they were trying to raise awareness and preserve their culture and traditions by creating \u201ca new voice for the Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, a voice that is not political, a voice that is not for anyone\u2019s agenda, a voice that is from the Christians of the East to the whole world.\u201d",
      "Charbel Lteif said churches were \u201cstill very alive,\u201d in Lebanon which has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East, making up over a third of the population.",
      "A power sharing agreement has been in place since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943 in which the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker is a Shia Muslim and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim.",
      "This makes Lebanon the only Arab country with a Christian head of state, a tradition that continued earlier this year when President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet were elected on reformist platforms and vowed to hold those behind the port explosion to account.",
      "Five years on from the blast, no official has been convicted, and years of obstructions by top officials have stalled an investigation and hampered hopes for justice.",
      "With no centralized effort by the Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods, many families and business owners used their own money to fix their properties or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "At St. Anthony of Padua, Abboud remained hopeful that it would be restored to its former glory.",
      "\u201cWhen the church is closed, it means we\u2019ve lost a piece of our region,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this as a Christian who truly believes we have a mission with our Muslim brothers: a mission of dialogue, a mission of coexistence, of making peace.\u201d"

      "The body of just one Israeli hostage remains in Gaza, nearing the fulfillment of a key plank of President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point ceasefire plan for the enclave, but major hurdles exist to a planned second phase.",
      "Doubts remain over whether negotiators can overcome those obstacles, even as they face renewed pressure to advance into Phase 2 \u2014 a step intended to prevent any return to the high levels of violence that preceded the ceasefire.",
      "Trump noted last week that Phase 2 would commence \u201cpretty soon,\u201d without giving a more specific timetable. Axios reported Thursday that the White House is hoping to announce the second phase before Christmas and unveil the new governance structure for the enclave, citing two U.S. officials and a Western source directly involved in the process.",
      "Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s plan calls for the establishment of a new governing mechanism in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the formation of an international stabilization force, known as the ISF, that would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has played a key role in a series of international negotiations, said Saturday that discussions were at a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Mediators were working jointly to push the next phase of the ceasefire forward, he said during a panel at the Doha Forum conference in Qatar.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, [until] there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\u201d he said.",
      "Egypt\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told the conference that the international stabilization force was needed \u201cas soon as possible on the ground,\u201d while Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said measures must be put in place this month, warning the current ceasefire \u201ccannot hold for many more weeks in its current phase.\u201d",
      "As the international community hopes for progress, the ceasefire\u2019s trajectory so far underscores both its fragile gains and its persistent vulnerabilities.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect on Oct. 10, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel. The body of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has yet to be recovered despite a weekslong search effort. Israeli authorities have steadily released Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 as part of the exchange.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said all hostages must be returned before a Phase 2 deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week stressing the need for an \u201cintensive and immediate effort\u201d to complete the commitment.",
      "Israel agreed to halt its assault on the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, but flare-ups and violence have persisted, with Israeli strikes killing more than 350 people since the ceasefire began, taking the death toll in the enclave beyond 70,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.",
      "The first phase also included a commitment to expand the flow of aid into Gaza, but U.N. experts say the number of trucks permitted to enter has never reached the agreed target of 600 per day.",
      "Israel said Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing in the south will soon reopen to allow Palestinians to enter Egypt, but it will not reopen the crossing in both directions \u2014 another commitment under the deal \u2014 until Gvili\u2019s remains are returned.",
      "And as Phase 1 sputters along, analysts warn that Phase 2 presents a host of complex challenges, from security arrangements to competing governance demands, that could slow or even stall the process.",
      "Negotiators are \u201ctrying to square circles that simply cannot be squared,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "He wondered whether an international stabilization force could really dismantle Hamas, a target Israel was unable to achieve through two years of a \u201cbrutal\u201d military operation. While Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that Hamas will disarm, the group has reasserted control of Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire and shown no immediate signs of disarmament.",
      "Disarming Hamas through military intervention is \u201cnot exactly something that any other power is going to be interested in,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "And when it comes to Gaza\u2019s governance, Hellyer added, \u201cTrump can create his board of peace,\u201d referring to the group that would sit atop Gaza\u2019s governing structure under Trump\u2019s plan, but \u201cyou can\u2019t simply enforce this stuff on the ground without cooperation from the population, unless you just want to turn it into a new type of occupation.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that negotiations over the Gaza stabilization force remain ongoing, including its mandate and rules of engagement, and that its main objective should be to separate Israelis and Palestinians along the border.",
      "\u201cThousands of details, questions are in place,\u201d Fidan said. \u201cI think once we deploy ISF, the rest will come.\u201d",
      "But Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, echoed Hellyer\u2019s concerns, noting that so far, \u201cno state has agreed to support its forces into Gaza and potentially and ultimately get into confrontation with Hamas.\u201d",
      "Gerges also feared that \u201cwe will never see the actual implementation of what Phase 2 is supposed to be,\u201d adding it was \u201can illusion\u201d to call what\u2019s happening in Gaza a ceasefire, \u201cbecause the Palestinians, particularly civilians, continue to be killed on a daily basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though the humanitarian situation of the Palestinians has improved a bit, it\u2019s still catastrophic,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Navy on Thursday released the results of its investigation into four incidents involving the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group during its deployment to the Middle East in late 2024 through earlier this year.",
      "The incidents, which occurred between December 2024 and May 2025, involved the loss of three F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets in the Red Sea and a collision between the carrier and a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt.",
      "The investigation found that a trip wire failure, poor computer signaling, \u201csubstandard maintenance practices\u201d and \u201coverall low-level knowledge\u201c among some of the carrier group\u2019s personnel contributed to the incidents, according to the report on the investigation. In December 2024, an accidental \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident involving two F/A-18s, where one was downed and the other was nearly missed, appeared to have occurred in part because of faulty combat systems, the report said.",
      "In April 2024, a fighter jet and a tow tractor were lost because of a maneuver the carrier made to try to avoid incoming fire from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the report said.",
      "As a result of the findings, the Navy is reviewing some systems and operations and will conduct more personnel training to try to prevent such incidents, according to the recommendations made in the investigation findings.",
      "\u201cThe Navy is committed to being a learning organization,\u201d the vice chief of naval operations, Adm. Jim Kilby, said in a written statement provided by the Navy.",
      "The Navy has said there were no personnel casualties or major injuries related to the incidents.",
      "The Navy\u2019s report said its investigation found that a December 2024 \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident involving the shooting down of an F/A-18F Super Hornet by the USS Gettysburg, a guided-missile cruiser, was caused by a \u201clack of integrated training opportunities between USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser, and lack of cohesion across the Carrier Strike Group.\u201d",
      "That lack of cohesion \u201ccontributed to the misidentification, and subsequent engagement, of the friendly aircraft and near miss of another,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThe investigation for the F-18 loss in December 2024 was determined that a lack of reintegrated training opportunities between the USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group contributed to the misidentification and subsequent engagement of the US Navy aircraft,\u201d Kilby said. \u201cThis was manifested through not following procedures, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser and lack of cohesion across Strike Group units.\u201d",
      "Before the incident, the Truman had spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d defending against Houthi-launched anti-ship cruise missiles and one-way attack drones, the report said.",
      "The investigation also found that the USS Truman\u2019s February 2025 collision with a merchant vessel was \u201cavoidable,\u201d according to the report. The team aboard the Truman failed to safely navigate past the vessel.",
      "In addition, an April 2025 incident involving the loss of an F/A-18E Super Hornet and tow tractor was due to evasive maneuvers that the Truman took while responding to an incoming ballistic missile in the Red Sea, the report said. The investigation determined the aircraft brake system failed, in addition to \u201cinsufficient communication between the bridge, flight deck control, and hangar bay control.\u201d",
      "The investigation also found that a May 2025 incident involving another F/A-18 was caused by a failure of the trip wire aboard the USS Truman. Among the reasons, according to the report, were \u201csubstandard maintenance practices, substandard arresting gear, leadership and overall low-level knowledge\u201d among the personnel operating the trip wire."

      "The proposed penalty nearly two years in the making came after regulators said in late 2023 that they had opened proceedings into X over suspected failure to combat content disinformation and manipulation. X was the first company to face such an investigation when the probe started.",
      "At the start, regulators said the proceedings were about several issues including the alleged dissemination of illegal content \u201cin the context of Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel\u201d and a suspicion that X had a \u201cdeceptive design\u201d in how it handed out blue verification checks to paying users.",
      "Musk, the wealthiest person in the world by some measures, has had rocky relations with European leaders even aside from the investigation into X. In January, the leaders of four European countries, including France and Germany, denounced his influence and warned that Musk should not involve himself in their nations\u2019 domestic politics.",
      "Musk, a former close ally of President Donald Trump, has helped to fuel a wave of far-right candidates across Europe and the globe, although many of his candidates have fallen short of winning power.",
      "X could appeal the commission\u2019s findings in European courts.",
      "In April, after rumors spread that the commission was on the verge of issuing a penalty against X, the company said it was prepared to fight.",
      "\u201cIf the reports that the European Commission is considering enforcement actions against X are accurate, it represents an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech,\u201d the company said in a post on X.",

      "Usually known more for pop anthems and extravagant costumes than for political disagreements, the Eurovision Song Contest is facing a major boycott after a push to eject Israel from the contest was rejected.",
      "National broadcasters from Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands all said they would not take part in the 2026 contest, citing Israel\u2019s continued participation in the contest amid the war in Gaza.",
      "In public statements on Thursday, Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS cited the \u201chumanitarian suffering in Gaza\u201d and alleged \u201cpolitical interference\u201d in the contest, while Ireland\u2019s RT\u00c9 said its continued participation was \u201cunconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there.\u201d",
      "Alfonso Morales, secretary-general of Spanish broadcaster RTVE, said \u201cthe situation in Gaza, despite the ceasefire and the approval of the peace process, and Israel\u2019s use of the contest for political purposes, make it increasingly difficult to maintain Eurovision as a neutral cultural event.\u201d",

      "Germany, one of the contest\u2019s biggest funders, had threatened to withdraw if Israel was excluded. Its participating broadcaster SWR expressed \"deep regret\" at the boycott but said a vote on excluding Israel was \u201cnot required\u201d as it welcomed other changes to the contest\u2019s rules.

      "The EBU\u2019s own independent news service, citing Google advertising transparency data, reported in May that advertisements from the Israeli government ran across Europe encouraging supporters to \u201cvote up to 20 times\u201d for Raphael.",

      "Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said the contest would also \u201cstrengthen enforcement of our existing rules to prevent any misuse of the Contest for example through song lyrics or staging.\u201d",
      "In its statement, KAN denied it was \u201cinvolved in any prohibited campaign intended to influence the results of the latest contest.\u201d",

      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that despite the absence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 believed to be the first time in 22 years that America's top diplomat did not attend a ministerial gathering of this kind \u2014 he remained \"very much involved\" in the process.",
      "Rutte later told journalists that President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts were central to ending the war.",
      "\u201cThere is only one person in the whole world who was able to break the deadlock ... and that is the American president,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Trump said at a gathering of reporters Wednesday that special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner had a good meeting with Putin on Tuesday.",
      "\"What comes out of that meeting? I can\u2019t tell you, because it does take two to tango,\" Trump said.",
      "He added: \"Their impression was that they\u2019d like to, he would like to see the war ended. I think he\u2019d like to get back to dealing a more normal life. I think I\u2019d like to be trading with the United States of America, frankly, instead of losing thousands of soldiers a week. But their impression was very strongly that he\u2019d like to make a deal.\"",
      "Following the meeting with Putin in Moscow, Witkoff and Kushner invited Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, to a meeting in Miami on Thursday, a senior U.S. official told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Umerov accepted, the official said, and negotiations for a potential peace deal will continue in Florida on Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X that world powers need to keep pressuring Russia about the conflict.",
      "\"Right now, the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war, and current diplomatic activity in negotiations must be backed by pressure on Russia,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everything depends on this combination \u2014 constructive diplomacy plus pressure on the aggressor. Both components work toward peace.\"",

      "European leaders were also blindsided by Trump\u2019s 28-point plan last month, which was seen as leaving not just Ukraine, but also the whole continent vulnerable.",
      "Rubio's absence from the summit was \"unusual,\" said William Alberque, NATO's former arms control director. The last time he could remember such an absence was when Colin Powell was absent in 2003, which was attributed to the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.",
      "Asked why Rubio would not meet with NATO allies, especially during the ongoing Ukraine war negotiations, a senior State Department official told NBC News that he \"has already attended dozens of meetings with NATO allies, and it would be completely impractical to expect him at every meeting.\"",
      "Despite having been sidelined in discussions between Moscow and Washington, European leaders could still have \"a direct impact on the talks\" and \"continue to guide the process,\" Alberque said.",
      "He added that \"it may seem that the Europeans are powerless in the face of Trump\u2019s style of leadership\" but that \"we already have seen the so-called 'peace plan' change radically over the past days, with Ukrainian and European concerns increasingly reflected.\"",
      "Before he met with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday, Putin launched into a tirade against Europe, criticizing European leaders for hindering Trump\u2019s peace efforts, from which, he said, Europe has removed itself. Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, he told reporters, but if Europe starts a war, there can be no doubt about Russia\u2019s readiness to respond \u201cright now.\u201d",
      "Stefan Wolff, a professor of international security at England\u2019s University of Birmingham, said Putin's rhetoric was part of the Russian narrative that Europe is undermining Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war and that if it weren't for European obstruction, a deal would long ago have been done.",
      "\"That is probably true, but it's a good thing, because any such deal would be bad for Ukraine, bad for Europe and ultimately bad for the U.S.,\u201d he said.",

Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the talks were the first such \u201cdirect exchange of opinions,\u201d adding that Putin did not reject the U.S. plan.",

      "Nearly four years after Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of his smaller neighbor, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are grappling with an empowered Russia, with Ukraine on the back foot both on and off the battlefield. Kyiv\u2019s troops, facing a dire manpower crisis, cling to strategic hubs, and a major corruption scandal has shaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government and forced the resignation of his top negotiator.",
      "Kyiv and its allies view Witkoff, the man whom Washington has sent to negotiate with Putin this week, with suspicion after a leaked phone call suggested he was advising Moscow on how to deal with Trump, according to a transcript published by Bloomberg News.",
      "Ushakov said in the Kremlin video that the meeting Tuesday was \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations. \u201cWe specifically discussed territorial issues, without which we see no resolution to the crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "Witkoff presented the Russians with several documents. \u201cThere was a document containing 27 points. We naturally reviewed it. However, we didn\u2019t work on the wording, and there were no discussions with our American colleagues about it,\u201d Ushakov said, noting that the Americans gave the Russians four additional documents.",
      "He added: \u201cA compromise hasn\u2019t been found yet, but some American proposals seem more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed. Some of the language we\u2019ve been offered is acceptable. The work will continue. It is indeed one of the most important questions.\u201d",
      "Ushakov said that contacts would continue \u201cat the level of representatives, aides and other representatives, in particular with these two people who arrived in the Kremlin today,\u201d but that no meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled.",
      "Asked by a journalist whether an end to the conflict was now closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow. This has been agreed upon, and contacts will continue.\u201d",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired  Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was necessary to push both sides to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis has now become a war of attrition, and sadly, the Russians have shown their willingness to sacrifice 7,000 soldiers a week in an effort to achieve this,\u201d Rubio said.",

      "From Ukraine\u2019s perspective, acceding to most of Russia\u2019s demands would set it up for a third invasion, \u201cafter 2014 and 2022,\u201d Horowitz added, referring to Russia\u2019s military backing of separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east in 2014 and the full-scale invasion eight years later.",
      "The 'three pillars'",
      "Putin has never hidden his hard-line demands.",
      "He has sought the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial region of Donbas, comprising the contested Donetsk region and Russian-controlled Luhansk. (Russia holds about one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory.) He has also called for Ukraine to be \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d essentially rendering it defenseless, and a final peace settlement to be acknowledged in international law.",
      "\u201cThere are three pillars on which we will not compromise,\u201d a Russian official briefed on the matter said on condition of anonymity. \u201cOne is the territory of the Donbas. The second is a limit on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The third is the recognition of territory by America and Europe.\u201d",
      "Moscow is prepared to be flexible on certain secondary issues, the official said this week, like hundreds of billions in Russian assets frozen in Europe at the beginning of the war. Ukraine and its European allies have called for the funds to be used to boost Ukraine\u2019s shattered economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan envisions that roughly one-third of the frozen assets, or $100 billion, would be invested in the U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine. According to the original leaked 28-point plan, the U.S. would receive 50% of the profits from the venture. No specific details have been released about the plan that was whittled down to 20 points during Sunday\u2019s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.",
      "Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, told NBC News he thinks Putin could be willing to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand is he can\u2019t afford to fall out with Trump. It would be quite suicidal,\u201d Gallyamov said. And while the war has not devastated the Russian economy, in the long term Putin understands that ramped-up sanctions by Trump would make economic recovery very difficult, if not impossible, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump will really press him, Putin will agree to end the fighting \u2014 maybe with the calculation that he will build up strength, quickly organize some sort of provocation in the spring to blame on the Ukrainians and hit again,\u201d Gallyamov said.",
      "A lot depends on what the Americans demand, Gallyamov said, adding that Putin may be willing to agree to a ceasefire over Christmas and New Year\u2019s.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last chance for Russia to convince Witkoff, and Witkoff must convince Trump that the Russian view is the correct one,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister.",
      "Putin has signaled for months, even before the diplomatic flurry caused by Trump\u2019s 28-point proposal, that he was willing to continue fighting.",
      "In September, he said he welcomed \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s peace efforts in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation develops,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll have to resolve all the challenges we face militarily.\u201d",
      "He reiterated that last week, saying fighting would stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold. \u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d he said.",
      "The leaked 28-point plan would force Ukraine to cede territory, including land it holds in the Donetsk region. It would limit the Ukrainian army to 600,000, down from more than 800,000 currently. It would also bar Ukraine from ever joining the NATO defense alliance \u2014 which Kyiv has said is a nonstarter.",
      "But according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, even the leaked plan did not go far enough for Putin.",
      "The 600,000-personnel limit the plan would impose on the Ukrainian army is one sticking point, she wrote in an analysis last week. It would still leave Kyiv with the largest army in Europe.",
      "The draft plan also did not include a total ban on long-range weapons in Ukraine, she added.",
      "The wording is also important for Putin, Stanovaya said. Putin indicated last week that he would want every word of any peace agreement to be carefully weighed, having mocked the language of the original proposal as undiplomatic and, at times, \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "If he could write his own version of the peace plan, Horowitz said, Putin would legally claim all four Ukrainian provinces he illegally annexed in 2022, not just Donetsk and Luhansk; reduce Ukraine\u2019s army to one-tenth of its current size; complete the so-called denazification of Ukraine, which is code for a Russian say in Ukraine\u2019s future and removal of nationalist parties; and lift all sanctions.",
      "While Putin does not necessarily think those demands would be achievable, Horowitz said, he thinks the final deal should be closer to his ideal peace than that of Ukraine's \u2014 and he is prepared to wait if that\u2019s not the case.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is that this \u2018ideal deal\u2019 means Russia will be encouraged to invade Ukraine again \u2014 beyond what it already occupies,\u201d he added.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Moscow, and Yuliya Talmazan from London."

      "A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump's envoy and his son-in-law lasted five hours Tuesday but ended without clear progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russian officials called the meeting with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow \"constructive\" and \"productive.\" But neither side released details of how the talks might bridge the chasm between Russia's unwavering demands and the assurances sought by Ukraine and its frozen-out European backers.",
      "Beforehand, Putin called Europe's attempts to influence the U.S.-led peace talks \"absolutely unacceptable\" and said that while he did not want war with Europe, Russia was ready for one if necessary. Sidelined European powers were meeting Wednesday at a NATO summit in Belgium, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio took the rare step of skipping the summit altogether.",
      "Putin's foreign adviser Yuri Ushakov called Tuesday's meeting \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations.",
      "Russian officials had reviewed a number of documents presented by the American delegation, and that some proposals \"seem more-or-less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Asked whether an end to the conflict was closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow.\"",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was  \"waiting for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia,\" adding that it was important \"everything is fair and transparent and that \"there are no games played behind Ukraine's back.\"",

      "Ukraine and Europe say they are concerned about being sidelined in the negotiations that will directly influence their safety and security on the continent. There are widespread fears that a favorable deal for Putin will embolden him to attack elsewhere.",
      "A leaked 28-point plan the U.S. proposed last month was widely deemed as capitulating to Russia. It would have forced Kyiv to cede its territories to Moscow, including the land that it currently controls. It would have limited the size of Kyiv\u2019s army and barred Ukraine from ever joining NATO.",
      "The proposal blindsided Kyiv, which launched a storm of negotiations in Europe and the U.S. to try to amend the plan and make it more palatable to Ukraine.",
      "It comes as Zelenskyy\u2019s government is on the back foot on the battlefield, while rocked by a major corruption scandal. His powerful chief of staff and top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, resigned last week after being implicated in the probe.",
      "Shortly before his scheduled meeting with the American delegation, Putin addressed an investment forum where he said his army held the advantage in Ukraine, while criticizing European leaders for hindering the peace process.",
      "Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, but if Europe starts a war, Russia is ready \u201cright now,\u201d Putin told reporters. \"If Europe suddenly wants to start a war with us and does, then we could quickly get a situation in which we have no one to negotiate with.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022 in what has become Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Despite Russia expecting Ukraine to surrender in a matter of days, the war has dragged on. The Ukrainian army, backed by Western weapons, has managed to not only resist the onslaught, but also counterattack. Still, Russian forces are now in control of roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.",
      "The Russian leader signaled last week that he was ready for a \u201cserious\u201d discussion with the U.S. and said that a version of the plan that was agreed during talks with Ukrainian officials in Geneva last month could form the \u201cframework\u201d of a final peace settlement. Still, he said his army had the upper hand on the battlefield and if no agreement was reached, he would get what he wanted by force.",
      "Wearing a military uniform, Putin received reports from his generals Monday that Russian troops have completely \u201cliberated\u201d the city of Pokrovsk, an important Ukrainian transport and supply hub in the Donetsk region. Ukraine denied reports that the city was entirely under Russian control. Pokrovsk\u2019s capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger cities and the whole region.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House confirmed Monday that the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September and that it was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.",
      "\u201cAdm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" she added.",
      "U.S. Special Operations Command, which Bradley now leads as commander, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Washington Post reported that Bradley had ordered the second strike, and that he was complying with an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \u201ckill everybody.\u201d NBC News has not confirmed the detail about Hegseth.",
      "One U.S. official and a source familiar with the Pentagon\u2019s actions on Sept. 2 told NBC News recently that the first of the two strikes conducted that day left at least two survivors, with the subsequent strike killing them.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post Monday night, also indicated that Bradley ordered the second strike. \"Let\u2019s make one thing crystal clear: Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",
      "On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Hegseth didn't order the second strike.",
      "\"He said he didn't do it,\" said Trump, who also said he didn't know if the second strike even happened.

I\u2019m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Asked Monday what law the U.S. military relied on to justify the second strike, Leavitt said: \u201cThe strike conducted on Sept. 2 was conducted in self-defense to protect Americans in vital United States interests. The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d",
      "She also confirmed that Trump would be meeting with his national security team \u2014 which includes Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller \u2014 in the Oval Office later Monday. A senior White House official confirmed Monday night that the meeting had wrapped.",

      "Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash. \u2014 said they were taking \"seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\"",
      "Smith told reporters Monday night that he would be receiving a classified briefing this week from Bradley about the strikes. He added that it would be \"helpful\" to have Hegseth testify.",
      "The details of the briefing with Bradley are still being worked out, Smith said, but he indicated that they are aiming for it to take place Thursday.",
      "Bradley is expected to be in Washington this week to speak with senior lawmakers about the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "Wicker, who also said he will be speaking with Bradley, said Monday that he has spoken with Hegseth about the second strike. The defense secretary is also expected to have spoken or is soon speaking with other lawmakers, according to two other people familiar with matter.",
      "Wicker and Smith both said they have spoken with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Hegseth has defended the numerous U.S. strikes in the Caribbean, saying in a post on X Friday after The Washington Post article was published that \"these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be 'lethal, kinetic strikes.'\"",
      "\"Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict \u2014 and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,\" he wrote.",

      "The strikes in the Caribbean are part of an escalating pressure campaign the Trump administration is waging against Venezuela. Trump declared in a Truth Social post Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"closed,\" which came as the U.S. is considering military action against the South American nation."
