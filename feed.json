      "LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children\u2019s books including classics like \u201cEat Peach Pear Plum\u201d and \u201cThe Jolly Postman,\u201d has died, his publisher said Friday. He was 87.",
      "Penguin Random House said Ahlberg died on Tuesday. It did not give a cause of death.",
      "Ahlberg\u2019s books introduced generations of young children to reading through simple rhymes, sharp observation and gentle humor. Many were co-created with his illustrator wife Janet Ahlberg, who died in 1994.",
      "\u201cPeepo!\u201d (1981) gave a baby\u2019s-eye-view of the world and was interactive in a delightfully analogue way, with peep-holes in the pages to spy the next scenes.",
      "\u201cThe Jolly Postman\u201d (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it \u201cpushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.\u201d",
      "Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including \u201cThe Ha Ha Bonk Book,\u201d and poetry for primary school-age children, including \u201cPlease Mrs. Butler\u201d and \u201cHeard it in the Playground.\u201d",
      "Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a \u201cpostman, plumber\u2019s mate and grave digger,\u201d according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. He met Janet at teacher training college and the couple\u2019s first book, \u201cHere are the Brick Street Boys,\u201d was published in 1975.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs could face a prison sentence \u201csubstantially higher\u201d than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.",
      "They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing.",
      "In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.",
      "Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range \u201cwill be substantially higher,\u201d raising the risk Combs will flee.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.",
      "On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.",
      "Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \u201clack of danger to any person or the community.\u201d But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.",
      "In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.",

As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,\u201d Agnifilo wrote earlier this week.",
      "Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.",
      "Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.",
      "\u201cThe defendant's extensive history of violence \u2014 and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct \u2014 demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.\u201d",

In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",

      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "\u201cSeveral artists featured on the film\u2019s soundtrack, which includes works from real-life blues, folk and country musicians, saw spikes the week of the film\u2019s theatrical release,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all enjoying a sustained rise in listenership even two-plus months following release.\u201d",
      "Guy has noticed the shift, too. \u201cI walk in the grocery store or the drugstore and people recognize me. \u2018Man, you know, I heard that \u2019Sinners' music, man. Man, it sounds good,'\u201d he says. \u201cThey ain\u2019t never gonna come in and say, \u2018I heard it on the radio.\u2019\u201d",
      "That's part of the reason why Guy decided to participate in the movie in the first place. \u201cI hope this will give the blues a boost, because my worry right now is, like I said, a young person don\u2019t know how good a gumbo is \u2014 you\u2019ve got to taste it.\u201d",

      "\"The Bad Guys 2\" hits theaters, and it's a wild ride",
      "The good news for fans of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d is the new sequel is stellar. But that's because a good portion is actually set in \u2014 are you kidding us? \u2014 outer space. \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d has clearly lost its moorings.",
      "Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days \u2014 amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. It's hard to watch a franchise drift so expensively and pointlessly in Earth's orbit.",
      "The gang is all back: Sam Rockwell as Mr. Wolf,Marc Maron as safe-cracker Mr. Snake, Craig Robinson as master-of disguise Mr. Shark, Anthony Ramos as Mr. Piranha and Awkwafina as hacker Ms. Tarantula. We left them in the last movie walking out of prison early after good behavior and trying to turn their back on bad-hood.",
      "It's not that easy since would-be employers these days want to know about gaps in their job experience \u2014 they were robbing banks, after all \u2014 workplace trust issues and salary expectations. No one wants to hire a bunch of ex-cons.",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants to change has to start somewhere,\u201d Mr. Wolf, pushing the George Clooney-like charm offensive, begs one dubious interviewer. \u201cI'm just asking for a chance.\u201d",
      "A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron \u2014 so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Now he spends his days doing Vinyasa yoga, listening to Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cEspresso,\u201d telling people \"namaste\" and sips wheatgrass kombucha with dandelion. He's even more irritating.",
      "Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew \u2014 Danielle Brooks\u2019 lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova\u2019s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne\u2019s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on \u201cPoker Face.\u201d These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever \u2014 or lazy \u2014 joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot.",
      "There's soon a trip to a Mexican wrestling festival and then a wedding needs crashing in order to gain control over a rocket owned by an Elon Musk-like billionaire \u2014 voice acted by Colin Jost \u2014 who runs the MoonX company. Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a \u201c24-carat catastrophe.\u201d",
      "The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. The franchise's love of vroooming and fishtailing Looney Tunes-like car chases stays intact, as does the wavy green air farts that emanate from Piranha.",

      "Based on Aaron Blabey\u2019s popular graphic book series, the first movie in 2022 drove hard into the nature of good and evil \u2014 like asking if DNA determines behavior \u2014 as our heroes whipsawed between heroic and villainous, to the glee of all the kiddies in the theater. \u201cWe may be bad, but we\u2019re so good at it,\u201d was the slogan. It was all nicely set against a zombie guinea pig uprising.",
      "This time the writers have just given up on what side of the ethical divide their anti-heroes are on. \u201cAre we bad again?\u201d ask the confused piranha. Replies Mr. Wolf: \u201cI get it. We're all over the place.\u201d Left unexplored is the concept of doing wrong for a greater good, and can being bad be excused if it stops a worse badness? \u201cWhat if the bad life was your best life?\u201d asks one of the newcomers. (Another thing to chew on: If \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d is a worse sequel, does that make \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d good?)",
      "When we say the gang is all here, they're all here without any editing: Zazie Beetz returns as Gov. Diane Foxington, Alex Borstein comes back as the top cop and even the kitten from the first film meows in the second. So is Richard Ayoade as Professor Marmalade, the evil guinea pig who is now surprisingly swole and tatted up in prison. He threatens again to steal the show and may if there's a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d (There's going to be a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d)",
      "The joy of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d was that it was a respectful send-up of the movies of Quentin Tarantino and caper flicks like \u201cOcean\u2019s 11.\u201d This time, the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d series gets mocked, as does \u201cSilence of the Lambs,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and maybe \u201cMoonraker,\u201d which is now 46 years old. But the subversion is painfully flat now: The first film in the franchise would have laughed at one climactic line in the second: \u201cWe've got one shot to save the world. Let's make it count!\u201d",
      "The three new villains may be a touch too much for younger viewers \u2014 the violence seems darker and more volcanic this time \u2014 but there's a very loud soundtrack that includes Busta Rhymes, Sofi Tukker and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man.",
      "So what does it all mean? It means the folks behind \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d reunited for a shot to push the franchise into exciting areas, but \u2014 c'mon, everyone \u2014 they didn't make it count.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG for \u201caction/mild violence, rude humor, and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "The album's mix of emotions \u2014 heartache followed by the rush of a new crush, the impostor syndrome that accompanies the thrill of success \u2014 is something the AP Breakthrough Entertainer alum has been exploring since her 2022 EP, \u201cEverything to Everyone.\u201d She wants listeners to feel the conflict, too \u2014 and know that they aren't alone in experiencing it.",
      "In June, Rapp served as a grand marshal of the World Pride parade in Washington, D.C., alongside Laverne Cox and Deacon Maccubbin. \u201cIt can be difficult to feel resilient and empowered as a queer person,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cBecause World Pride was in D.C., I was like, well, I can\u2019t not be there.\u201d She recalled a conversation with Cox, who dispelled some of Rapp's fears of coming off as self-important in the role by emphasizing the power of showing up, and showing face. \u201cRight now, when everything is so under attack, which it pretty much always is, it feels like that\u2019s the time to be really loud.\u201d",
      "Rapp will launch the North American leg of her \u201cBite Me\u201d tour at the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheater in September before making stops at New York's Madison Square Garden and as a headliner at the Toronto stop of the All Things Go Festival. She'll tour Europe in March.",

      "Giving them a glimpse into hers, she hopes, is empowering \u2014 and fun: \u201cIt\u2019s just, it feels like a big party that like everybody wants in on.\u201d",

      "For two-plus decades, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival has been a cultural reunion, a summer sanctuary and a safe haven where some of the industry's most influential voices converge in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton.",
      "Over the years, the festival has drawn the who\u2019s who of Black Hollywood \u2014 including Ava DuVernay, Kerry Washington, Tyler Perry and Regina King. The Obamas made a surprise appearance in 2022.",

      "Ross said traveling solo is a way of life. She said sharing her project at MVAAFF felt right, noting that the Vineyard-set episode of Akil's \u201cForever\u201d captures the spirit and beauty of the picturesque island.",
      "\u201cIt felt like the perfect location to kind of share,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timing was perfect from when the show came out.\u201d",
      "Set on the campus of the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Performing Arts Center and the Vineyard Lounge, the festival has grown from a grassroots gathering into a premier destination where Black creatives can find inspiration, connection and support.",

It allows for the completion of the story, so that we can move on to many, many, many more stories that need to be told.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have somewhat of a convergence for folks of like mind in the arts and entertainment to gather, coalesce, share ideas, rekindle friendships and fellowship,\u201d said Floyd, who along with Stephanie said they did not expect their festival to become such a main attraction.",

      "In addition to the panels and screenings, Stephanie Rance said this year's festival centers on the theme of joy, focusing more on celebration than struggle. She\u2019s especially excited for attendees to experience a range of conversations, from little-known moments in Black history to a panel on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Oak Bluffs collection with Morehouse and Spelman.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",
      "In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d",

      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",
      "Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.",

      "\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d",
      "Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.",
      "Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.",
      "The demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races.",
      "Some marketers say they've observed another shift since President Donald Trump returned to office and moved to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies.",
      "Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.",
      "\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.",
      "American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.",
      "The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.",
      "Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.",
      "\u201cThey were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,\" Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. \"But this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.\"",
      "Melissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the \u201csake of the brand.\u201d",
      "Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive.",
      "\u201cIf you try to follow all the rules, you\u2019ll make lots of people happy, but you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cThe rocket won\u2019t take off. \u201d",

      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has asked a judge to dismiss his guilty verdicts on prostitution-related charges or grant him a new trial",
      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has asked a judge to throw out his guilty verdicts on prostitution-related counts or grant him a new trial, saying such convictions are without precedent.",
      "\u201cThis conviction stands alone, but it shouldn't stand at all,\" the Wednesday filing said.",
      "Combs' lawyers argue that his two felony convictions were a unique misapplication of the federal Mann Act, which bars interstate commerce related to prostitution,",
      "\u201cTo our knowledge, Mr. Combs is the only person ever convicted of violating the statute for conduct anything like this,\u201d a Wednesday filing from Combs legal team said.",
      "Combs, 55, was convicted in a New York federal court of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for flying people around the country, including his girlfriends and male sex workers, for sexual encounters, while he was acquitted of more serious charges. He could get up to a decade in prison at his sentencing set for Oct. 3.",
      "His lawyers argued that none of the elements normally used for Mann Act convictions, including profiting from sex work or coercion, were present here.",
      "\u201cIt is undisputed that he had no commercial motive and that all involved were adults,\" The filing said. \u201cThe men chose to travel and engage in the activity voluntarily. The verdict confirms the women were not vulnerable or exploited or trafficked or sexually assaulted.\u201d",
      "The lawyers said that Combs, \u201cat most, paid to engage in voyeurism as part of a \u2018swingers\u2019 lifestyle\u201d and argued that \"does not constitute \u2018prostitution\u2019 under a properly limited definition of the statutory term.\u201d",
      "Combs was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, charges could have put one of hip-hop\u2019s celebrated figures in prison for life.",

      "Prosecutors insisted during the eight-week trial that Combs had coerced, threatened and sometimes viciously forced two ex-girlfriends to have sex with male sex workers to satisfy his sexual urges. They cited multiple acts of violence he carried out against them as proof that they had no say.",

      "Tens of thousands of Deadheads are pouring into San Francisco for three days of Dead & Company concerts in honor of the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Fans of the Grateful Dead are pouring into San Francisco for three days of concerts and festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the scruffy jam band that came to embody a city where people wore flowers in their hair and made love, not war.",
      "Dead & Company, featuring original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field starting Friday with an estimated 60,000 attendees each day. The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",
      "Certainly, times have changed.",
      "A general admissions ticket for all three days is $635 \u2014 a shock for many longtime fans who remember when a joint cost more than a Dead concert ticket.",
      "But Deadhead David Aberdeen is thrilled anyway.",
      "\u201cThis is the spiritual home of the Grateful Dead,\u201d said Aberdeen, who works at Amoeba Music in the bohemian, flower-powered Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. \u201cIt seems very right to me that they celebrate it in this way.\u201d",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead is synonymous with San Francisco and its counterculture. Members lived in a dirt-cheap Victorian in the Haight and later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love.",
      "That summer eventually soured into bad acid trips and police raids, and prompted the band's move to Marin County on the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge. But new Deadheads kept cropping up \u2014 even after iconic guitarist and singer Jerry Garcia \u2019s 1995 death \u2014 aided by cover bands and offshoots like Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cThere are 18-year-olds who were obviously not even a twinkle in somebody\u2019s eyes when Jerry died, and these 18-year-olds get the values of Deadheads,\u201d said former Grateful Dead publicist and author Dennis McNally.",
      "Deadheads can reel off why and how, and the moment they fell in love with the music. Fans love that no two shows are the same; the band plays different songs each time. They also embrace the community that comes with a Dead show.",
      "Sunshine Powers didn\u2019t have friends until age 13, when she stepped off a city bus and into the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.",
      "\u201cI, all of a sudden, felt like I fit in. Or like I didn\u2019t have to fit in,\u201d says Powers, now 45 and the owner of tie-dye emporium Love on Haight. \u201cI don\u2019t know which one it was, but I know it was like, OK.\"",
      "Similarly, her friend Taylor Swope, 47, survived a tough freshman year at a new school with the help of a Grateful Dead mixtape. The owner of the Little Hippie gift shop is driving from Brooklyn, New York, to sell merchandise, reconnect with friends and see the shows.",
      "\u201cThe sense of, \u2018I found my people, I didn\u2019t fit in anywhere else and then I found this, and I felt at home.\u2019 So that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d she said of the allure.",
      "Sometimes, becoming a Deadhead is a process.",
      "Thor Cromer, 60, had attended several Dead shows, but was ambivalent about the hippies. That changed on March 15, 1990, in Landover, Maryland.",

      "Aberdeen, 62, saw his first Dead show in 1984. As the only person in his college group with a driver's license, he was tapped to drive a crowded VW Bug from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, to Syracuse, New York.",
      "\u201cI thought it was pretty weird,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I liked it.\u201d",
      "He fell in love the following summer, when the Dead played a venue near his college.",
      "Aberdeen remembers rain pouring down in the middle of the show and a giant rainbow appearing over the band when they returned for their second act. They played \u201cComes a Time,\u201d a rarely played Garcia ballad.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of excitement, and there will be a lot of people here,\u201d Aberdeen said. \u201cWho knows when we\u2019ll have an opportunity to get together like this again?\u201d",
      "Fans were able to see Dead & Company in Las Vegas earlier this year, but no new dates have been announced. Guitarist Bob Weir is 77, and drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann are 81 and 79, respectively. Besides Garcia, founding members Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan on keyboards died in 1973 and bassist Phil Lesh died last year at age 84.",

      "The weekend features parties, shows and celebrations throughout the city. Grahame Lesh & Friends will perform three nights starting Thursday. Lesh is the son of Phil Lesh.",
      "On Friday, which would have been Garcia\u2019s 83rd birthday, officials will rename a street after the San Francisco native. On Saturday, visitors can celebrate the city\u2019s annual Jerry Day at the Jerry Garcia Amphitheater located in a park near Garcia\u2019s childhood home.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "He won a following in the 1950s and \u201960s lampooning marriage, politics, racism.",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Tom Lehrer, the popular song satirist who lampooned marriage, politics, racism and the Cold War, then largely abandoned his music career to return to teaching math at Harvard and other universities, has died. He was 97.",
      "Longtime friend David Herder said Lehrer died Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He did not specify a cause of death.",
      "Lehrer had remained on the math faculty of the University of California at Santa Cruz well into his late 70s. In 2020, he even turned away from his own copyright, granting the public permission to use his lyrics in any format without any fee in return.",
      "A Harvard prodigy (he had earned a math degree from the institution at age 18), Lehrer soon turned his very sharp mind to old traditions and current events. His songs included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler\" (set to a tune reminiscent of \"The Old Lamplighter\"), \"Be Prepared\" (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and \"The Vatican Rag,\" in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church. (Sample lyrics: \u201cGet down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.\u201d)",
      "Accompanying himself on piano, he performed the songs in a colorful style reminiscent of such musical heroes as Gilbert and Sullivan and Stephen Sondheim, the latter a lifelong friend. Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics and he was cited by Randy Newman and \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic among others as an influence.",
      "He mocked the forms of music he didn't like (modern folk songs, rock 'n' roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.",
      "But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.",
      "\"Tom Lehrer is the most brilliant song satirist ever recorded,\" musicologist Barry Hansen once said. Hansen co-produced the 2000 boxed set of Lehrer's songs, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer,\" and had featured Lehrer's music for decades on his syndicated \"Dr. Demento\" radio show.",
      "Lehrer's body of work was actually quite small, amounting to about three dozen songs.",
      "\"When I got a funny idea for a song, I wrote it. And if I didn't, I didn't,\" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 2000 during a rare interview. \"I wasn't like a real writer who would sit down and put a piece of paper in the typewriter. And when I quit writing, I just quit. ... It wasn't like I had writer's block.\"",
      "He'd gotten into performing accidentally when he began to compose songs in the early 1950s to amuse his friends. Soon he was performing them at coffeehouses around Cambridge, while he remained at Harvard to teach and obtain a master's degree in math.",
      "He cut his first record in 1953, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" which included \"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\" lampooning the attitudes of the Old South, and the \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard,\" suggesting how a prissy Harvard blueblood might sing a football fight song.",
      "After a two-year stint in the Army, Lehrer began to perform concerts of his material in venues around the world. In 1959, he released another LP called \"More of Tom Lehrer\" and a live recording called \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical) in 1960.",
      "But around the same time, he largely quit touring and returned to teaching math, though he did some writing and performing on the side.",
      "Lehrer said he was never comfortable appearing in public.",
      "\"I enjoyed it up to a point,\" he told The AP in 2000. \"But to me, going out and performing the concert every night when it was all available on record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel every night.\"",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to relax rules aimed at reducing auto tailpipe emissions",
      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",
      "Carlson said backing away from future fines also \u201cposes a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.\u201d",
      "It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years. But changes could come for model year 2027 and beyond, they said.",
      "EVs aren't as profitable as gas-engine cars, so automakers may make fewer of them if they no longer have to offset emissions from their gasoline models. Already, some automakers have pulled back on their ambitions to go all-electric with a slower pace of EV sales growth.",
      "\u201cAutomakers also know every presidential administration eventually comes to an end, so they won\u2019t abandon their EV development efforts,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com. \"But they will reduce their near-term efforts in this area.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the share of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to federal data posted Thursday.",
      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",

      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",

      "\u201cBecause the last thing we need them to do is to choose not to participate in our school lunch program,\u201d she said, adding that schools provide many students their healthiest meals of the day.",
      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",

      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "A bipartisan program in Michigan aims to address the high costs of parenting by giving mothers thousands of dollars in cash with no strings attached",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",
      "\u201cFor so long moms have been vilified and not supported,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\u201cSo this time around, I didn\u2019t have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\u201d she said.",

      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations but Hanna\u2019s long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\u201cI see philanthropy as the doula of this program, they are helping birth it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are helping us prove that this is possible.\u201d",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \u201cno brainer\u201d way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\u201d",

      "The bill will also create a new children\u2019s saving program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That\u2019s not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cNo wonder people aren\u2019t having children and our birth rates are going down.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \u201cbaby bonuses,\u201d a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s part of a new narrative or the rekindling of an old narrative where we start to celebrate children and families,\u201d said Damoose.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump.",

      "Two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Prasad was ousted following several recent controversies. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.",
      "Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA\u2019s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "His contrarian approach appeared to match FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who repeatedly praised Prasad\u2019s work and intellect.",
      "But in recent weeks Prasad became a target of conservative activists, including Laura Loomer, who flagged Prasad\u2019s past statements criticizing Trump and praising liberal independent Senator Bernie Sanders.",

      "Prasad has long been skeptical of the therapy and other muscular dystrophy drugs sold by the drugmaker, Sarepta Therapeutics. As an academic, Prasad gained prominence by attacking the FDA for being too lenient in its standards for approving cancer drugs and other new therapies.",
      "That approach is at odds with Trump\u2019s Republican supporters, who generally favor speedier approvals and unfettered access to experimental treatments. During Trump\u2019s first term he signed the \u201c Right to Try \u201d law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.",

      "That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting, in June.

      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

      "The authors of the study said that is why it is crucial to monitor ex-POWs and give them specialized medical and psychological care as they age.",
      "That logic rings true to Denys Zalizko, a 21-year-old former POW who has been back in Ukraine for less than three months but is already sure his recovery will take a long time.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fool yourself. Even if you really want to, you will never forget. It will always haunt you,\u201d he said.",
      "Zalizko said he survived torture, suicide attempts and relentless beatings during roughly 15 months in Russian captivity.",

      "Zalizko's physical appearance is now almost completely different. His skin looks healthy, his muscles are taut and he has lots of energy. But still there is sadness in his eyes.",
      "Two things keep him moving forward and help clear his mind: music and exercise.",
      "\u201cPauses and stillness bring anxiety,\u201d says Zalizko.",
      "Like Tarnavskyi, he is receiving mandatory counseling at the Lisova Polyana mental health center. And like many former POWs, he still battles hypervigilance \u2014 listening for threats, scanning his surroundings. At night, sleep comes in fragments, and that was true even before a recent uptick in nightly drone attacks by the Russian army.",
      "For the families of POWs, the reintegration process is also a struggle.",

      "\u201cI love music. Music unites,\u201d he said, touching the tattoo of a treble clef behind his ear \u2014 inked after his return. Even in captivity, he sang quietly to himself, composing songs in his mind about love, home and war. Now he dreams of turning that passion into a career as an artist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve become stronger now,\u201d Zalizko said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, not afraid of losing an arm or a leg, not afraid of dying instantly. I fear nothing anymore.\u201d",

      "The Pride march in Budapest on June 28 was the largest event of its kind in the country's history, according to organizers, despite Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's government earlier passing an anti-LGBTQ+ law that banned such events.",
      "Budapest Mayor Gergely Kar\u00e1csony arrived at Hungary's National Bureau of Investigation Friday morning where a crowd of around 200 of his supporters had gathered. Before entering the investigators' headquarters under police escort, he told supporters that freedom for Hungarian society was at stake.",
      "\u201cA month ago at Budapest Pride, very, very many of us told the whole world that neither freedom nor love can be banned in Budapest,\u201d Kar\u00e1csony said. \u201cAnd if it cannot be banned, then it cannot be punished.\u201d",

The arrangement aligns New Zealand with FBI missions in other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations, which also include the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.",

      "Yoon, removed from office in April over his ill-fated imposition of martial law, was sent back to prison last month as he stands a high-stakes trial over rebellion and other charges. Yoon, a conservative, faces investigations into other criminal allegations that are not related to his Dec. 3 martial law decree but target him, his wife and others.",

The food is familiar and crowd-pleasing. But perhaps the biggest driver of the recent uptick is ample opportunity for a range of outings, which together with the wedding event are alluring for those on a quest for unique, memorable moments \u2014 part of a consumer trend termed \u201cthe experience economy.\u201d",

      "Leo will surely like what he sees: For the past week, bands of young Catholics from around the world have invaded the area around St. Peter\u2019s Square for their special Jubilee celebration, in this Holy Year in which 32 million people are expected to descend on Rome to participate in a centuries-old pilgrimage to the seat of Catholicism.",
      "The young people have been traipsing through cobblestoned streets in color-coordinated t-shirts, praying the Rosary and singing hymns with guitars, bongo drums and tambourines shimmying alongside. Using their flags as tarps to shield them from the sun, they have taken over entire piazzas for Christian rock concerts and inspirational talks, and stood for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to 1,000 priests offering the sacrament in a dozen different languages.",
      "On Saturday, they began arriving at the Tor Vergata field on the eastern flank of Rome for the culmination of their Jubilee celebration \u2014 the encounter with Leo. After walking five kilometers (three miles) from the nearest subway station, they passed through security checks, picked up their boxed meals and set up camp, backpacks and sleeping bags at the ready and umbrellas planted to give them shade.",
      "Leo, who was elected in May as the first American pope, was flying in by helicopter Saturday evening to preside over the vigil and a question-and-answer session. He was then returning to the Vatican for the night and coming back for a popemobile romp and Mass on Sunday morning.",
      "It all has the vibe of a World Youth Day, the Catholic Woodstock festival that St. John Paul II inaugurated and made famous in 2000 in Rome at the very same Tor Vergata field. Then, before an estimated 2 million people, John Paul told the young pilgrims they were the \u201csentinels of the morning\u201d at the dawn of the third millennium.",
      "Officials had initially expected 500,000 youngsters this weekend, but Leo hinted the number might reach 1 million.",

      "She said, for example, it had taken two hours to get dinner Friday night, as the KFC was overwhelmed by orders. The Salesian school that offered her group housing is an hour away by bus. But Jobbour, like many here this week, didn\u2019t mind the discomfort: It\u2019s all part of the experience.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect it to be better than that. I expected it this way,\u201d she said, as members of her group gathered on church steps near the Vatican to sing and pray before heading out to Tor Vergata.",
      "There was already one tragedy before the vigil began: The Vatican confirmed that an Egyptian 18-year-old, identified as Pascale Rafic, had died while on the pilgrimage. Leo met Saturday with the group she was traveling with and extended his condolences to her family.",

      "Indonesia\u2019s Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the slopes of the mountain. Drone observations showed deep movement of magma, setting off tremors that registered on seismic monitors.",
      "Volcanic material, including hot thumb-sized gravel, was thrown up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater, covering nearby villages and towns with thick volcanic residue, the agency said.

      "Saturday's eruption was one of Indonesia\u2019s largest since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country\u2019s most volatile volcano, erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That eruption killed more than 350 people and forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate.",

      "Two pubs in London's East End are vying for the title of the city's oldest riverside pub",
      "LONDON -- On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London\u2019s East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads \u201cOldest riverside pub in London.\u201d Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim.",
      "The unofficial title of the oldest riverside pub in the city has long been disputed, with both the Mayflower and the Prospect of Whitby laying claim to the title.",
      "The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city\u2019s crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes \u2014 from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding \u2014 with a side of history.",
      "The Mayflower is named after the Pilgrim Mayflower ship, which set sail from the site in 1620 to begin its journey to America. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship\u2019s original timbers incorporated into its structure.",
      "Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its \u201cDescendants Book.\u201d",
      "Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital\u2019s modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London\u2019s East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses.",
      "In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind.",
      "\u201cThere really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,\" said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening.",
      "The Prospect boasts a pewter bar \u2013 the longest of its kind in Britain \u2014 where the infamous \u201cHanging Judge Jeffreys\u201d is said to have watched the many hangings that took place at the nearby \u201cExecution Dock.\u201d Early on, the pub was known as the Devil\u2019s Tavern due to its association with thieves and smugglers. A hanging noose outside serves as a reminder of the pub\u2019s grisly history.",
      "It \u201cfeels like such a pocket of history in London,\u201d Godwin said. \u201cSo much of London\u2019s East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it\u2019s barely changed.\u201d",
      "British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. But the last five years have been challenging for the industry as pubs contended with the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs.",
      "This year an estimated 378 venues are set to shutter across England, Wales, and Scotland, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.",
      "\u201cWhen a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul and hurts the local economy,\u201d said Emma McClarkin, head of the BBPA.",

      "History is a big draw for pubgoers, with a trip to a traditional British pub coming in high on tourists\u2019 London bucket lists, raising the stakes of the Prospect and the Mayflower\u2019s competition.",
      "The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 \u2014 the same year as the Great Fire of London. The pub was outside of the city limits at that time and was not affected by the conflagration that gutted the medieval city.",
      "Justin Billington, assistant manager at the Prospect, said some people date the pub to its full reconstruction in 1774 after the 1666 fire. But he doesn't see it that way, noting that it operated continuously. The day after the fire, the workers rolled out a barrel of beer that had survived the flames and locals showed up with their tankards, drinking vessels, and enjoyed a drink on the spot.",
      "There were several reconstructions in the pub's subsequent history, but none withstood the salt water and shifting foundations of the Thames, Billington explained. Not, that is, until 1774 when the retired captain of a merchant ship called \u201cThe Prospect\u201d rebuilt it using the ship.",
      "\u201cThis rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,\" he said.",
      "If the pub was actually established in 1774, that would make the Mayflower \u2014 established in the 16th century \u2014 older.",
      "But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a \u201cloving rivalry.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,\u201d he said.",
      "But the question remains: How can either pub definitively claim the title?",
      "Unlike the title of the \u201cOldest pub in England,\u201d held by the Porch House in southern England, which is said to date to the 10th century, there is no official certification for the oldest pub in London.",
      "Guinness World Records said it has not formally awarded the title because of the complexities created by numerous name changes, relocations and reconstructions.",
      "\u201cThere are lots of very old pubs that might make a claim to being oldest, but it could be contested because it could be argued they weren\u2019t always in \u2018London,\u2019\u201d English historian and author Jacob Field said. \u201cMany pubs have changed name over time, making it hard to claim they are the oldest.\"",

      "A Miami jury decided that Elon Musk\u2019s car company Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology and must pay the victims more than $200 million in damages",
      "MIAMI -- A Miami jury decided that Elon Musk\u2019s car company Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology and must pay the victims more than $200 million in punitive damages.",
      "The federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility because its technology failed and that not all the blame can be put on a reckless driver, even one who admitted he was distracted by his cell phone before hitting a young couple out gazing at the stars. The decision comes as Musk seeks to convince Americans his cars are safe enough to drive on their own as he plans to roll out a driverless taxi service in several cities in the coming months.",
      "The decision ends a four-year long case remarkable not just in its outcome but that it even made it to trial. Many similar cases against Tesla have been dismissed and, when that didn't happen, settled by the company to avoid the spotlight of a trial.",
      "\u201cThis will open the floodgates,\u201d said Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case. \u201cIt will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\u201d",
      "The case also included startling charges by lawyers for the family of the deceased, 22-year-old, Naibel Benavides Leon, and for her injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. They claimed Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident.",
      "Tesla has previously faced criticism that it is slow to cough up crucial data by relatives of other victims in Tesla crashes, accusations that the car company has denied. In this case, the plaintiffs showed Tesla had the evidence all along, despite its repeated denials, by hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up. Tesla said it made a mistake after being shown the evidence and honestly hadn\u2019t thought it was there.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is wrong,\" Tesla said in a statement, \u201cand only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\u201d They said the plaintiffs concocted a story \u201dblaming the car when the driver \u2013 from day one \u2013 admitted and accepted responsibility.\u201d",
      "In addition to the punitive award, the jury said Tesla must also pay $49 million in compensatory damages, bringing the total borne by the company to $249 million.",
      "\u201cIt's a big number that will send shockwaves to others in the industry,\u201d said financial analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt's not a good day for Tesla.\u201d",
      "Tesla said it will appeal.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of a hit to Tesla\u2019s reputation for safety the verdict in the Miami case will make. Tesla has vastly improved its technology since the crash on a dark, rural road in Key Largo, Florida, in 2019.",
      "But the issue of trust generally in the company came up several times in the case, including in closing arguments Thursday. The plaintiffs\u2019 lead lawyer, Brett Schreiber, said Tesla\u2019s decision to even use the term Autopilot showed it was willing to mislead people and take big risks with their lives because the system only helps drivers with lane changes, slowing a car and other tasks, falling far short of driving the car itself.",
      "Schreiber said other automakers use terms like \u201cdriver assist\u201d and \u201ccopilot\u201d to make sure drivers don\u2019t rely too much on the technology.",

      "Schreiber acknowledged that the driver, George McGee, was negligent when he blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles an hour before slamming into a Chevrolet Tahoe that the couple had parked to get a look at the stars.",
      "The Tahoe spun around so hard it was able to launch Benavides 75 feet through the air into nearby woods where her body was later found. It also left Angulo, who walked into the courtroom Friday with a limp and cushion to sit on, with broken bones and a traumatic brain injury.",
      "But Schreiber said Tesla was at fault nonetheless. He said Tesla allowed drivers to act recklessly by not disengaging the Autopilot as soon as they begin to show signs of distraction and by allowing them to use the system on smaller roads that it was not designed for, like the one McGee was driving on.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said McGee at one point in his testimony. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "The lead defense lawyer in the Miami case, Joel Smith, countered that Tesla warns drivers that they must keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel yet McGee chose not to do that while he looked for a dropped cell phone, adding to the danger by speeding. Noting that McGee had gone through the same intersection 30 or 40 times previously and hadn\u2019t crashed during any of those trips, Smith said that this isolates the cause to one thing alone: \u201cThe cause is that he dropped his cell phone.\u201d",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft\u2019s core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",

Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI think one of the reasons why that cash hasn\u2019t been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there\u2019s a logical case to be made they\u2019ll accept it.\u201d",

      "Two pubs in London's East End are vying for the title of the city's oldest riverside pub",
      "LONDON -- On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London\u2019s East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads \u201cOldest riverside pub in London.\u201d Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim.",
      "The unofficial title of the oldest riverside pub in the city has long been disputed, with both the Mayflower and the Prospect of Whitby laying claim to the title.",
      "The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city\u2019s crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes \u2014 from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding \u2014 with a side of history.",
      "The Mayflower is named after the Pilgrim Mayflower ship, which set sail from the site in 1620 to begin its journey to America. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship\u2019s original timbers incorporated into its structure.",
      "Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its \u201cDescendants Book.\u201d",
      "Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital\u2019s modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London\u2019s East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses.",
      "In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind.",
      "\u201cThere really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,\" said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening.",
      "The Prospect boasts a pewter bar \u2013 the longest of its kind in Britain \u2014 where the infamous \u201cHanging Judge Jeffreys\u201d is said to have watched the many hangings that took place at the nearby \u201cExecution Dock.\u201d Early on, the pub was known as the Devil\u2019s Tavern due to its association with thieves and smugglers. A hanging noose outside serves as a reminder of the pub\u2019s grisly history.",
      "It \u201cfeels like such a pocket of history in London,\u201d Godwin said. \u201cSo much of London\u2019s East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it\u2019s barely changed.\u201d",
      "British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. But the last five years have been challenging for the industry as pubs contended with the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs.",

      "The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 \u2014 the same year as the Great Fire of London. The pub was outside of the city limits at that time and was not affected by the conflagration that gutted the medieval city.",
      "Justin Billington, assistant manager at the Prospect, said some people date the pub to its full reconstruction in 1774 after the 1666 fire. But he doesn't see it that way, noting that it operated continuously. The day after the fire, the workers rolled out a barrel of beer that had survived the flames and locals showed up with their tankards, drinking vessels, and enjoyed a drink on the spot.",
      "There were several reconstructions in the pub's subsequent history, but none withstood the salt water and shifting foundations of the Thames, Billington explained. Not, that is, until 1774 when the retired captain of a merchant ship called \u201cThe Prospect\u201d rebuilt it using the ship.",
      "\u201cThis rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,\" he said.",
      "If the pub was actually established in 1774, that would make the Mayflower \u2014 established in the 16th century \u2014 older.",
      "But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a \u201cloving rivalry.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,\u201d he said.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have drawn expressions of relief from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April",
      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries drew expressions of relief Friday from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others expressed disappointment or frustration over running out of time after hitting Trump's Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America\u2019s trading partners.",
      "The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7, but uncertainty over what Trump might do next remains. The way ahead for China, which runs the largest trade surplus with the U.S., is unclear after talks earlier this week in Stockholm produced no deal. Trump has yet to say if he'll extend an Aug. 12 pause on painfully high import duties on Chinese products.",
      "The reaction from financial markets was muted. Benchmarks fell in Asia, with South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping nearly 4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at more than 150 yen per dollar.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government was disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.",
      "Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.",
      "\u201cCanada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\u201d Carney said in a statement.",
      "Many of Canada's exports to the U.S. are covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and face no tariff. But steel, lumber, aluminum and autos have been subject to still higher tariffs.",
      "Switzerland was reeling after Trump ordered a 39% tariff rate for the land of luxury watches, pharmaceuticals and financial services. That was up from his original proposal of a 31% duty.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Council notes with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland\u2019s very constructive stance from the outset, the U.S. intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland,\u201d the government said in a post on X. It said it would continue to seek a negotiated solution.",
      "New Zealand officials said Friday they would keep lobbying Trump to cut the 15% tariff he announced for their country\u2019s exports to the U.S., up from the original 10% baseline set in April.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a good thing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Trade Minister Todd McClay told Radio New Zealand. The exporter of meat, dairy, wine and farm machinery ran a $1.1 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, according to U.S. Trade Representative data.",
      "McClay said New Zealand exporters had reported they could absorb a 10% tariff or pass it on to U.S. consumers through increased costs. A further increase would \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said.",
      "Neither New Zealand nor its neighbor Australia have struck tariff deals with the Trump administration. Australian steel and aluminum exports have faced a steep 50% tariff since June.",
      "Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the 10% overall tariff on Australia\u2019s exports to the United States was a vindication of his government\u2019s \u201ccool and calm negotiations.\u201d But he said even that level was not justified. The U.S. exports twice as much to Australia as it imports from its bilateral free trade partner, and Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. exports.",
      "Objecting to a 15% tariff rate, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re told the newspaper VG the Scandinavian country should have \u201czero tariffs.\" He said talks were continuing.",
      "Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi was cautious in welcoming Trump's executive order setting Japan\u2019s tariff at 15% after the two sides worked out an agreement, much to Tokyo's relief.",

      "The government told the organizations on Thursday via email that their experts are being disinvited from the workgroups that have been the backbone of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "The organizations include the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned and distressed,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccine expert who for decades has been involved with ACIP and its workgroups.",
      "He said the move will likely propel a confusing fragmentation of vaccine guidance, as patients may hear the government say one thing and hear their doctors say another.",

      "A federal health official on Friday confirmed the action, which was first reported by Bloomberg.",
      "The decision was the latest development in what has become a saga involving the ACIP. The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used.",
      "CDC directors have traditionally almost always approved those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and greenlight insurance coverage for shots.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, and in June abruptly fired the entire ACIP after accusing them of being too closely aligned with manufacturers. He handpicked replacements that include several vaccine skeptics.",
      "The workgroups typically include committee members and experts from medical and scientific organizations. At workgroup meetings, members evaluate data from vaccine manufacturers and the CDC, and formulate vaccination recommendation proposals to be presented to the full committee.",
      "The structure was created for several reasons, Schaffner said. The professional groups provide input about what might and might not be possible for doctors to implement. And it helped build respect and trust in ACIP recommendations, having the buy-in of respected medical organizations, he said.",

      "American businesses and consumers are finding the contours of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign trade agenda taking shape",
      "It\u2019s been almost 100 years since the U.S. had tariffs at the level they could reach next Friday.",
      "Once President Donald Trump's planned tariffs take effect, Americans will see an average tax of 18.3% for imported products, the highest rate since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center.",
      "Late Thursday, Trump ordered new tariff rates for 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. Among them: a 40% tariff on imports from Laos, a 39% tariff on goods from Switzerland and a 30% tariff on South African products.",
      "Other trade partners, such as Cambodia and Bangladesh, had the tax rates on their exports to the U.S. reduced from levels the president had threatened to impose. Trump postponed the start date for all of the changes from Friday until Aug. 7.",
      "Tariffs are a tax, and U.S. consumers are likely to foot at least part of the bill. The Budget Lab estimated that prices will increase 1.8% in the short term as a result of the trade war the U.S. waged this year. That\u2019s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, the group said.",
      "Companies are dealing with tariffs in various ways. Many automakers appear to be swallowing tariff costs for now. But the world\u2019s largest eyewear maker, EssilorLuxottica, said it raised U.S. prices due to tariffs. The maker of Ray-Bans grinds lenses and sunglasses in Mexico, Thailand and China and exports premium frames from Italy.",
      "\u201cRetailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new tariffs will impact merchandise in the coming weeks,\u201d David French, chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, the nation\u2019s largest retail trade group, said Friday. \u201cWe have heard directly from small retailers who are concerned about their ability to stay in business in the face of these unsustainable tariff rates.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the tariffs and what their impact will be on U.S. consumers:",
      "Trump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from nearly every country in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.",
      "The president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that the higher tariffs would go into effect Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals.",
      "In announcing the new rates for dozens of countries on Thursday, Trump delayed their implementation until Aug. 7.",
      "In the meantime, he announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada would take effect Friday. But Trump delayed action on Mexico and China while negotiations continue.",
      "Other duties not specific to countries also remained in place Friday, like a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June.",
      "The Trump administration reached deals with the European Union, Japan and South Korea that put 15% tariffs in place. A deal with the Philippines puts 19% tariffs in place while a deal with Vietnam imposes a 20% levy. This week, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods from India and ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal court that specializes in trade disputes, ruled in May that Trump exceeded his authority when he invoked an emergency powers law to implement tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, an 11-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals considered the case, and judges expressed skepticism that Trump could impose tariffs without congressional approval. The case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May and higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%. Furniture, computers and other items that often come from abroad were among the categories with higher average prices.",

      "But Zhang said a 15% tariff doesn't mean prices will immediately rise by 15%. Companies were aware of the tariff deadlines, and tried to stockpile goods and take other measures to mitigate the impacts, he said.",
      "Zhang noted that Trump's trade deals often contain specific provisions designed to boost U.S. exports. The agreement with the European Union, for example, calls for European companies to purchase $750 billion worth of natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel from the U.S. over three years.",
      "Some U.S. farmers could also see a potential upside, Zhang said. As part of its trade deal, Vietnam agreed to purchase $2 billion in U.S. agricultural products over three years, including corn, wheat and soybeans, according to the International Trade Council.",
      "But Zhang cautioned that agricultural agreements tend to be short-lived. Over the longer term, the uncertainty over tariffs could cause countries like China to back away from U.S. agricultural markets, he said.",
      "The tariffs will almost certainly result in higher food prices, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. The U.S. simply doesn't make enough of some products, like bananas or coffee, to satisfy demand. Fish, beer and liquor are also likely to get more expensive, the foundation said.",
      "Ben Aneff, managing partner at Tribeca Wine Merchants and president of the U.S. Wine Trade Alliance, said shoppers would see prices rise 20% to 25% at his store and others starting Friday because of tariffs and the declining value of the dollar.",
      "\u201cNobody can afford to eat the tariff. It gets passed on,\" Aneff said.",
      "Aneff said shoppers haven\u2019t felt the impact from higher duties until now because distributors and retailers accelerated shipments from France and other European Union countries earlier in the year. But with the EU's tariff rate set to go up to 15% in a week, Aneff expects European wine prices to jump 30% in September.",
      "Ninety-seven percent of clothing and shoes sold in the U.S. are imported, primarily from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association said. China leads the pack, but companies have been shifting more of their sourcing to Vietnam, Indonesia and India.",
      "Steve Lamar, the trade group's president and CEO, declined to estimate how much apparel and footwear prices may increase due to tariffs. But companies may offer fewer discounts or drop products starting this fall because they're too expensive to produce, he said.",
      "Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, estimates prices for shoes are starting to go up for the back-to-school shopping season. He estimates price increases in the 5% to 10% range.",
      "Some automakers have already raised prices to counteract tariffs. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said Thursday it was waiting for more details of Trump's trade deal with the European Union before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put in place in April on most vehicles in the U.S.",
      "But for the most part, automakers haven't raised prices as they waited for details. Kelley Blue Book, which monitors car pricing, said the average U.S. new car cost $48,907 in June, which was up just $108 from May.",
      "But that could change. General Motors said last week that the impact of the tariffs could get more pronounced in the third quarter of the year. GM has estimated that the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year.",

      "Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has been fired after releasing a jobs report that angered President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the agency that compiles the closely watched monthly jobs report usually toils in obscurity, but on Friday, the current holder of that job was loudly fired by the president of the United States.",
      "Erika McEntarfer, a longtime government employee, bore the brunt of President Donald Trump\u2019s unhappiness with Friday\u2019s jobs report, which showed that hiring had slowed in July and was much less in May and June that previously estimated. He accused her without evidence of manipulating the job numbers and noted she was an appointee of President Joe Biden.",
      "McEntarfer, a longtime government worker who had served as BLS head for a year and a half, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press. But her predecessor overseeing the jobs agency, former co-workers and associates have denounced the firing, warning about its repercussions and saying McEntarfer was nonpolitical in her role.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Erika McEntarfer:",
      "McEntarfer, whose research focuses on job loss, retirement, worker mobility, and wage rigidity, had previously worked at the Census Bureau\u2019s Center for Economic Studies, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Tax Policy and the White House Council of Economic Advisers in a nonpolitical role.",
      "She has a bachelor's degree in Social Science from Bard College and a doctoral degree in economics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.",
      "McEntarfer was nominated in 2023 to serve as BLS head, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions recommended that her nomination go to the full Senate for a vote.",
      "She was confirmed as BLS commissioner in January 2024 on a bipartisan 86-8 Senate vote. Among the Republican senators who voted to confirm her included then-Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who is now Trump's vice president, and then-Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is now Trump's secretary of state.",
      "Before her confirmation hearing, a group called the Friends of the BLS, made up of former commissioners who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, members of statistical associations and credentialed economists, said McEntarfer's background made her a great choice for the job.",
      "\u201cThe many reasons to quickly confirm Dr. McEntarfer as the new BLS Commissioner all boil down to this: the agency, like the entire statistical system, is undergoing an intense, significant period of change and Dr. McEntarfer\u2019s wealth of research and statistical experience have equipped her to be the strong leader that BLS needs to meet these challenges,\u201d Friends of the BLS wrote.",
      "William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner in 2019 by Trump and served until 2023 during President Joe Biden's administration, called McEntarfer's firing \u201cgroundless\u201d and said in an X post that it \u201csets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump may have gotten his way with tariffs on some countries, but his overhaul of American trade policy has not gone unchallenged",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has been getting his way on trade, strong-arming the European Union, Japan and other partners to accept once unthinkably high taxes on their exports to the United States.",
      "But his radical overhaul of American trade policy, in which he's bypassed Congress to slam big tariffs on most of the world's economies, has not gone unchallenged. He's facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he's overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out.",
      "And they won Round One.",
      "In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, ruled that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country in the world. In reaching its decision, the court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "Now it goes on to Round Two.",
      "On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down.",
      "That court earlier allowed the federal government to continue collecting Trump\u2019s tariffs as the case works its way through the judicial system.",
      "The issues are so weighty \u2014 involving the president\u2019s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad \u2014 that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides.",
      "Trump is an unabashed fan of tariffs. He sees the import taxes as an all-purpose economic tool that can bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect American industries, raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts in his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u2019\u2019 pressure countries into bending to his will, even end wars.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes \u2014 including tariffs \u2014 to Congress. But lawmakers have gradually relinquished power over trade policy to the White House. And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "At issue in the pending court case is Trump\u2019s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes.",

      "Bader saw enough to know the Phillies might have finally landed the closer that can put them over the top and win the franchise's first World Series title since 2008.",
      "\u201cPlain and simple, he has close-the-door stuff,\u201d Bader said. \u201cTough situation, runner on, maybe baseball happens, he kind of puts a couple runners on. He's got strikeout stuff to strike out three in a row. I've seen it all year. I've seen it on the other side.\u201d",
      "Bader and Duran both joined the Phillies on Friday for the start of a three-game series against Detroit. Bader, a right-handed hitting outfielder, and Duran were both acquired on consecutive days in separate trades with the Minnesota Twins. They are now thrust into the thick of a pennant race.",
      "Duran's role is settled. He's the closer \u2014 the Phillies tested out his fire entrance on the big screen ahead of his debut. The 27-year-old Duran \u2014 nicknamed Durantulla and he wore spider cleats on Friday \u2014 had 16 saves and a 2.01 ERA in 49 appearances this season, striking out 53 in 49 1/3 innings.",
      "\u201cIt's an honor to be part of this team,\u201d Duran said. \u201cI know here I've got a chance to win the World Series.\u201d",

      "The right-handed hitting Bader will start his Phillies career in a center field platoon with Brandon Marsh. The left-handed hitting Marsh got the start Friday against Tigers righty Jack Flaherty.",
      "Phillies manager Rob Thomson said he planned a double-platoon in the outfield (slugger Nick Castellanos is entrenched in right field). Because the Phillies are scheduled to face alternating right- and left-handed pitchers over the next six games with Detroit and Baltimore, Bader and Marsh will platoon over that stretch. Same with lefty-swinging Max Kepler and Otto Kemp in left field.",
      "How well they hit over that small sample size could decide Thomson's lineup for the pennant stretch as the Phillies chase the New York Mets in the NL East.",
      "Thomson said he hadn't ruled out Bader in left field, \u201cbut I see him sort of as the best center fielder we've got.\u201d",

      "\u201cBYU was an amazing place. It made me into an amazing human being. I feel like it helped me grow in so many ways on and especially off the field,\u201d Retzlaff said, wearing a Star of David on a chain around his neck. \u201cIt helped me connect stronger with my faith than I did before, because I was in a place where it was so faith-oriented that it was just right in front of you.\u201d",
      "Retzlaff went 11-2 as a starter for a 2024 BYU team that finished the season at No. 13 in the final AP Top 25 Poll.",
      "His decision to withdraw came while he reportedly faced a suspension for acknowledging what he described as a consensual sexual relationship while defending himself against the lawsuit. The university's honor code requires students to abstain from premarital sex.",
      "Speaking on Friday for the first time since arriving at Tulane about a week ago, Retzlaff declined to address the factors that led him to leave BYU, where he spent the past two years.",

      "Tulane coach Jon Sumrall said the university's administration vetted Retzlaff before clearing the way for Sumrall to bring him to the Green Wave, where he'll now have to outperform three other transfer QBs \u2014 Kadin Semonza from Ball State, Donovan Leary from Illinois and Brendan Sullivan from Iowa \u2014 to win the starting job.",
      "\u201cI was very transparent with the guys in the (quarterback) room. I was also very up front with Jake,\u201d Sumrall said. \u201cNone of them were promised anything in regards to who\u2019s going to start.\u201d",
      "Retzlaff said he had other offers, but remembered fondly his recruitment by the then-coach of Troy in 2023 \u2014 Sumrall.",

      "\u201cGreg and I have been going back and forth in a very good way, very positive,\" Gaines said.",
      "He called Meehan a good choice and said he's had too little time to turn things around. Gaines also pointed out that the focus is the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. These world championships, less so.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just heartbreaking for all of us. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cAn amazing young man, and so we\u2019re optimistic about his recovery and I think that\u2019s good news for all of us in the NFL and obviously our hearts continue to be in support with the family. I think it is something that is really hard for all of us to understand and to deal with.\u201d",

      "Linda and Tim Pierce have welcomed a baby boy using a 30-year-old embryo",
      "A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth.",
      "In what's known as embryo adoption, Linda and Tim Pierce used a handful of embryos donated in 1994 in pursuit of having a child after fighting infertility for years. Their son was born Saturday from an embryo that had been in storage for 11,148 days, which the Pierces\u2019 doctor says sets a record.",
      "It\u2019s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home.",
      "\u201cI felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,\u201d said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces.",
      "Just about 2% of births in the U.S. are the result of in vitro fertilization, and an even smaller fraction involve donated embryos.",
      "However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs.",
      "Further complicating the topic is a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that said that frozen embryos have the legal status of children. State leaders have since devised a temporary solution shielding clinics from liability stemming from that ruling, though questions linger about remaining embryos.",
      "Archerd says she turned to IVF in 1994. Back then, the ability to freeze, thaw and transfer embryos was making key progress and opening the door for hopeful parents to create more embryos and increase their chances of a successful transfer.",
      "She wound up with four embryos and initially hoped to use them all. But after the birth of her daughter, Archerd and her husband divorced, disrupting her timeline for having more children.",
      "As the years turned into decades, Archerd said she was wracked with guilt about what to do with the embryos as storage fees continued to rise.",
      "Eventually, she found Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which offers open adoptions to donors that allows people like Archerd. She was also able to set preferences for what families would adopt her embryos.",

      "The process was tricky, requiring Archerd to contact her initial fertility doctor in Oregon and dig through paper records to get the proper documentation for the donation. The embryos then had to be shipped from Oregon to the Pierces\u2019 doctor in Tennessee. The clinic, Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, refuses to discard frozen embryos and has become known for handling embryos stored in outdated and older containers.",
      "Of the three donated embryos the Pierces received from Archerd, one didn\u2019t make the thaw. Two were transferred to Lindsey Pierce\u2019s womb, but just one successfully implanted.",
      "According to Dr. John David Gordon, the transfer of the nearly 31-year-old embryo marks the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. He would know, Gordon says his clinic assisted in the previous record, when Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 30 years, or 10,905 days.",
      "\u201cI think that these stories catch the imagination,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lindsey and Tim Pierce said the clinic\u2019s support was just what they needed.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this thinking about records \u2014 we just wanted to have a baby,\u201d Lindsey Pierce said.",
      "For Archerd, the donation process has been an emotional roller coaster. Relief that her embryos finally found a home, sadness it couldn\u2019t be with her and a little anxiety about what the future holds next, with possibly meeting the Pierces and the baby in person.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019re going to send pictures,\u201d she said, noting that the parents have already sent several after the birth. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet \u2014 meet them and the baby.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is a kingmaker on X",
      "ROME -- Hard-right commentators, politicians and activists in Europe have uncovered a secret to expanding their influence: engaging with Elon Musk.",
      "Take the German politician from a party whose own domestic intelligence agency has designated as extremist. Her daily audience on X surged from 230,000 to 2.2 million on days Musk interacted with her posts. She went on to lead her party to its best-ever electoral showing.",
      "Or the anti-immigration activist in Britain, who was banned from Twitter and sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. Since Musk let him back on the platform in late 2023, he\u2019s mentioned, reposted or replied to the billionaire more than 120 times on X \u2014 and gained nearly a million followers.",
      "Even a little-known social-media influencer turned politician from Cyprus has benefited from the Musk effect. Before winning a surprise seat in the European Parliament, where he\u2019s advocated for Musk, the influencer seemed to have one ambition: to hug the world\u2019s richest man. He got his hug \u2014 and political endorsements. On days Musk has interacted with his account on X, the man\u2019s audience exploded from just over 300,000 to nearly 10 million views.",
      "Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington -- he stepped down as an adviser to President Donald Trump in May and has since traded insults with the president -- but as he works to build his own political party, his power on X his power remains unchecked.",
      "Musk\u2019s influence on the platform he bought for $44 billion has made him a kingmaker at home and abroad. Among those he has chosen to cultivate are hard-right politicians and insurgent influencers across Europe, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data. His dominance, which has real-world financial and political impacts, is fueling concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China this time, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d said Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation. \u201cWe need to make sure that power is not unbalanced.\u201d",
      "In seeking to quantify Musk\u2019s effect on European politics, The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts over a three-year period from 11 far-right European figures across six countries who frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda and had significant interactions with Elon Musk since he purchased Twitter. Tens of thousands of posts by Musk on Twitter, now known as X, were also collected.",
      "The AP used the records, obtained from data provider Bright Data, to analyze how Musk\u2019s account interacted with the European influencers, and vice versa, and the extent to which Musk\u2019s engagement boosted their reach.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather, they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers who share his views.",
      "Due to limitations on data collection, the dataset is not a complete record of all posts made by these accounts. Even so, it captured at least 920 instances in which one of the European accounts tagged, replied or otherwise attempted to interact with Musk\u2019s account, and at nearly 190 instances where Musk\u2019s own posts interacted with the Europeans.",
      "The AP also analyzed records of daily follower counts, using data from Social Blade, to measure any growth in the European accounts\u2019 audience that occurred in the wake of Musk\u2019s online interactions. This kind of analysis is no longer possible. In March, Social Blade removed X from its analytics, saying that X had increased its data access fees to prohibitive levels, making the platform harder to research.",
      "Among those included in AP\u2019s analysis are several people who have run into legal trouble in their own countries. An anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., for example, was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. A German politician was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech. An Italian vice premier was acquitted in December of illegally detaining 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship.",
      "Others examined by AP were an influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right;\u201d a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington, D.C.; and two politicians who have advocated for the interests of Musk\u2019s companies as those firms seek to expand in Europe.",
      "AP\u2019s analysis shows how Musk is helping unite nationalists across borders in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech. While his efforts have sparked backlash in some countries, Musk\u2019s promotion of a growing alliance of hard-right parties and individuals has helped rattle the foundation of a transatlantic bond that has guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Engagement from Musk does not guarantee a surge in followers or page views. But AP found it can have a huge impact, especially on up-and-coming influencers. One account that began with around 120,000 followers when Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 topped 1.2 million by January of this year. Seven other European accounts saw six-figure increases in their follower counts over the same period.",
      "Most of the 11 accounts examined saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers. Even some that grew more steadily on their own before Musk interacted with them saw their follower counts rise sharply after he began engaging with their posts. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, its account saw its views soar \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "Musk is not the only factor influencing the growth of these accounts, of course, but their rising fortunes are a measure of how the platform has evolved under his leadership. When Musk acquired X, he pledged to turn it into a haven for free speech, declaring himself a \u201cfree speech absolutist.\u201d AP\u2019s analysis adds to growing evidence that instead of serving as a neutral forum for free speech, X amplifies Musk\u2019s speech.",
      "This shift has given him sweeping power to direct people\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme asymmetry in the way Musk is able to leverage and shape the platform,\u201d said Timothy Graham, an associate professor in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who has studied data anomalies on X. \u201cThere\u2019s an unequivocal sense when you go onto the site that you\u2019re entering Musk\u2019s kingdom.\u201d",
      "Since he acquired Twitter in 2022, Musk has come to dominate the platform. His followers have more than doubled, to more than 220 million \u2014 growth so tremendous that it easily outpaced the other Top 10 accounts. Not even Taylor Swift has been able to keep up.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose followers grew by 21 million \u2014 or 25% \u2014 from October 2022 through January, clocked a distant second. Donald Trump\u2019s followers grew by 14%, or around 12 million, while Taylor Swift mustered a mere 3% growth, or 3 million new followers.",
      "None of the other Top 10 accounts have shown such consistent follower growth, month after month, AP found. The result is a further concentration of power for the world\u2019s richest man, who now commands the most popular account on a social media platform used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.",
      "Given the opacity of the algorithms that power X, it\u2019s hard to determine with certainty what array of factors might be driving such unusual \u2014 and unusually consistent \u2014 growth in Musk\u2019s account. But researchers who have analyzed data patterns on X argue that the platform\u2019s algorithm has, at times, been altered to amplify Musk\u2019s voice.",
      "How X promotes content is a growing point of contention in Europe. In January, the European Union expanded its investigation of X to assess how the platform pushes content to users and why some material goes viral. In February, French prosecutors opened a separate investigation into X over allegations that Musk changed the platform\u2019s algorithms to promote biased content.",
      "Musk\u2019s public attacks on left-leaning politicians, support for hard-right policies and loose handling of facts have prompted rebukes from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.",
      "X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk\u2019s dominance creates a strong incentive for people seeking to increase their clout \u2014 or their revenues, through the platform\u2019s monetization options \u2014 to exploit these network effects and try to get Musk to engage with their content.",
      "\u201cPeople know that he\u2019s gearing everything towards him,\u201d said Graham, the digital media scholar in Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to get close to this person because he is the moneymaker.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, for example, has benefited from the Musk effect. AfD coleader Alice Weidel helped lead the party, which advocates for nationalist and anti-immigrant policies, to second place in German parliamentary elections in February.",
      "When Musk interacted with her account in the run-up to those elections, the average number of daily views she got rose from about 230,000 to 2.2 million.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in May classified Weidel\u2019s party as a right-wing extremist organization, which would subject the AfD to greater surveillance. The party, which maintains that it\u2019s a victim of politically motivated defamation, promptly filed a lawsuit against the move, which Musk, along with top U.S. officials blasted as an attack on free speech. The designation has been suspended pending judicial review.",

      "The chat has gotten 16 million views. Musk also appeared at AfD rallies and endorsed the party in a German newspaper.",
      "AfD officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Naomi Seibt, a German climate skeptic, pinged Musk nearly 600 times between October 2022 and Jan. 2025. Musk finally engaged in June 2024, when he asked her to explain why the AfD is so controversial in Germany.",
      "Since then, Musk has replied to, quoted or tagged Seibt more than 50 times, and her followers have grown by more than 320,000 since Musk took over the platform. On days Musk interacted with Seibt, her posts, on average, got 2.6 times as many views.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally \u2018invade\u2019 Elon\u2019s algorithm,\u201d Seibt told AP. \u201cObviously Elon has a lot of influence and can help share a message even with those who are usually glued to the legacy media, particularly in Germany.\u201d",

      "Musk has also boosted the influence of political insurgents in the U.K. Days before British national elections last July, Musk took to X to ask Nigel Farage, the leader of the populist Reform U.K. party: \u201cWhy does the media keep calling you far-right? What are your policies?\u201d",
      "Farage replied eagerly: \u201cBecause we believe in family, country and strong borders. Call me!\u201d",

      "In Spain, Rub\u00e9n Pulido, a columnist for a newspaper published by the populist Vox party\u2019s think tank, hit the jackpot in August, when Musk responded to two posts in which he argued that rescue boats operated by nongovernmental organizations effectively help smugglers move migrants to Europe. Pulido\u2019s visibility soared. On days Musk engaged with him, his account got nearly 300,000 views \u2014 roughly three times more than usual.",
      "When Musk didn\u2019t interact with Pulido\u2019s account, the results were just as clear. In January, he again inveighed against migrant rescues and sought to get Musk\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cHi @elonmusk! Speak up,\u201d he urged.",
      "Three weeks later, he tweeted: \u201cPerhaps @elonmusk might find this interesting.\u201d",
      "That post garnered just 5,128 views.",
      "Pulido did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "While Musk helped boost the accounts of such fringe parties and rising influencers, his interactions did not provide as stark a benefit to more established politicians, AP found. That was true for both Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, and Dutch politician Geert Wilders, an anti-Islamic firebrand who has been called the Dutch Donald Trump.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions online have spilled into political endorsements, policy advocacy -- and money.",
      "X helps users monetize their accounts, through ad revenue sharing and paid subscription programs as well as direct fundraising links. That means a surge in attention on X can bring a surge in revenue.",
      "Tommy Robinson, a British anti-immigration agitator who was released from prison in May, after serving a reduced sentence of seven months for contempt of court, has a link to his fundraising page on his X profile. Interactions from Musk more than doubled Robinson\u2019s daily views, from around 380,000 to nearly 850,000. Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 could not be reached for comment",

Radio Genoa has pinged Musk dozens of times over the last three years, and for good reason: On days Musk engaged with him, the views on his account doubled. Radio Genoa\u2019s followers surged from less than 200,000 before Musk\u2019s engagement to over 1.2 million. Radio Genoa could not be reached for comment.",

So does Seibt, the German activist -- though she told AP her earnings from X aren\u2019t enough to sustain herself. Vlaardingerbroek did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk has also advocated for Matteo Salvini, vice premier of Italy and the leader of the hard-right, anti-migrant League party.

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington, D.C., but as he seeks to build a new political party, his power on X \u2014 where he commands the most popular account \u2014 remains unchecked.",
      "Musk is a kingmaker on the platform he acquired in 2022 for $44 billion. He has used his influence to cultivate hard-right politicians and insurgent activists across Europe. A retweet or reply from Musk can lead to millions of views and tens of thousands of new followers, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data.",
      "That fact has not been lost on influencers who have tagged Musk persistently, seeking a reply or a retweet. It has also fueled concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation, told AP.",
      "The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts, which were compiled by Bright Data, over a three-year period from a sample of 11 European figures who had significant interactions with Musk and frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers that share his views.",
      "Since acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Elon Musk\u2019s followers have more than doubled, to over 220 million. No other large account has shown such high or consistent growth.",
      "The result: If Musk\u2019s X account is his megaphone, it has gotten a lot bigger since he took over -- a change that has global implications.",
      "The accounts Musk has been promoting are part of a growing global alliance of nationalistic parties and individuals united in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech, which has rattled the foundation of a trans-Atlantic bond that guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Several of the accounts AP analyzed belong to people who have faced allegations of illegal behavior in their own countries. Tommy Robinson, an anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. Bjoern Hoecke, a politician from Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech.",
      "Italian vice premier Matteo Salvini was acquitted in December of allegations he illegally detained 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship",
      "Among the others examined by AP: Alice Weidel, who helped lead Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party to its best electoral showing this year; Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d; Naomi Seibt, a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington DC; Rub\u00e9n Pulido and Foro Madrid, both associated with Spain\u2019s populist Vox party; and Fidias Panayioutou, a politician from Cyprus who has also advocated for Musk\u2019s companies.",
      "These accounts collectively gained roughly 5 million followers from the time Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 through January of this year. Most saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers -- as high as 920%, or in one case of a tiny account exploding over that time, topping 6,000%. Even some accounts that grew more steadily on their own saw their follower counts sharply begin rising once Musk started interacting with them. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, the number of views the account got soared \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "More established players in Musk\u2019s orbit -- like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots \u2014 benefit less when Musk interacts with them on X, AP found.",

      "A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google\u2019s Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that\u2019s designed to give consumers more choices",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google's Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that's designed to give consumers more choices.",
      "The unanimous ruling issued Thursday by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivers a double-barreled legal blow for Google, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials that resulted in different pillars of its internet empire being declared as domineering scofflaws monopolies since late 2023.",
      "The unsuccessful appeal represents a major victory for video game maker Epic Games, which launched a legal crusade targeting Google\u2019s Play Store for Android apps and Apple\u2019s iPhone app store nearly five years ago in an attempt to bypass exclusive payment processing systems that charged 15% to 30% commissions on in-app transactions.",
      "The jury's December 2023 rebuke of Google's app store for Android-powered smartphones began a cascade of setbacks that includes monopoly judgements against the company's ubiquitous search engine last year and the technology underlying its digital ad network earlier this year.",
      "Although not as lucrative as Google's search engine or ad system, the Play Store for Android apps has long been a gold mine that generated billions of dollars in annual revenue by taking a 15% to 30% cut from in-app transactions funneled through the company's own payment processing system.",
      "Following a month-long trial, a nine-person jury determined that Google had rigged its system to thwart alternative app stores from offering better deals to consumers and software developers. That verdict resulted in U.S. District Judge James Donato ordering Google to tear down digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition, triggering the company's appeal to overturn the jury's finding and void the judge's mandated shakeup.",
      "But a three-judge panel that heard Google's appeal in February rejected its lawyers' contention that Donato erred by allowing the case to be determined by a jury that deviated from the market definition outlined by another federal judge who mostly sided with Apple in Epic's case against the iPhone maker's app store.",
      "Epic's lawsuit \"was replete with evidence that Google\u2019s anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance, causing the Play Store to benefit from network effects,\" the judges wrote in the decision.",

      "Unless Google can extend the enforcement delay placed on Donato's order issued last October, the company will have to begin an overhaul that includes making the Play Store's entire library of more than 2 million Android apps available to would-be rivals and also help distribute the alternative options. Google has argued that the required revisions will raise privacy and security risks by exposing consumers to scam artists and hackers masquerading as legitimate app stores.",
      "But Epic's lawyers have ridiculed Google's warnings about the changes as scare tactics in a desperate attempt to protect the fortunes of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc.",
      "Although Epic fell short in its attempt to have the iPhone's app store declared a monopoly, that case resulted in a judge issuing an order that required Apple to surrender exclusive control over the payment processing of in-app transactions and allow links to alternative systems without collecting a commission.",
      "Besides being hit with Donato's order, Google still faces further trouble ahead that could leave an even bigger dent in its finances.",
      "As part of the effort to address Google\u2019s illegal monopoly in search, a federal judge is weighing a proposal by the U.S. Justice Department that would require the sale of its Chrome web browser and ban the multibillion dollar deals that company has been making with Apple and others to lock-in its search engine as the main gateway to the internet.",
      "Google is also facing a proposed breakup of its advertising technology as part of the countermeasures to its monopoly in that business. A trial on that proposal is scheduled to begin in September.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",

      "MOKOPANE, South Africa -- A South African university launched an anti-poaching campaign Thursday to inject the horns of rhinos with radioactive isotopes that it says are harmless for the animals but can be detected by customs agents.",
      "Under the collaborative project involving the University of the Witwatersrand, nuclear energy officials and conservationists, five rhinos were injected in what the university hopes will be the start of a mass injection of the declining rhino population.",
      "They're calling it the Rhisotope Project.",
      "Last year, about 20 rhinos at a sanctuary were injected with isotopes in trials that paved the way for Thursday's launch. The radioactive isotopes even at low levels can be recognized by radiation detectors at airports and borders, leading to the arrest of poachers and traffickers.",
      "Researchers at Witwatersrand's Radiation and Health Physics Unit say that tests conducted in the pilot study confirmed that the radioactive material was not harmful to the rhinos.",
      "\u201cWe have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,\u201d said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project.",
      "\u201cEven a single horn with significantly lower levels of radioactivity than what will be used in practice successfully triggered alarms in radiation detectors,\u201d said Larkin.",
      "The tests also found that horns could be detected inside full 40-foot shipping containers, he said.",

      "The Department of Defense now says it will continue sharing key data collected by three sophisticated weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes",
      "The U.S. Department of Defense will now continue sharing key data collected by three weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes. Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",
      "Defense officials had planned to cut off distribution of microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, jointly run with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the end of June. At the time, NOAA said the cutoff was said \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" while the U.S. Navy said the program didn't meet \"information technology modernization requirements.\u201d The discontinuation was postponed for one month.",
      "In a notice on Wednesday, officials said there would be no interruption at all.",
      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",
      "The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center. It gives crucial information about storms that can\u2019t be gleaned from conventional visible or infrared satellites.",
      "\u201cThis satellite data enables hurricane forecasters and their computer models to peer inside a hurricane\u2019s structure, offering vital insight,\" said Union of Concerned Scientists science fellow Marc Alessi. \"Make no mistake: this data not only improves hurricane forecasting accuracy, but could make the difference between whether communities evacuate or not ahead of an approaching hurricane.\u201d",
      "Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said \u2014 increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency will continue to have access to the data for the program\u2019s lifespan and noted that it is just one data set \u201cin a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\" that the National Weather Service has at its disposal to \u201censure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",
      "\u201cThe last-minute reprieve has hurricane forecasters breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. \u201cLoss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.\u201d",
      "He added the restoration of the data is also good news for scientists tracking Arctic sea ice loss. Images and microwave satellite data can estimate how much of the ocean is covered by ice, according to NOAA.",

      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative.

You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

      "After recording more than 600 audiobooks, Julia Whelan has become a go-to narrator for books by popular authors including Emily Henry and Taylor Jenkins Reid",
      "Chances are, you've heard Julia Whelan's voice. She's the award-winning narrator behind more than 600 audiobooks by a long list of bestselling authors including Taylor Jenkins Reid,Emily Henry, Michael Crichton, V.E. Schwab and Kristin Hannah. She's also narrated long-form articles for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair.",
      "You may have read her own writing, too. Whelan's first novel, 2018's \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d has been adapted to a Netflix film, out Friday, starring Sofia Carson. The story actually began as a screenplay by Allison Burnett and had been gestating in development for years. Whelan was brought in to help with the script because she had studied abroad at Oxford her junior year of college. Producers then asked if she thought it would make a good book.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing has ever wanted to be a book more. Please let me do this,'\u201d she recalls. It ended up an international bestseller. Her second novel, 2022's \u201cThank You For Listening,\u201d was critically praised. (\u201cThank You For Listening\u201d is about a former actor-turned-audiobook narrator who falls in love with another audiobook narrator.)",
      "You may have even seen Whelan on TV \u2014 she began her career as a child actor, with roles in \u201cFifteen and Pregnant\u201d and on the series \u201cOnce and Again.\u201d Despite her various pursuits, though, she has no plans to leave narration behind. \u201cI feel like I was born to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I love and that I\u2019m good at and everything I want to be doing.\u201d",
      "That's a good thing, because the audiobook industry is growing. Statista projects this year it will reach $9.84 billion because of smartphones, the increased popularity of audio content and people's desire to multitask. Despite the appetite for audiobooks, for narrators, \u201cthe financial aspect makes zero sense,\u201d says Whelan. She's founded her own publishing company, Audiobrary, to help narrators get paid more fairly.",
      "Whelan, who has narrated as many as 70 books in one year, spoke to The Associated Press about the audiobook industry, Audiobrary and her own writing. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

But I think that audiobook fans \u2014 not your casual audiobook user, but fans \u2014 have favorite narrators and they\u2019re going to look for books by those narrators. So, in stunt-casting situations, sometimes someone is incredible at it, and they are perfect for the book. But sometimes it feels like a very craven, just marketing ploy. I don\u2019t feel infringed upon by them, but I do worry about a future situation where most of the work is going to AI.

So then are you telling them they\u2019ve never read a book before? Actual data and studies show that listening to a book actually triggers the same response in the brain as reading it, and that the interpretation and understanding of that book is on par with having read it.",

      "WHELAN: I very much think we could. I have said no up to this point because, this time around, I want to be very creatively involved. There\u2019s just too many things about audiobooks that someone could get wrong not knowing anything about the industry.

But the rise of AI song generators such as Suno and Udio is set to transform the industry because they allow anyone to create songs with just a few prompts.",

      "Is there any sign that the artist or band exists in real life? Are there any upcoming concerts and can you buy a ticket for a gig? Is there footage of past concerts on YouTube? Has an established record label released their singles or albums?",

      "Casual users, though, might prefer to just let the machine write them. So bad rhyming schemes or repetitive lyrical structures might be a clue that a song is not man-made. But it's subjective.",

      "The $1.3 billion mission will help forecasters and first responders stay one step ahead of floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions and other disasters, according to scientists.",
      "Rocketing to orbit from India, the satellite will survey virtually all of Earth\u2019s terrain multiple times. Its two radars \u2014 one from the U.S. and the other from India \u2014 will operate day and night, peering through clouds, rain and foliage to collect troves of data in extraordinary detail.",
      "Microwave signals beamed down to Earth from the dual radars will bounce back up to the satellite\u2019s super-sized antenna reflector perched at the end of a boom like a beach umbrella. Scientists will compare the incoming and outgoing signals as the spacecraft passes over the same locations twice every 12 days, teasing out changes as small as a fraction of an inch (1 centimeter).",
      "\u201cCongratulations India!\u201d India\u2019s minister of science and technology, Jitendra Singh, said via X once the satellite safely reached orbit. The mission \u201cwill benefit the entire world community.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s deputy associate administrator Casey Swails, part of a small delegation that traveled to India for the launch, said it \u201creally shows the world what our two nations can do. But more so than that, it really is a pathfinder for the relationship building,.\u201d",
      "It will take a full week to extend the satellite\u2019s 30-foot (9-meter) boom and open the 39-foot-in-diameter (12-meter) drum-shaped reflector made of gold-plated wire mesh. Science operations should begin by the end of October.",

      "NEW YORK -- An underwater voyage has revealed a network of creatures thriving at the bottom of deep-sea ocean trenches.",
      "In these extreme environments, the crushing pressure, scant food and lack of sunlight can make it hard to survive. Scientists know that tiny microbes prosper there, but less is known about evidence of larger marine life.",
      "Researchers traveling along the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean used a submersible to find tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at over 31,000 feet (9.5 kilometers) deep. The deepest part of the ocean goes down to about 36,000 feet (11 kilometers).",
      "Scientists had surveyed this area before and had hints that larger creatures might live at such depths. The new discovery confirms those suspicions and shows just how extensive the communities are, said Julie Huber, a deep sea microbiologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",
      "\u201cLook how many there are, look how deep they are,\" said Huber, who was not involved with the research. \u201cThey don't all look the same and they're in a place that we haven't had good access to before.\u201d",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",

      "With this discovery, future studies will focus on how these deep-sea creatures adapted to survive in such extreme conditions and how exactly they harness chemical reactions for food, study authors Mengran Du with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Vladimir Mordukhovich with the Russian Academy of Sciences said in a statement.",

      "Stocks tumbled on Friday in response to the sweeping new levies.",
      "U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday in the immediate aftermath of sweeping new tariffs issued by President Donald Trump. A weak jobs report intensified the selloff, as a downward revision of prior estimates indicated a hiring slowdown had begun in May as initial tariffs took hold.",
      "The combination of elevated tariffs and sluggish hiring could hurtle the U.S. toward an economic double-whammy known as \"stagflation,\" in which the economy slows while prices rise, analysts from Moody's Analytics, accounting firm EY and Fitch Ratings told ABC News.",
      "Such a prospect could pose a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which risks heating up inflation further if it lowers interest rates or tipping the U.S. into a recession if it raises rates.",
      "The latest jobs data amounts to a \"bright red flare that the economy is being hurt by the tariff policy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, told ABC News. \"And that's before the tariffs are fully implemented.\"",
      "Trump's executive order late Thursday laid out rates to be applied against nearly 70 countries, ranging from 10% to 41% in what a Trump administration official hailed as the beginning of a \"new system of trade.\" The new duties are now set to go into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The new levies hiked the average effective tariff rate to 18.3%, the highest since 1934, the Yale Budget Lab said.",

      "The U.S. added 73,000 jobs in July, which came in well below an average of 130,000 jobs added each month this year, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).",
      "The report also provided new estimates for two previous months, significantly dropping the government's estimate of jobs added in May and June. Over those two months, the U.S. added a combined 33,000 jobs, much lower than a previous estimate of 286,000 jobs, BLS data showed.",

      "NEW YORK -- The National Science Foundation can continue to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars from researchers in several states until litigation aimed at restoring it plays out, a federal court ruled Friday.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Cronan in New York declined to force the NSF to restart payments immediately, while the case is still being decided, as requested by the sixteen Democrat-led states who brought the suit, including New York, Hawaii, California, Colorado and Connecticut.",
      "In his ruling, Cronan said he would not grant the preliminary injunction in part because it may be that another court, the Court of Federal Claims, has jurisdiction over what is essentially a case about money. He also said the states failed to show that NSF\u2019s actions were counter to the agency's mandate.",
      "The lawsuit filed in May alleges that the National Science Foundation's new grant-funding priorities as well as a cap on what's known as indirect research expenses \u201cviolate the law and jeopardize America\u2019s longstanding global leadership in STEM.\u201d",
      "Another district court had already blocked the the cap on indirect costs \u2014 administrative expenses that allow research to get done like paying support staff and maintaining equipment. This injunction had been requested to restore funding to the grants that were cut.",
      "In April, the NSF announced a new set of priorities and began axing hundreds of grants for research focused on things like misinformation and diversity, equity and inclusion. Researchers who lost funding also were studying artificial intelligence, post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans, STEM education for K-12 students and more.",
      "Researchers were not given a specific explanation for why their grants were canceled, attorney Colleen Faherty, representing the state of New York, said during last month's hearing. Instead, they received boilerplate language stating that their work \u201cno longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.\"",
      "NSF has long been directed by Congress to encourage underrepresented groups like women and people with disabilities to participate in STEM. According to the lawsuit, the science foundation's funding cuts already halted efforts to train the next generation of scientists in fields like computer science, math and environmental science.",

The two sides haven\u2019t come to agreement yet, and it\u2019s still unclear if Trump, who has been publicly calling on Republicans to cancel their break, would be onboard with any bipartisan deal.",
      "Thune said Friday he was leaving some of the negotiations to Trump and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how this is going to get resolved,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where that leads.\u201d",
      "Senators in both parties are eager to leave Washington for their annual break, when many of them tour their states to talk to constituents. Republicans in particular are eager to return home and sell the massive tax and spending cuts package they passed in July as Democrats vow to use it against them in the 2026 midterm elections. The House, which has no role in the confirmation process, fled Washington a week ago.",
      "But Trump has other plans.",
      "\u201cThe Senate must stay in Session, taking no recess, until the entire Executive Calendar is CLEAR!!!\u201d Trump posted on social media Thursday night, after a meeting with Thune at the White House. \u201cWe have to save our Country from the Lunatic Left. Republicans, for the health and safety of the USA, DO YOUR JOB, and confirm All Nominees.\u201d",
      "Thune said this week that Republicans are considering changing the Senate's rules when they get back in September to make it easier to quickly approve a president\u2019s nominations \u2014 and to try and avoid a similar stalemate in the future. Democrats have blocked more nominees than usual this year, denying any quick unanimous consent votes and forcing roll calls on each one, a lengthy process that takes several days per nominee and allows for debate time.",

      "Democrats have little desire to give in, even though they too are eager to skip town after several long months of work and bitter partisan fights over legislation.

Both parties have increasingly used stalling tactics to delay confirmations that were once quick, bipartisan and routine. In 2013, Democrats changed Senate rules for lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations as Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial nominations. In 2017, Republicans did the same for Supreme Court nominees as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have drawn expressions of relief from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April",
      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries drew expressions of relief Friday from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others expressed disappointment or frustration over running out of time after hitting Trump's Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America\u2019s trading partners.",
      "The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7, but uncertainty over what Trump might do next remains. The way ahead for China, which runs the largest trade surplus with the U.S., is unclear after talks earlier this week in Stockholm produced no deal. Trump has yet to say if he'll extend an Aug. 12 pause on painfully high import duties on Chinese products.",
      "The reaction from financial markets was muted. Benchmarks fell in Asia, with South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping nearly 4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at more than 150 yen per dollar.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government was disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.",
      "Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.",
      "\u201cCanada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\u201d Carney said in a statement.",
      "Many of Canada's exports to the U.S. are covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and face no tariff. But steel, lumber, aluminum and autos have been subject to still higher tariffs.",
      "Switzerland was reeling after Trump ordered a 39% tariff rate for the land of luxury watches, pharmaceuticals and financial services. That was up from his original proposal of a 31% duty.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Council notes with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland\u2019s very constructive stance from the outset, the U.S. intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland,\u201d the government said in a post on X. It said it would continue to seek a negotiated solution.",
      "New Zealand officials said Friday they would keep lobbying Trump to cut the 15% tariff he announced for their country\u2019s exports to the U.S., up from the original 10% baseline set in April.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a good thing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Trade Minister Todd McClay told Radio New Zealand. The exporter of meat, dairy, wine and farm machinery ran a $1.1 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, according to U.S. Trade Representative data.",
      "McClay said New Zealand exporters had reported they could absorb a 10% tariff or pass it on to U.S. consumers through increased costs. A further increase would \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said.",

      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has executed more people so far this year than any other state, setting a new state record",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- In the final moments of a life defined by violence, 60-year-old Edward Zakrzewski thanked the people of Florida for killing him \"in the most cold, calculated, clean, humane, efficient way possible,\" breathing deeply as a lethal drug cocktail coursed through his veins.",
      "With his last breath, strapped to a gurney inside a state prison's death chamber, Zakrzewski paid what Florida had deemed was his debt to society and became the 27th person put to death in the U.S. so far this year, the highest number in a decade.",
      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has executed nine people in 2025, more than than any other state, and set a new state record, with DeSantis overseeing more executions in a single year than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.",
      "Across the country, more people have been put to death in the first seven months of this year than in all of 2024. Florida's increase is helping put the U.S. on track to surpass 2015\u2019s total of 28 executions.",
      "And the number of executions is expected to keep climbing. Nine more people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025.",
      "After the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in the \u201970s, executions steadily increased, peaking in 1999 at 98 deaths. Since then, they had been dropping \u2014 in part due to legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs, and declining public support for capital punishment, which has prompted a majority of states to either pause or abolish it altogether.",
      "The ratcheting up after this yearslong decline comes as Republican President Donald Trump has urged prosecutors to aggressively seek the death penalty and as some GOP-controlled state legislatures have pushed to expand the category of crimes punishable by death and the methods used to carry out executions.",
      "John Blume, director of the Cornell Death Penalty Project, says the uptick in executions doesn\u2019t appear to be linked to a change in public support for the death penalty or an increase in the rate of death sentences, but is rather a function of the discretion of state governors.",
      "\u201cThe most cynical view would be: It seems to matter to the president, so it matters to them,\u201d Blume said of the governors.",
      "In response to questions from The Associated Press, a spokesperson for DeSantis pointed to statements the governor made at a press conference in May, saying he takes capital cases \u201cvery seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are some crimes that are just so horrific, the only appropriate punishment is the death penalty,\u201d DeSantis said, adding: \u201cthese are the worst of the worst.\u201d",

      "\u201cAny time we go forward, I\u2019m convinced that not only was the verdict correct, but that this punishment is absolutely appropriate under the circumstances,\u201d DeSantis said.",
      "For years, the U.S. has ranked alongside Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt as among the countries carrying out the highest number of confirmed executions. China is thought to execute more of its citizens than any other nation, although the exact totals are considered a state secret, according to the non-profit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Robin Maher, the center's executive director, says elected officials in the U.S. have long used the death penalty as a \u201cpolitical tool,\u201d adding it\u2019s \u201ca way of embellishing their own tough-on-crime credentials.\u201d",
      "In 2024, DeSantis signed one death warrant. From 2020-2022, Florida didn\u2019t carry out a single execution. In 2023, DeSantis oversaw six \u2014 the highest number during his time in office until this year. 2023 was also the year the governor challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Democrats still in the dumps over last year's elections have found cause for optimism in North Carolina, where former Gov. Roy Cooper jumped into the race for that state's newly open seat with a vow to address voters' persistent concerns about the challenges of making ends meet.",
      "Even Republicans quietly note that Cooper\u2019s candidacy makes their job of holding the seat more difficult and expensive. Cooper had raised $2.6 million for his campaign between his Monday launch and Tuesday, and more than $900,000 toward allied groups.",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, are hardly ceding the economic populist ground. In announcing his candidacy for the Senate on Thursday, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley credited President Donald Trump with fulfilling campaign promises to working Americans and painted Cooper as a puppet of the left.",
      "Still, Cooper\u2019s opening message that he hears the worries of working families has given Democrats in North Carolina and beyond a sense that they can reclaim their place as the party that champions the middle class. They think it's a message that could help them pick up a Senate seat, and possibly more, in next year's midterm elections, which in recent years have typically favored the party out of power.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Roy Cooper. And I know that today, for too many Americans, the middle class feels like a distant dream,\u201d the former governor said in a video announcing his candidacy. \u201cMeanwhile, the biggest corporations and the richest Americans have grabbed unimaginable wealth at your expense. It\u2019s time for that to change.\u201d",
      "Cooper's plainspoken appeal may represent just the latest effort by Democrats to find their way back to power, but it has some thinking they've finally found their footing after last year's resounding losses.",
      "\u201cI think it would do us all a lot of good to take a close look at his example,\u201d said Larry Grisolano, a Chicago-based Democratic media strategist and former adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Whatley, a former North Carolina GOP chairman and close Trump ally, used his Thursday announcement that he was entering the race to hail the president as the true champion of the middle class. He said Trump had already fulfilled promises to end taxes on tips and overtime and said Cooper was out of step with North Carolinians.",
      "\u201cSix months in, it's pretty clear to see, America is back,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cA healthy, robust economy, safe kids and communities and a strong America. These are the North Carolina values that I will champion if elected.\u201d",
      "Still, the decision by Cooper, who held statewide office for 24 years and has never lost an election, makes North Carolina a potential bright spot in a midterm election cycle when Democrats must net four seats to retake the majority \u2014 and when most of the 2026 Senate contests are in states Trump won comfortably last November.",
      "State Rep. Cynthia Ball threw up a hand in excitement when asked Monday at the North Carolina Legislative Building about Cooper\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cEveryone I\u2019ve spoken to was really hoping that he was going to run,\u201d said the Raleigh Democrat.",
      "Democratic legislators hope having Cooper\u2019s name at the top of the ballot will encourage higher turnout and help them in downballot races. While Republicans have controlled both General Assembly chambers since 2011, Democrats managed last fall to end the GOP\u2019s veto-proof majority, if only by a single seat.",
      "Republican strategists familiar with the national Senate landscape have said privately that Cooper poses a formidable threat.",

      "A California judge is extending migrant status protections ended by the Trump administration for more than 60,000 people from Central America and Nepal",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration's plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.",
      "Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It's part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them.",
      "The secretary said the two countries had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in recovering from 1998's Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.",
      "The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8.",
      "U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.",
      "In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an \u201cobjective review of the country conditions\u201d such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.",
      "If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy.",
      "\u201cThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,\u201d Thompson said.",

      "Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the \"discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.\u201d",

      "Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump called Powell \u201cstubborn.\" The Fed chair has been subjected to vicious verbal attacks by the Republican president over several months.",
      "The Fed has the responsibility of stabilizing prices and maximizing employment. Powell has held its benchmark rate for overnight loans constant this year, saying that Fed officials needed to see what impact Trump's massive tariffs had on inflation.",

      "Trump has called for slashing the Fed's benchmark rate by 3 percentage points, bringing it down dramatically from its current average of 4.33%. The risk is that a rate cut that large could cause more money to come into the economy than can be absorbed, possibly causing inflation to accelerate.",

      "Edward Leon, 52, was charged with malicious use of fire to destroy property resulting in death, a crime that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He pleaded not guilty during a hearing in federal court in Albany on Thursday, two days after the grand jury indicted him. Records of the case were unsealed Thursday.",
      "The fire on May 2, 2013, in Schenectady, killed David Terry, 3-year-old Layah Terry, 2-year-old Michael Terry, and 11-month-old Donavan Duell. Another child, Sa\u2019fyre Terry, who was 5 at the time, was seriously injured. Investigators said gasoline was used to start the blaze.",
      "It was not clear why Leon was charged so many years after the fire. His lawyer, Kevin Luibrand, did not immediately return phone and email messages Friday. Schenectady police and the U.S. attorney's office did not respond to questions about the investigation.",
      "In 2016, Leon was sentenced to 10 years in prison for lying to a grand jury about his actions and whereabouts on the night of the fire. He was released in 2022, federal prison records show. Several other people were sentenced to prison for lying under oath before a grand jury, including the mother of the children who died.",
      "In a 2016 court document, a federal prosecutor said there was \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of Leon's involvement in the deadly fire. Leon was upset that David Terry planned to marry Leon's ex-girlfriend, according to the document, and had sent Terry threatening text messages including \u201cyou\u2019re not going to make it to your wedding day,\u201d \u201cdie, Dave, die,\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re a dead man walking.\"",

But he said he left the scene when he noticed a fire at the home \u2014 worrying that people would blame him \u2014 and did not report the fire to authorities, according to prosecutors.",

Officials said further investigation was needed about the possible involvement of others, and there were issues with eyewitnesses.",
      "The Times Union of Albany reported that it obtained street camera video footage in 2014 that showed Leon\u2019s van entering the neighborhood in the early morning, minutes before the fire began. The newspaper also reported that Butler's public defender showed authorities video footage at the time, and officials responded that it could have been a coincidence that Leon was near the home.",

      "America\u2019s rural high school students are less likely to go to college than their urban and suburban peers",
      "PERRY, N.Y. -- As a student in western New York's rural Wyoming County, Briar Townes honed an artistic streak that he hopes to make a living from one day. In high school, he clicked with a college-level drawing and painting class.",
      "But despite the college credits he earned, college isn't part of his plan.",
      "Since graduating from high school in June, he has been overseeing an art camp at the county's Arts Council. If that doesn't turn into a permanent job, there is work at Creative Food Ingredients, known as the \u201ccookie factory\u201d for the way it makes the town smell like baking cookies, or at local factories like American Classic Outfitters, which designs and sews athletic uniforms.",
      "\u201cMy stress is picking an option, not finding an option,\u201d he said.",
      "Even though rural students graduate from high school at higher rates than their peers in cities and suburbs, fewer of them go on to college.",
      "Many rural school districts, including the one in Perry that Townes attends, have begun offering college-level courses and working to remove academic and financial obstacles to higher education, with some success. But college doesn't hold the same appeal for students in rural areas where they often would need to travel farther for school, parents have less college experience themselves, and some of the loudest political voices are skeptical of the need for higher education.",
      "College enrollment for rural students has remained largely flat in recent years, despite the district-level efforts and stepped-up recruitment by many universities. About 55% of rural U.S. high school students who graduated in 2023 enrolled in college, according to National Clearinghouse Research Center data. That's compared to 64% of suburban graduates and 59% of urban graduates.",
      "College can make a huge difference in earning potential. An American man with a bachelor\u2019s degree earns an estimated $900,000 more over his lifetime than a peer with a high school diploma, research by the Social Security Administration has found. For women, the difference is about $630,000.",
      "A lack of a college degree is no obstacle to opportunity in places such as Wyoming County, where people like to say there are more cows than people. The dairy farms, potato fields and maple sugar houses are a source of identity and jobs for the county just east of Buffalo.",
      "\u201cCollege has never really been, I don\u2019t know, a necessity or problem in my family,\u201d said Townes, the middle of three children whose father has a tattoo shop in Perry.",
      "At Perry High School, Superintendent Daryl McLaughlin said the district takes cues from students like Townes, their families and the community, supplementing college offerings with programs geared toward career and technical fields such as the building trades. He said he is as happy to provide reference checks for employers and the military as he is to write recommendations for college applications.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re letting our students know these institutions, whether it is a college or whether employers, they\u2019re competing for you,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is now setting them up for success so that they can take the greatest advantage of that competition, ultimately, to improve their quality of life.\u201d",
      "Still, college enrollment in the district has exceeded the national average in recent years, going from 60% of the class of 2022\u2019s 55 graduates to 67% of 2024's and 56% of 2025's graduates. The district points to a decision to direct federal pandemic relief money toward covering tuition for students in its Accelerated College Enrollment program \u2014 a partnership with Genesee Community College. When the federal money ran out, the district paid to keep it going.",
      "\u201cThis is a program that\u2019s been in our community for quite some time, and it\u2019s a program our community supports,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "About 15% of rural U.S. high school students were enrolled in college classes in January 2025 through such dual enrollment arrangements, a slightly lower rate than urban and suburban students, an Education Department survey found.",
      "Rural access to dual enrollment is a growing area of focus as advocates seek to close gaps in access to higher education. The College in High School Alliance this year announced funding for seven states to develop policy to expand programs for rural students.",

      "Paper mills and power plants provide opportunities for a middle class life in the county, where the cost of living is low. But Theobold tells students the goal of higher education \u201cis to go off and learn more about not only the world, but also about yourself.\u201d",

      "Two previous days of testimony underscored a number of factors that likely contributed to the collision that left all 67 people aboard both aircrafts dead, sparking Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy to urge the Federal Aviation Administration to \u201cdo better\" as she pointed to warnings the agency ignored years earlier.",

      "The January collision was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "The board focused on air traffic control and heard Thursday that it was common for pilots to ask to use visual separation or relying on their eyesight just as the Army Black Hawk\u2019s pilots, who were wearing night vision goggles, agreed to do the night of the crash.",
      "FAA officials also said controllers relied heavily on pilots using visual separation as a way to manage the complex airspace with so many helicopters flying around Washington D.C.",
      "But Rick Dressler, an official with medevac operator Metro Aviation, told the board it is difficult to identify other aircraft in the night sky around Ronald Reagan National Airport, especially if a key onboard locator system was switched off, as Army choppers routinely did.",
      "Dressler said that he and other civilian helicopter pilots in the area have long been concerned about the Army and Air Force helicopters flying around Reagan airport.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like saying this. I\u2019ll say it again on the record,\u201d Dressler, a former Army aviator and retired Air Force officer, said. \u201cI\u2019m speaking for my group there. We we are all very uncomfortable when those two units are operating.\u201d",
      "The Department of Defense referred questions about Thursday\u2019s testimony to the Army, which did not immediately respond. Army officials at the hearing did ask Dressler to elaborate on his concerns and consider visiting the Pentagon to share them.",
      "Dressel said part of what worries him is the relative lack of experience of the military pilots who may have only been in the area a short time and don\u2019t understand the complex airspace around Washington D.C.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t get the seasoning here to really, truly understand how the airspace works,\u201d said Dressel, who also complained that the Army helicopter unit no longer participates in regular meetings with all the other aviators in the area to discuss issues.",

But when the controller instructed the pilots to \u201cpass behind\u201d the jet, the crew didn\u2019t hear that instruction because the Black Hawk\u2019s microphone key was pressed at that moment.",

      "CEDARTOWN, Ga. -- A federal receiver is on the hunt to recover $140 million lost in an alleged Ponzi scheme that benefited some Republicans in the top ranks of their party in Georgia and Alabama. He's looking to claw back funds, including almost 1,000 political donations totaling more than $1 million, that often backed far-right Republican insurgents.",
      "Some of these same politicians say they too lost money, but others left holding the bag for First Liberty Building & Loan are rank-and-file conservatives, swayed by talk show pundits who promoted it as an opportunity for Christians and \u201cAmerica First MAGA patriots.\u201d",
      "\u201cI worked my whole life to build up savings and have a little bit of retirement so I could just live comfortably,\u201d said Michael Tinney, a 59-year-old real estate broker from Cedartown, Georgia. Tinney said he deposited $600,000 after hearing First Liberty pitched on shows hosted by conservatives including Erick Erickson, Hugh Hewitt and Charlie Kirk.",
      "First Liberty had promised returns up to 16% by making high-interest loans to businesses. Brant Frost IV, an evangelical powerbroker, touted \u201cWall Street returns for Main Street investors.\u201d But he skimmed $17 million for himself, his relatives and their affiliated companies, and loaned millions more that borrowers never repaid, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit claims.",

Tinney said the younger Frost drove to his office to secure his investment.",
      "According to a July 21 report from court-appointed receiver S. Gregory Hays, assets now include just $1.2 million in cash along with some Frost family real estate.",
      "Hays told The Associated Press it's too early to estimate how much money is recoverable, but he's moving to foreclose on collateral pledged by borrowers who defaulted, including a failed South Carolina factory. Hays also seized and plans to auction Brant Frost IV's Aston Martin sports car. A social media post celebrating that 2022 purchase is particularly scorned by angry investors.",
      "But Hays doubts he can get everything back.",
      "\u201cThe investors are going to have substantial losses here,\u201d he said.",
      "Georgia and Alabama also are investigating. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urged politicians to return campaign cash. Hays said he's already received $110,000, plus a returned $20,000 charitable donation.",
      "Frost said on July 11 that he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d and would \u201cspend the rest of my life trying to repay as much as I can to the many people I misled and let down.\u201d",
      "But no criminal charges have been announced, and some Frost relatives retain influential positions in the Georgia Republican Party, whose chairman, Josh McKoon, has had the Frosts' political and financial support. McKoon said the party returned nearly $37,000 in Frost donations and he\u2019s \u201cprofoundly saddened that members of our conservative movement\u201d lost money.",
      "Campaign disclosures show First Liberty, the Frosts and associated companies contributed widely to Republican causes, including more than $700,000 in Georgia, $150,000 in Alabama and nearly $140,000 in Maine, where the Frosts spent $230,000 over multiple years renting a Kennebunkport vacation home.",
      "Georgia donations included $1,000 to former party chairman David Shafer\u2019s unsuccessful 2018 lieutenant governor campaign, and tens of thousands to the state party.

Its attorney, Brent Herrin, said the company is \u201cone of hundreds of defrauded investors.\u201d Herrin declined to confirm Shafer owns the company, but financial disclosures show Shafer in 2017 owned at least part of Springwood Capital's parent company.

      "President Donald Trump's economic policies are facing scrutiny as weak indicators emerge",
      "WASHINGTON -- For all of President Donald Trump\u2019s promises of an economic \u201cgolden age,\u201d a spate of weak indicators this week told a potentially worrisome story as the impacts of his policies are coming into focus.",
      "Job gains are dwindling. Inflation is ticking upward. Growth has slowed compared to last year.",
      "More than six months into his term, Trump\u2019s blitz of tariff hikes and his new tax and spending bill have remodeled America\u2019s trading, manufacturing, energy and tax systems to his own liking. He\u2019s eager to take credit for any wins that might occur and is hunting for someone else to blame if the financial situation starts to totter.",
      "But as of now, this is not the boom the Republican president promised, and his ability to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any economic challenges has faded as the world economy hangs on his every word and social media post.",
      "When Friday\u2019s jobs report turned out to be decidedly bleak, Trump ignored the warnings in the data and fired the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs figures.",
      "\u201cImportant numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can\u2019t be manipulated for political purposes,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social, without offering evidence for his claim. \u201cThe Economy is BOOMING.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s possible that the disappointing numbers are growing pains from the rapid transformation caused by Trump and that stronger growth will return \u2014 or they may be a preview of even more disruption to come.",
      "Trump's aggressive use of tariffs, executive actions, spending cuts and tax code changes carries significant political risk if he is unable to deliver middle-class prosperity. The effects of his new tariffs are still several months away from rippling through the economy, right as many Trump allies in Congress will be campaigning in the midterm elections.",
      "\u201cConsidering how early we are in his term, Trump\u2019s had an unusually big impact on the economy already,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist at Firehouse Strategies. \u201cThe full inflationary impact of the tariffs won\u2019t be felt until 2026. Unfortunately for Republicans, that\u2019s also an election year.\u201d",
      "The White House portrayed the blitz of trade frameworks leading up to Thursday's tariff announcement as proof of his negotiating prowess. The European Union, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and other nations that the White House declined to name agreed that the U.S. could increase its tariffs on their goods without doing the same to American products. Trump simply set rates on other countries that lacked settlements.",
      "The costs of those tariffs \u2014 taxes paid on imports to the U.S. \u2014 will be most felt by many Americans in the form of higher prices, but to what extent remains uncertain.",
      "\u201cFor the White House and their allies, a key part of managing the expectations and politics of the Trump economy is maintaining vigilance when it comes to public perceptions,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist.",
      "Just 38% of adults approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, according to a July poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That\u2019s down from the end of Trump\u2019s first term when half of adults approved of his economic leadership.",
      "The White House paints a rosier image, seeing the economy emerging from a period of uncertainty after Trump\u2019s restructuring and repeating the economic gains seen in his first term before the pandemic struck.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale \u2013 as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said.",

      "\u201cHe seems determined to impose steep, universal tariffs on all imported goods brought into this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs rather than the American consumer,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI believe this approach is a major mistake.\u201d",

      "Jeannie Seely, the soulful country music singer behind such standards like \"Don't Touch Me,\" has died. She was 85.",
      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \"Miss Country Soul\" for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the '60s and '70s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\"Rehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\" she said in a statement at the time. \"The unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\"",
      "Dolly Parton was one of several country music luminaries paying her tribute on Friday, saying she met Seely when they were both young and starting out in Nashville.",
      "\"She was one of my dearest friends,\" Parton said on her social media accounts. \"I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.\"",
      "Singer Charlie Daniels said on X that Seely was \"a national treasure, and one fine lady.\"",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

      "Former Food Network star Paula Deen announced Friday the abrupt closure of the Savannah restaurant that launched her to fame with its menu of fried chicken, banana pudding and other indulgent Southern dishes.",
      "Deen ran The Lady & Sons restaurant with her two sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen, for nearly three decades. Loyal fans visiting Savannah continued to line up for Deen's buffet long after the Food Network canceled her show, \"Paula's Home Cooking,\" in 2013.",
      "But 78-year-old Deen said Friday that The Lady & Sons closed for good along with her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. A statement posted on Deen's website and social media accounts didn't say why the restaurants had shut down.",
      "\"Hey, y'all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,\" Deen's statement said.",
      "\"Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,\" she said. \"We have endless love and gratitude for every customer who has walked through our doors.\"",
      "Deen said her four restaurants outside Savannah will remain open. They're located in Nashville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Branson, Missouri.",
      "Deen said Friday she and her sons will visit the Branson establishment on Aug. 8, and said the family is \"excited to continue visiting these restaurants regularly.\"",
      "\"Savannah will always be our home, and we'll always be here to support our wonderful community,\" she said in the statement.",
      "Hey, y\u2019all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady...",
      "Windows at The Lady & Sons were covered with brown paper on Friday. Signs posted at the front entrance read: \"It is with heavy hearts and tremendous gratitude that we announce that we have retired and closed.\"",
      "Martin Rowe works in a downtown office across the street from Deen's restaurant. He said business seemed to be going strong up until it closed.",
      "\"Nobody knew anything was wrong,\" Rowe said. \"I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.\"",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",
      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",
      "Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted \"Paula's Home Cooking\" in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.",
      "The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public, which included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.",
      "Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, \"Yes, of course,\" though she added: \"It's been a very long time.\"",
      "Deen returned to television on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars,\" on chef Gordon Ramsay's Fox show \"MasterChef: Legends,\" and on Fox Nation, which began streaming \"At Home With Paula Deen\" in 2020. She also posts cooking videos to a YouTube channel that has more than 520,000 subscribers.",

      "\"Amy Bradley is Missing,\" directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, explores the unsolved case that has puzzled investigators for nearly three decades. Bradley disappeared from her family's cruise, leaving behind numerous theories but few concrete answers.",
      "\"The Amy Bradley story is something if you've been around the genre, you know about it,\" Mark said. \"It's one of the most baffling mysteries of a disappearance case.\"",
      "The case presents multiple scenarios for what may have happened to Bradley. The film floats several theories: she could have accidentally fallen overboard, committed suicide or been the victim of foul play. Investigators have noted that the sliding door to her balcony was found ajar, raising questions about whether she left voluntarily or was taken against her will.",
      "Mark and Lott said they were drawn to the story after learning that existing coverage barely scratched the surface of the case. After meeting with Bradley's parents, Ron and Iva Bradley, in Virginia, the directors realized the family deserved justice.",
      "\"These are people who are living with such pain every single day,\" Lott said. \"It's a very real hope and possibility every single day that they could bring Amy home.\"",
      "The documentary has generated new tips since its Netflix release, though the directors declined to share details publicly. They emphasized the importance of carefully vetting information and involving law enforcement in any potential leads.",
      "One challenge in the case has been witnesses who claim to have seen Bradley over the years but didn't come forward until long after her disappearance. The directors said many people don't realize the significance of what they witnessed until later connecting it to Bradley's story through media coverage.",

    "story": [
      "A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers, made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \"baby parade.\"",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump's administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don't have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies' lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician, associate dean for public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breastfeeding supplies and baby clothes, but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \"baby bonuses,\" a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that it doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",

    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett's\u00a0company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in\u00a0Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it must record the current value of its massive investment portfolio, even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprised shareholders by\u00a0selling off\u00a0a huge chunk of its Apple stake, which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it has had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft's core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",
      "Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to\u00a0give up the CEO title\u00a0at the end of the year and hand over operations to\u00a0Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman.",
      "Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement.",
      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after\u00a0rival Union Pacific announced\u00a0a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with Eastern Rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\"He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\" Seifert said. \"I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn't been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there's a logical case to be made they'll accept it.\"",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",

Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",

      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended President Trump's decision to fire a key official responsible for employment reports, telling CBS News on Friday that Mr. Trump has \"real concerns\" about the accuracy of federal economic data.",
      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",
      "Instead, Greer argued that the numbers reflect conditions prior to the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed through Congress last month. He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

    "summary": "Trade experts say the Trump administration's barrage of new tariffs could raise prices for consumers and cause headaches for businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order hiking tariffs on U.S. imports could drive up consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for millions of businesses, trade experts said.",
      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",
      "\"For the average shopper, the effects don't always show up as a big price hike on the shelf. Instead, it's subtler \u2014 fewer options, smaller quantities and less generous promotions,\" he said. \"Companies are quietly reducing [their stockpiles], reworking product specs or stripping out expensive components to hit margin targets.\"",

      "Factoring in the downward revisions, the three-month average employment gain from May to June was 35,000, compared to an average of 123,000 from January to April.",
      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cuts in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners are weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",
      "Beyond the ups and down of the job market, meanwhile, many Americans are struggling in an economy bifurcated between rich and poor.",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview. \"At the bottom end of the spectrum, what I hear when I'm out in the district is I hear a lot of struggle. I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef. They're buying hot dogs.\"",
      "The latest job numbers could spur Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next meeting in September, according to economists. The central bank opted this week to\u00a0hold its benchmark rate steady. President Trump has pushed for a rate cut, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers remain cautious about lowering rates until the impact of tariffs on the economy is clear.",
      "\"With this morning's payroll miss \u2014 and the downward revisions that came with it \u2014 the Fed will again need to balance a slowing job market with inflation which isn't slowing fast enough,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "According to CME FedWatch, investors see a roughly 77% probability of a Fed cut at the Fed's Sept. 16-17 meeting.",

    "summary": "The advent of AI in the workplace is one factor behind a spike in layoffs this year, new labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "In July alone, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",
      "\"We are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by DOGE impact non-profits and health care in addition to the government,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "Layoffs are also accelerating in the vast retail sector as tariffs raise the cost of doing business, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have announced more than 80,000 cuts through July, up nearly 250% compared to the same period last year, the firm found.",
      "\"Retailers are being impacted by tariffs, inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty causing layoffs and store closures. Further declines in consumer spending could trigger additional losses,\" the group said.",

    "summary": "Millions of borrowers in forbearance through the SAVE plan will see interest start accruing on Friday. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who had signed up for a Biden-era repayment plan will start seeing interest accrue to their accounts starting today, Aug. 1, a change that could result in an additional $300 in monthly costs for the typical borrower, according to one analysis.",
      "The Department of Education announced on July 9 that it planned to restart charging interest for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created by the Biden administration in 2023 to help lighten the financial burden faced by millions of student loan borrowers.",
      "But two courts last year issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively halting the repayment program. In response, the Biden administration moved all of the SAVE plan's enrollees into zero-interest forbearance, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "The Education Department says resuming interest on the loans represents a measure of \"fiscal responsibility,\" according to its July 9 statement. But the monetary impact on the roughly 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan could be significant, given that a typical borrower could see an increase of $300 per month due to new interest charges, according to a calculation by the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with higher-education debt.",
      "SAVE enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance, which means they won't need to make monthly payments, but \"the most significant impact is that your total loan balance will start growing again\" because interest will resume, Bethany Hubert, a financial aid specialist at lender Earnest, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"If you choose not to make payments, the accruing interest can really balloon your balance, making it much more challenging and expensive to pay back over time.\"",
      "How much will my payment increase?",
      "While the typical borrower could see costs increase by about $300 per month, or $3,500 per year, the specific increase will depend on your loan balance.",
      "Borrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the\u00a0loan simulator\u00a0on the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said, although she noted that it might not yet include all the recent changes impacting student loans.",
      "Should I change repayment plans?",
      "Borrowers should evaluate the four repayment plans available, which can be found at here at the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said.",
      "Changing plans will depend on your situation, added Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit that provides free advice for student borrowers.",
      "Borrowers who are seeking loan forgiveness, which can be earned after repaying a loan for anywhere from 10 years to 25 years, depending on the plan, may want switch because \"the SAVE forbearance doesn't count towards the payments needed to get the balance forgiven under those plans,\" she said.",
      "What about the new Repayment Assistance Plan?",
      "There's also a new repayment plan in the works that borrowers could consider, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which is due in 2026 and is part of the \"big beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4.",
      "\"For earners who make less than $10,000, their [monthly] payment will be $10 under RAP,\" Hubert said.",
      "For those with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $10,000 per year, the repayments will be based on 1% to 10% of their income minus $50 in payments each month for each child the borrower has. \"With that in mind, we can estimate that a borrower who has an AGI of $45,000 and no children would have their monthly payment set at $150,\" she added.",
      "RAP payments could carry a higher monthly payment for some borrowers than under the SAVE plan, but the SAVE plan is likely to eventually be eliminated due to the court cases, Mayotte said.",
      "\"At a minimum, I would suggest trying to make payments that cover the monthly interest as it begins to accrue to prevent your balance from growing,\" Hubert added.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday the new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately.",
      "Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, as well.",
      "In announcing the hike in Canadian tariffs, White House said Canada hadn't done enough to \"arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\"",
      "In a statement released early Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\" he said.",
      "Carney added that some industries - including lumber, steel, aluminum and automobiles - are \"heavily impacted by U.S. duties and tariffs. For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversity our export markets.\"",
      "In Beijing, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Friday that, \"China's opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no one's interests.\"",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Global financial markets fell in overnight trading after the White House tariff announcement. In the U.S., stock futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex were each down 0.9%, while Nasdaq Composite futures fell roughly 1%.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday sharply probed\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as higher duties are set to snap into place Friday for countries that have not yet reached trade deals with the administration.",
      "The 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. A ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "As arguments got underway, several judges on the appeals court peppered Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, about whether IEEPA authorizes the president to impose tariffs.",
      "One judge immediately noted that the law has never before been used to assess the levies on trading partners.",
      "Many other laws regulating trade include the word \"tariff,\" the judge said, \"but here, IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them.\"",
      "Pointing to those trade statutes, which impose constraints on the duties that a president can assess, one of the judges questioned why a president would rely on those laws when IEEPA provides broader power under the Justice Department's interpretation.",
      "\"Your argument dislocates that entire U.S. trade-relief framework,\" he said.",
      "Later, looking at the harmonized tariff schedule, which sets tariff rates and categories for merchandise imported into the U.S., members of the court criticized the scope of Mr. Trump's levies, which cover nearly every country.",
      "\"It's a wholesale revision of the scheme that Congress enacted,\" a judge said, adding, \"it's really kind of asking for an extraordinary change\" to the legislature's approach to the tariff schedule.",
      "Other members of the Federal Circuit seemed concerned with the breadth of authority the president was claiming in relying on IEEPA to impose broad tariffs on trading partners.",
      "\"It seems to me you're asking for unbounded authority,\" one judge told Shumate.",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday for countries the administration has not reached trade agreements with.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy. Shumate argued before the Federal Circuit that courts should not second-guess the president's determination that trade deficits are an emergency, and some of the judges seemed inclined to agree that the consequences of those imbalances would fit within IEEPA's framework.",
      "He also said that the emergency powers law authorizes a president to \"regulate ... any ... importation,\" and that covers the imposition of tariffs.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"That is a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,\" Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the small businesses, told the Federal Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",

      "Your glass of French or Italian wine could get pricier as soon as next week, with a new 15% U.S. tariff on European Union imports set to kick in on Aug. 1. The same goes for popular brands of whisky, cognac and other spirits, many of which are made in Europe.",
      "Harry Root, owner of Grassroots Wine, in Charleston, South Carolina, which distributes domestic and imported wines to restaurants and retailers, said the new levies on goods from the 27-country EU will leave him no choice but to raise prices for his clients, which he said are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers.",
      "\"We have to increase prices because when the container of wine I've ordered lands, I have to pay 100% of whatever the tariff is on that wine,\" Root said on Wednesday at a U.S. Wine Trade Alliance (USWTA) roundtable on the impact of the new U.S. tariffs on the EU.",
      "Higher prices for imported wines will also raise the cost of wine produced in the U.S. as consumers shift to domestic labels and drive up demand, according to USWTA President Ben Aneff.",
      "\"Econ 101 will tell you that higher-cost imported products will also mean higher prices for domestic products,\" Aneff said at the roundtable. \"So you'd expect a big drop in demand, higher prices, lower choice for consumers. It's a problem.\"",
      "Max Rohn, CEO of Long Island, New York-based Wolffer Estate winery, put it bluntly.",
      "\"We want people to drink wine, and tariffs will make them drink less wine,\" he said during the USWTA event.",
      "A trade group representing Italian winemakers, Unioni Vini Italiani, is warning that a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. could cost around $15 after the 15% EU tariff kicks in.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment about concerns that higher tariffs on EU and other imports could raise the cost of wine and spirits in the U.S.",
      "Higher costs for a wee dram",
      "A 10% American\u00a0levy on the U.K. under a trade deal announced in May could also push up liquor costs for U.S. consumers. Drew McKenzie Smith, founder and managing director of Fife, Scotland-based Lindores Abbey Distillery, told CBS MoneyWatch that the tariff on shipments to the U.S. could force him to hike the price of a bottle of scotch by an equivalent amount.",
      "\"We had hoped to shoulder that cost because if you put your whisky up too much, then people won't buy it. But to cover that, it means we'd have to add 10% to the price of a bottle, so it's a tricky one,\" he said, noting that a bottle of Abbey Distillery scotch that currently retails for about $86 could rise to about $94.",
      "In 2024, the U.K. exported 132 million bottles of scotch whisky to the U.S., according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research firm that is tracking the effects of tariffs on food and beverage costs in the U.S, said that the wine and spirits business is more exposed to tariffs because consumers are less likely to switch to domestic substitutes.",
      "\"It's a little different when you're assessing the impact on prices related to wine and spirits compared to other goods because consumers have certain tastes and preferences,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Meanwhile, unlike with some industries, which may be able to relocate factories from abroad to the U.S., wine production can't be reshored.",
      "\"You can't produce French wine in the U.S. because then it ceases to be French wine,\" he said. \"If consumers have a strong preference for a particular bottle, they'll continue to buy it.\"",
      "Added Aneff of the USWTA, \"Wines from one place are not fungible for wines from another. It's a different product.\"",
      "Lobbying for relief",
      "Trade groups for both European and domestic wine producers are lobbying for exemptions from the 15% tariffs on most EU goods, citing the potential for substantial losses on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Unione Italiana Vini said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that the 15% tariff would result in a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the finalized deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "The USWTA is also urging U.S. trade officials to include wine in its list of exempted goods under the new U.S.-EU trade deal.",
      "\"We are heartened that negotiations are leaving room for wine to be included under the zero-for-zero exemption structure,\" Aneff said in a statement. \"Now is the time to ensure wine is prioritized in the final agreement.\"",
      "Addressing the EU tariff agreement, Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO Chris Swonger\u00a0said\u00a0the group is also \"optimistic that in the days ahead this positive meeting and agreement will lead to a return to zero-for-zero tariffs for U.S. and EU spirits products.\"",
      "Peril for restaurants",
      "The stepped up U.S. tariffs on the EU wouldn't just hurt consumers \u2014 they could also lead to the loss of thousands of jobs at manufacturers and distributors, according to industry experts. Restaurants, which depend on sales of European wines to buoy them financially, also could feel the impact in the form of slimmer profits.",
      "Typically, if a restaurant pays $15 for a bottle of wine from France or Italy, the two largest exporters to the U.S., it will charge patrons $15 a glass, Aneff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Their margin is five times the cost of the bottle,\" he said. \"And for a restaurant that's not a luxury \u2014 it's an absolute necessity.\"",
      "Such profits ensure that restaurants can stay in business and preserve jobs.",
      "EU imports \"are vital for the 47,500 wine retailers, 6,000 importers and distributors, and hundreds of thousands of restaurants around the country,\" Aneff said. \"In a nutshell, wine from the European Union brings an incredible economic surplus to businesses in the U.S. No other product allows us to capture such a huge percentage of the revenue generated here in the U.S.\"",

      "Mr. Trump had said earlier this month that the 30% import duties would begin on Friday for Mexican imports, saying at the time that the country had not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground.\"",
      "In his Thursday social media post, the president said he agreed to a 90-day extension during a phone conversation with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, which he described as \"very successsful.\"",
      "The president has turned to tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he says are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline to strike new trade deals with Mexico and many other nations, the Trump administration has announced trade deals with\u00a0five Asian countries, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union.",

      "Many economists project that tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices because the import duties are paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, which then pass on some or all of the costs to shoppers. While inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively muted, there are signs that the import duties are pushing some U.S. prices higher.",

      "Most countries, including South Korea, have faced 10% tariffs since April, when Mr. Trump delayed a set of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days to buy his administration time to negotiate. Then this month, the president sent letters to South Korea and around two dozen other trading partners telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Friday, Aug. 1, unless deals are reached.",

      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing.

      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid.

      "Economists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its two-day meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to FactSet. The FOMC, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",

      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "When it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release its monthly jobs report on Friday, offering a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

      "Meta defines superintelligence as AI that teaches itself and that surpasses human cognition, potentially helping people solve complex problems. Meanwhile, a personalized AI companion could remember a user's wedding anniversary, help plan a celebration or even assist in dealing with personal issues, according to the technology company.",

      "Zuckerberg's vision of the future also involves something else: glasses. Meta has teamed up with Ray Ban and other eyewear makers to develop AI glasses that let wearers make phone calls, take photos and handle other tasks.",
      "\"I think personal devices like glasses that can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our main computing devices,\" he said in a social media\u00a0video on X discussing the new initiative.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending what's known as a de minimis exemption allowing low-value parcels that are shipped to the United States to avoid tariffs.",
      "The White House said it's closing what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S. The order goes into effect Aug. 29.",
      "The exemption had applied to parcels valued at $800 or less, and allowed overseas retailers to ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "\"President Trump is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "Mr. Trump in May ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong, which had allowed retailers like Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S. according to the White House.",
      "The de minimis provision, which was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after that law's passage, was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has surged over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to nearly 1.4 billion.

    "story": [
      "More high-income Americans around the U.S. are falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans, a sign that even people earning more than six figures are more likely to struggle financially amid shifts in the economy.",
      "Delinquencies across all loan products for households earning more than $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023. That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",
      "High-income households had weathered the post-pandemic years better than lower-earning Americans because they had more of a cushion to absorb soaring inflation and other shocks, according to VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo.",
      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about six in 10 middle-income consumers saying they're financially stressed, according to a recent survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "More than one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Although Mr. Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, economists think the central bank is very likely to stand pat when officials announce their latest policy move on Wednesday.",

      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

      "Although U.S. exports to India rose in 2024, its trade deficit also rose by 5.4%, to $45.7 billion. The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at today's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool will be able to assess a person's age based on the types of videos they've watched, the categories of the videos, and how long the person has had their account \u2014 regardless of the birthday associated with it, James Beser, director of product management at YouTube,\u00a0said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the platform's blog.",
      "If the technology identifies a person as under 18, it will take extra steps to regulate their content by disabling personalized advertising and limiting repetitive views of certain kinds of content, among other things. If YouTube incorrectly determines someone's age, the user can upload a form of identification to fix the error.",
      "\"We will only allow users who have been inferred or verified as over 18 to view age-restricted content that may be inappropriate for younger users,\" YouTube said in the blog post.",
      "Google, which is the parent company of YouTube, did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "According to a recent Pew\u00a0survey, YouTube is the most popular social media app among teens. Ninety percent of teens ages 13 to 17 said they used YouTube last year, compared with 63% who said they used TikTok.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",
      "The July data appears to back up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's\u00a0most recent \"beige book,\" which compiles comments from local businesses, that many companies were delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant job report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "A panel of federal judges on Friday limited President Trump's effort to close the U.S. asylum system at the southern border, saying his administration can't unilaterally suspend laws that bar the U.S. from deporting migrants to places where they would face persecution or torture.",
      "The ruling centers on a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump just hours after he returned to the White House in January, ordering the closure of the asylum system. U.S. border officials have relied on the order to summarily expel those entering the country illegally, without allowing them to request asylum. Mr. Trump justified the sweeping measure on the grounds that the country is facing an \"invasion\" of migrants.",
      "The three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit lifted its administrative pause on a July ruling from a federal judge who found Mr. Trump's proclamation defied U.S. laws that require the federal government to hear the claims of migrants who want to apply for humanitarian protection out of fear that they could be harmed if deported.",
      "That ruling by U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss struck down the Trump administration's asylum ban and would've required officials to stop enforcing it on a legal class comprised of migrants who are or will be in the U.S.",
      "While it lifted its stay on Moss' ruling, the D.C. Circuit panel also narrowed his order, limiting the class members eligible for relief to asylum-seekers already on American soil while Mr. Trump's decree is in effect. The appellate court also limited the scope of Moss' ruling, partially granting a request from the Trump administration.",
      "The panel allowed the Trump administration to continue using the president's proclamation to deny migrants access to the U.S. asylum system, noting that U.S. law permits, but does not require, the government to grant asylum to those who prove they could be persecuted because of their race, religion, politics or other factors.",
      "But the panel also said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to prevent migrants from applying for other forms of humanitarian protections that the U.S. is legally required to give to certain migrants fleeing persecution and torture. They're known as \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Those protections have a higher legal threshold than asylum, but unlike asylum, they are mandatory, not discretionary, and must be granted to those who meet the requirements.",
      "The panel was made up of Circuit Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, who were appointed by former President Barack Obama, as well as Gregory G. Katsas, an appointee of Mr. Trump. Each judge filed their own statements in the case, with Pillard and Katsas disagreeing with some aspects of the ruling.",
      "While they had some disagreements, all three judges said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to ignore laws around \"withholding of removal\" or Convention Against Torture protections. Pillard said she would've also blocked the administration from denying migrants the right to apply for asylum.",
      "The judges scheduled expedited proceedings to decide the merits of the case, asking both the government and the advocates challenging Mr. Trump's proclamation to file briefs through Sept. 26.",
      "The lawsuit that triggered Friday's decision was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates, who have denounced the Trump administration's border crackdown as a draconian policy that has sent migrants to harm's way.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Friday's order.",
      "Trump administration officials have credited the president's proclamation and other actions \u2014 including the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the southern border \u2014 for a historic drop in illegal crossings there.",
      "In July, just 4,600 migrants were caught crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest monthly tally recorded by Border Patrol and a figure the Biden administration reported daily during many months. While public monthly reports started in fiscal year 2000, annual data suggest the last time Border Patrol had that level of apprehensions was in the 1960s.",

      "The immigration raids at the center of the legal battle triggered massive protests in the Los Angeles area in June, as well as widespread fears among the region's large Latino community. While most demonstrations were peaceful, instances of violence led President Trump to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles with orders to protect federal buildings and the immigration agents enforcing his far-reaching crackdown on illegal immigration.

      "The 9th Circuit did alter one part of Frimpong's ruling, removing an exception to her ban on using the four factors that include people's race and vocation when making arrests. The panel said that an \"except as permitted by law\" clause in her order was too vague.",

      "In a Friday night scheduling order, the high court asked parties to file briefs on whether Louisiana's creation of a second majority-minority House seat violates the 14th or 15th Amendments. The question could significantly curtail efforts to force states to create majority-minority congressional districts.",
      "The order is part of a case from the 2024 term regarding\u00a0Louisiana's congressional map\u00a0that justices decided to hold over for re-argument. The justices set a deadline of Aug. 27 for briefs to be filed by appellants on the question. Reply briefs are due Oct. 3, the Friday before the beginning of the 2025 session.",
      "In June, the Supreme Court ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that was approved by the state's GOP-led legislature and created a second majority-Black district.",
      "An order from the court issued on the last day of the 2024 term restored the case to its calendar for reargument. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the move to order more arguments and said the court should have decided the case.",
      "The move meant the state's map with two majority-Black districts would remain intact for now.",
      "The district lines at the center of the dispute were invalidated in 2022 by a three-judge lower court panel, which sided with a group of self-described \"non-African-American voters\" who had challenged the House map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The map wasn't the first crafted by the state's Republican-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census. Instead, Louisiana's efforts to redraw district lines, as all states do after the census, have resulted in a yearslong legal battle that has been before the Supreme Court twice before.",
      "The case demonstrated the challenges state lawmakers face when trying to balance trying to comply with the Voting Rights Act without relying too much on race in the drawing the political lines, which can run afoul of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.

    "summary": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" that environmental policy can't \"strangulate out of existence\" energy policy.",
    "story": [
      "When the Environmental Protection Agency announced\u00a0it would roll back regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 especially from motor vehicles \u2014 it touted annual savings for Americans of $54 billion. The EPA said eliminating Biden-era policies, which encouraged higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and electric vehicle adoption to limit tailpipe emissions, would enable consumers to \"have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car.\"",
      "But a CBS News review of the agency's own regulatory impact analysis of the proposal found that gasoline prices would increase, and nearly a half million jobs would be lost by 2035, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency, which was cited in the EPA's report.",
      "Cost of gasoline",
      "In the EPA's July analysis, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which collects and analyzes energy data, showed Biden-era policies that were adopted by the end of 2024 would dramatically bring down the future cost of gasoline because more consumers would be driving electric vehicles, hybrids and fuel-efficient cars that require less gas.",
      "It is challenging to predict the future gas prices because they're subject to high uncertainty and market volatility, but under a future scenario where Biden-era policies have been revoked under the Trump administration, the EIA projects gasoline prices will continue to increase because of a higher demand for gas-powered cars and fuel.",
      "The former administrator of the EIA, Joseph DeCarolis, explained in an email that if the government \"disincentivizes electric vehicle purchases, more consumers will purchase gasoline vehicles resulting in higher gasoline consumption and high gasoline prices for everyone.\"",
      "\"There's a clear causal connection between rescinding measures promoting electric vehicles, such as EPA tailpipe standards, and the projection of higher gasoline prices,\" he said.",
      "When asked in an interview with CBS News' \"The Takeout with Major Garrett\" about how this plan could raise gas prices, Zeldin did not directly address the question.",
      "Instead, he argued that previous policies like an electric vehicle mandate were costing trillions of dollars to regulate climate pollution, saying the policies were \"seeking to strangulate out of existence, entire sectors of our economy, and specifically our energy economy.",
      "'It's important that we are applying common sense,\" Zeldin said, \"that we are cognizant of these economic demands and that, wherever possible, when we can protect the environment and grow the economy that we will choose both.\"",
      "Neither the Biden nor Obama administrations implemented EV mandates, though both encouraged EV adoptions by Americans and businesses.",
      "Zeldin reiterated the Trump administration's stance that the EPA does not have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act unless an act of Congress changes that.",
      "\"Here's my message: If Congress wants the EPA to be regulating the heck out of carbon dioxide, well, they could put it inside of law,\" Zeldin said.",
      "Impacts on fuel efficiency",
      "Along with rolling back greenhouse gas emissions standards to limit tailpipe emissions, the EPA would also rescind fuel efficiency measures.",
      "Under Biden-era fuel efficiency policies, a new standard gas-powered car was expected to get 47.1 miles per gallon by 2027, and by 2035, cars were expected to achieve 61.2 mpg, according to EIA data.",
      "Without the Biden policies, model 2027 cars are supposed to meet a 43.6 mpg standard and gradually increase to 50.5 mpg by 2035.",
      "Light trucks and SUVs, beginning in model year 2027, under a scenario where Biden policies are revoked by the Trump administration, are set to reach fuel efficiency of 27.2 mpg and increase to 28.6 mpg by 2035. Had the Biden policies remained in place, SUVs and light trucks were expected to meet a 28.4 mpg standard in 2027 and increase to 46.2 mpg by 2035, according to EIA data.",
      "Future job losses",
      "The EIA's own data estimates that a future scenario \u2014 where Biden-Obama emissions standards are revoked \u2014 would lead to a loss of 450,000 jobs by 2035. Jobs would begin to rebound by 2045, but not enough to overcome the significant losses suffered in previous decades.",
      "Peter Huether, senior transportation research associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a statement, \"Drivers would pay thousands of dollars more in fuel and maintenance costs over the life of a vehicle, and businesses could lose billions annually from higher trucking costs\" as a result of the Trump administration's deregulation.",

      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",

He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Over the course of three days of investigative hearings, the National Transportation and Safety Board sought to gather more information about the factors that lead to the deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., in January between an Army helicopter and a passenger plane.",
      "The NTSB heard testimony from air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army, and the families of several of the victims were in attendance. At one point on the first day of the hearings, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said of the circumstances leading up to the crash, \"Every sign was there that there was a safety risk.\" Addressing the families, she said the hearings would be \"a critical part of our ongoing investigation.\"",
      "On Jan. 29, a Black Hawk helicopter struck an American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, as it was coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.",
      "The NTSB will continue its fact finding and will compile a final report with determinations about the probable cause, likely within the next year.",
      "Here are the top takeaways from the hearings:",
      "Helicopter's altitude measurements showed significant discrepancies",
      "The Black Hawk crew members were relying on a barometric altimeter \u2014 a gauge that determines altitude based on air pressure \u2014 which may have given them incorrect information, according to NTSB investigators. The crew was calling out altitudes that were lower than the actual height at which the helicopter was flying.",
      "The helicopter and commercial airliner collided approximately 300 feet above the Potomac River, and the maximum altitude for helicopters at that part of the route near D.C.'s Reagan Airport is 200 feet.",
      "The NTSB, as part of its investigation, tested three helicopters that are in the same battalion as the one that crashed and found that the barometric altimeter for all three was off by 80 to 130 feet. Army representatives on Wednesday told investigators that discrepancy is within the accepted variability because pilots are trained to maintain their altitude at plus or minus 100 feet.",
      "NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told CBS News' senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave the NTSB calculated the margin of error on Route Four in that area of the Potomac to be 75 feet.",
      "The Army said it is conducting additional reviews to determine how to proceed, frustrating investigators who asked why it would not make changes to the equipment, based on the findings of the NTSB tests.",
      "In 2022, an FAA working group considered moving helicopter traffic away from the airport, but ultimately did not.",
      "Airplane pilots knew they were going to be hit",
      "Transcripts from the airplane's cockpit voice recorder show the pilots received an automated verbal warning about traffic in the vicinity approximately 20 seconds before the collision. Less than two seconds before impact, the pilots shouted in alarm. Flight data indicates the plane's pilots attempted to climb to avoid the helicopter just before impact.",
      "The transcripts also reveal the pilots of the American Airlines flight questioned the move to Runway 33. The plane was originally supposed to land on Runway 1 but was redirected by air traffic controllers to Runway 33. As it was trying to land on that runway, the helicopter and plane collided.",
      "Black Hawk pilots missed key command from air traffic controller",
      "The pilots of the Black Hawk missed a key word when communicating with the air traffic control tower, according to a transcript released during the hearings of the conversation between the helicopter crew and the control tower.",
      "Fifteen seconds before the collision, DCA Tower asked the helicopter if it had the regional jet in sight. Four seconds later, the DCA Tower instructed the helicopter to pass behind the plane. The Black Hawk's cockpit voice recorder indicated that the phrase \"pass behind\" was rendered inaudible because a helicopter crew member pressed the microphone key.",
      "FAA acknowledged air traffic controller did not warn airliner that the helicopter might cross its path",
      "Although it was already known \u2014 based on control tower audio from that night \u2014 that the controller did not warn the American Airlines plane that the Black Hawk might cross its path, the FAA only openly acknowledged this for the first time during this week's hearings.",
      "In a key moment from the second day, Homendy asked FAA Air Traffic Oversight Service executive director Nick Fuller if any traffic advisories or alerts were issued to the plane. He responded, \"No safety alerts.\"",
      "Homendy then asked, \"Should the local controller have let the [plane] crew know that there was a helicopter there?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Fuller responded.",
      "Medivac pilot said presence of military helicopters in National Airport airspace makes him \"uncomfortable\"",
      "Rick Dressler, of Metro Aviation \u2013 which operates medical helicopters \u2014 was asked if there are units flying in the National Airport airspace that make him uncomfortable.",

      "In a letter to Maxwell obtained by CBS News, Comer said the committee is \"willing to delay\" the Aug. 11 deposition date while the Supreme Court weighs taking up her case.",
      "Maxwell \u2014 who is serving a 20-year prison sentence \u2014 is challenging her conviction, arguing she should've been covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors in Florida offered to Epstein and any co-conspirators almost two decades ago. The Supreme Court indicated this week it will consider whether to hear Maxwell's case in September, and Comer said her deposition can take place after the court decides on whether to take the case.",
      "Comer also said the committee will \"engage in good faith negotiations\" around the deposition, but is \"unwilling to grant you congressional immunity\" and will not send her its questions in advance \u2014 rejecting two requests by Maxwell's attorney.",
      "Her lawyer, David Oscar Markus, told the committee earlier this week she will plead the Fifth at her deposition unless she's granted immunity or President Trump pardons her, arguing that any testimony to Congress could endanger her appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The oversight panel said in a statement this week it would not consider giving Maxwell immunity.",

      "The administration responded last month by asking judges to unseal grand jury transcripts from Maxwell's and Epstein's criminal cases.

      "Immigrants from Nepal enrolled in the TPS program were set to lose their legal status next week, on Aug. 5. TPS holders from Honduras and Nicaragua, meanwhile, were slated to see their work permits and deportation protections under the program expire in early September.",
      "U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ordered the planned TPS terminations for these countries to be postponed through at least Nov. 18, when she scheduled a hearing on the merits of a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision. Thompson said the delay could be extended beyond Nov. 18.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the Department of Homeland Security to offer a temporary safe haven \u2014 in the form of deportation deferrals and work authorization \u2014 to immigrants from countries beset by armed conflict, an environmental disaster or other crises.",
      "Those enrolled in TPS are generally immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally or who arrived legally on temporary visas and then applied for the humanitarian program.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to severely curtail TPS programs, arguing that some of them are contrary to U.S. national interests and that they've been in place for too long, despite their temporary nature and improved conditions in the relevant countries.",
      "The administration, for example, has noted that the TPS programs for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in 1999, after Hurricane Mitch caused catastrophic floods and killed thousands in Central America. The TPS program for Nepal was announced in 2015, after an earthquake hit the small Asian country. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said all three countries have recovered from those environmental disasters.",
      "But Thompson, the San Francisco-based federal judge, said the TPS holders who sued the Trump administration were likely to succeed in their arguments that Noem's decisions were \"preordained\" actions that did not fully consider lingering conditions in Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "Thompson, who was appointed by former President Biden, also found the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in arguing that Noem's decisions were \"motivated by racial animus.\" Thompson cited statements by Noem that she said stereotyped the TPS program and associated immigrants with criminality.",
      "The judge also referenced a comment made by President Trump during the 2024 campaign in which he said migrants entering the U.S. illegally were \"poisoning the blood of our country.\"",
      "\"The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees,\" Thompson wrote in her order.",
      "DHS castigated the ruling in a statement Friday, calling it \"disgusting\" and saying it \"sounds like a New York Times opinion piece.\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused the judge of \"race-baiting\" and said the administration will appeal.",
      "According to official government statistics, there are 72,000 Hondurans, 12,700 Nepalis and 4,000 Nicaraguans enrolled in the TPS policy. Some of them, however, have been able to gain green cards, or lawful permanent U.S. residency, including 21,000 of the Honduran TPS holders. An estimated 5,500 and 1,100 TPS holders from Nepal and Nicaragua, respectively, have also become permanent residents, according to government data.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, his administration has announced plans to terminate TPS for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including Afghans, Cameroonians, Haitians and Venezuelans.",
      "Federal courts have blocked some of those terminations, but the Supreme Court allowed the administration to revoke the TPS protections of more than 300,000 Venezuelans.",

      "Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence after she was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit and abuse underage girls. An appeal of her conviction is currently awaiting action by the Supreme Court, which is set to discuss whether to take up her case at its closed-door conference in late September.",
      "Maxwell had been held at the federal correctional institute in Tallahassee, a low-security facility with a population of nearly 1,200 inmates. The federal prison camp in Bryan, where she's been moved, is considered minimum security and houses 635 inmates, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",
      "The move was condemned in a statement by several of Epstein and Maxwell's accusers, including the family of Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "\"It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas. This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes,\" they said in a statement.",
      "\"The American public should be enraged by the preferential treatment being given to a pedophile and a criminally charged child sex offender.

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from rapidly deporting migrants who entered the U.S. legally on humanitarian grounds, potentially curtailing arrests at immigration courts that have triggered controversy across the country.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb of Washington, D.C., barred federal immigration officials from using two Trump administration directives to apply a fast-track deportation process known as expedited removal on migrants who were granted immigration parole to enter the U.S. at an official port of entry. Parole is an immigration authority that allows federal officials to admit foreigners on humanitarian grounds, and lets them live and work in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis.",
      "If left in place, Cobb's ruling could significantly hinder the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to ramp up its mass deportation campaign by targeting migrants allowed into the U.S. under the Biden administration through the parole authority. The Justice Department is expected to appeal her order.",
      "One operation in particular that could be curtailed by Cobb's ruling is a Trump administration effort to convince immigration judges to dismiss the court cases of certain migrants, so that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can arrest them after their hearings and place them in expedited removal.",
      "Unlike immigration court cases, which typically take years to complete due to a backlog of millions of unresolved claims, expedited removal allows officials to more quickly deport migrants who arrived to the U.S. in the past two years. Those placed in that process face summary deportation from the U.S. unless they express concerns of being persecuted in their home countries and prove to an asylum officer that their fear is credible.",
      "The courthouse arrests have been reported in cities across the U.S., with videos emerging showing ICE officials detaining migrants immediately after their hearings conclude. In some cases, those taken into custody have been seen weeping and visibly distraught. The practice has been strongly decried by Democratic lawmakers and advocates, who say it punishes people who are trying to follow the legal process by showing up to their hearings.",
      "In her opinion, Cobb found the Trump administration's efforts to be illegal, saying the lawsuit against the expedited deportations raised a \"question of fair play.\" She noted the plaintiffs in the case, two migrants from Cuba and Venezuela, had \"played by the rules,\" entered the country with the government's permission and attended their court hearings \u2014 and were nonetheless targeted for expedited deportation.",
      "\"This case's underlying question, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,\" Cobb wrote. \"Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that \u2014 as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers \u2014 may look to them more and more like the countries from which they tried to escape?\"",
      "Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert in U.S. immigration law, said Cobb's order could mean that \"several hundred thousand people will be temporarily spared from immediate removal under the expedited removal procedures.\"",
      "Yale-Loehr noted the ruling is a reprieve for many of the more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who were allowed into the U.S. through the parole authority, under a Biden administration sponsorship policy. It also protects some of the nearly 1 million migrants paroled into the U.S. along the southern border under another Biden-era policy powered by a now-discontinued phone app known as CBP One.",
      "In a statement, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin denounced Friday's order.",

In June, the House\u00a0approved a White House request\u00a0to claw back $1.1 billion in already appointed federal funds from the CPB. The Senate Appropriations Committee's 2026 appropriations bill eliminated funding for the CPB for the first time in over 50 years.",
      "\"Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,\" said CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison in a statement. \"CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.\"",

      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News on July 17. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",

      "Washington \u2014 On the campaign trail, Donald Trump made a pledge: Under his leadership, in vitro fertilization would be covered for all women and couples seeking the treatment. \"We are going to be paying for that treatment,\" he said in an interview in August 2024.",
      "After taking office, President Trump signed an executive order directing his domestic policy council to make recommendations on IVF policy changes by May. But that deadline has come and gone, and the White House has said little about the issue. Advocates for better IVF coverage are wondering what the holdup is.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has called himself the \"father of IVF\" and claimed to be a \"leader on fertilization, IVF,\" told NBC News, during that 2024 interview, that IVF would be covered for everyone who needs it.",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,\" Mr. Trump, then a candidate, said. He added, \"We're going to be paying for that treatment, or we're gonna be mandating that the insurance company pay.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order, signed in February, fell short of his campaign pledge, stating that it would be administration policy \"to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.\"",
      "He directed his assistant for the White House Domestic Policy Council to submit within 90 days \"recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.\"",
      "That deadline would have fallen on May 19. Asked for an update, the White House declined to comment.",
      "Cristina Gonzales and her partner, who live in New York City, have been struggling with infertility for about three years. Gonzales, who makes campaign ads for Democrats, is a part of a support group for women over 40 going through IVF. The women represent diverse political and ideological backgrounds, including liberals and those who support Mr. Trump, alike. When then-candidate Trump said IVF would be covered, Gonzales said some in her group \"believed completely and wholeheartedly\" that he would make coverage free.",
      "\"They deserve that promise to be kept,\" Gonzales said.",
      "\"This struggle of IVF is nonpartisan,\" she said. \"It affects everybody.\"",
      "In February, a Washington Post interview with Trump supporter and fired federal worker Ryleigh Cooper went viral. She said she didn't want to vote for Mr. Trump, but he'd promised to make IVF free. After reading the fact sheet from Mr. Trump's February executive order, she told the Post she said, \"'That's bullsh**.'\"",
      "IVF is a fertility treatment that has broad support; in 2023, over 95,000 babies were born as a result of IVF \u2014 about 2.6% of all births in the U.S. \u2014 according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.",
      "An overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 86% \u2014 think IVF should be legal, according to a March 2024 CBS News/YouGov poll.",
      "\"Eighty-six percent of Americans support IVF. That is unheard of in almost any issue you could think of in modern times,\" said Danielle Melfi, CEO of infertility advocacy nonprofit RESOLVE.",
      "According to an April 2024 Pew survey, 79% of Democrats and those who lean Democratic say access to IVF is a good thing, as do 63% of Republicans and those who lean Republican. Even among Americans who told Pew abortion should be illegal in most cases, 60% view IVF access positively.",
      "And Mr. Trump has introduced other concepts, including a \"baby bonus\" for babies born in the U.S., to help boost the U.S. birth rate. The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024, with fewer than 1.6 children being born per woman, according to new federal data. The bonus is available to parents who open so-called Trump Accounts, which were introduced in the president's massive domestic policy bill that he signed into law last month.",
      "Melfi is optimistic about the momentum the issue has picked up and has made recommendations to the White House, among them, to increase health insurance coverage of all fertility-related treatment, include fertility coverage for veterans and military families, and cover fertility care for all federal employees.",
      "Out-of-pocket costs are the biggest barrier to undergoing IVF, Melfi said. Each cycle \u2014 and many couples undergo several cycles \u2014 costs between $12,000 and $25,000. Very few states require insurance companies to provide coverage for the treatment, so the vast majority of women and couples must pay out of pocket for IVF rounds.",
      "\"Each state looks a little bit different, which is why action at the federal level would be really meaningful,\" Melfi said of state laws governing insurance coverage of IVF.",
      "IVF is one of multiple infertility treatments available, and is often the last \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 step women take to become pregnant.",
      "In the process, a woman typically administers expensive shots to herself every day to stimulate the growth of multiple eggs at once and regularly goes to a fertility clinic for ultrasounds and blood work to monitor progress. The eggs are retrieved, fertilized outside of the body and ideally, they develop into healthy embryos that can be implanted immediately or frozen for later use.",
      "Many find it to be an exhausting process \u2014 physically, emotionally and financially.",
      "Leading up to her first round of IVF, Gonzales was anxious. What if she and her partner were to spend all this money only for the procedure to not result in pregnancy?",
      "\"I don't have enough money for this and I feel like there's a lot of pressure on my body \u2014 what if it doesn't perform?\" she said.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday the new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately.",
      "Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, as well.",
      "In announcing the hike in Canadian tariffs, White House said Canada hadn't done enough to \"arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\"",
      "In a statement released early Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\" he said.",
      "Carney added that some industries - including lumber, steel, aluminum and automobiles - are \"heavily impacted by U.S. duties and tariffs. For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversity our export markets.\"",
      "In Beijing, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Friday that, \"China's opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no one's interests.\"",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Global financial markets fell in overnight trading after the White House tariff announcement. In the U.S., stock futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex were each down 0.9%, while Nasdaq Composite futures fell roughly 1%.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 08:54:20 -0400",
    "summary": "A longtime Justice Department employee was fired in July because her husband operated ICEBlock, an app that tracks the locations of immigration agents.",
    "story": [
      "Carolyn Feinstein said she initially thought the message sent to her private email address on a late Friday afternoon was a scheme or a prank. It turned out that she was being fired from her federal job. Once Feinstein read the email, she discovered her work cellphone was no longer operating.",
      "Feinstein's decade of work as a forensic auditor for the Justice Department's Office of Trustee \u2014 which helps oversee bankruptcies \u2014 ended on July 18, when her employment was terminated in a three-paragraph message sent by an agency administrator.",
      "\"This is a big loss to me,\" Feinstein told CBS News. \"I have dedicated my career to the mission of the U.S. Trustee program. I believe strongly in that mission. I would get up every day knowing that my actions professionally were helping. They were adding to the greater good.\"",
      "Feinstein joins dozens of other Justice Department employees who have been ousted this year. Her firing was conducted in a similar fashion to other Justice Department terminations, via an email from the agency that cited the administration's \"Article II\" power to fire employees.",
      "\"I felt like I was just kind of left in the dark, because that termination letter really didn't explain anything to me,\" Feinstein said.",
      "But Feinstein's background and her case are different from the others.",
      "Feinstein's husband, who operates a private business, developed a controversial phone app that helped users track the location of federal immigration agents. The ICEBlock app, which carries the moniker, \"see something; tap something\", bills itself as an \"innovative, completely anonymous crowdsourced platform that allows users to report Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity with just two taps on their phone.\"",
      "ICEBlock \u2014 and similar apps that notify people about the presence of ICE agents \u2014 have grown in popularity this year, as the Trump administration aims to ramp up arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. Administration officials have lashed out at those responsible for these apps, alleging they impede the work of federal law enforcement.",
      "In the days after the ICEBlock app was publicized in reporting by CNN and later by Trump ally and social media figure Laura Loomer, Feinstein said she notified her employers about threats she and her husband had been receiving from critics.",
      "Feinstein said she was fired days after, with the Justice Department alleging the termination was \"based on your lack of candor during an internal inquiry.\"",
      "\"It's dehumanizing to the federal workforce, it's treating them like commodities,\" said Kel McClanahan, an attorney who is representing Feinstein.",
      "McClanahan told CBS News he views the recent wave of firings as a governmental version of a \"5-year-old's tantrums.\"",
      "Feinstein has a 20% ownership of the company that operates ICEBlock, which her husband runs, according to McClanahan. The lawyer told CBS News that Feinstein held an ownership stake to allow her to wind down the company if her husband were to face an emergency or die. The app is free, and Feinstein's husband told CNN he doesn't plan to monetize it.",
      "McClanahan said Feinstein had reported her connection to the business behind the app on annual disclosure forms.",
      "The Justice Department cited the app and Feinstein's connection to the company in a statement defending her firing.",
      "\"For several weeks, the Department of Justice inquired into this former employee's activities and discovered she has a sizable interest in All U Chart, Inc., the company that holds the IP for ICEBlock,\" a Justice Department spokeswoman told CBS News. \"ICEBlock is an app that illegal aliens use to evade capture while endangering the lives of ICE officers by disclosing their location. This DOJ will not tolerate threats against law enforcement or law enforcement officers.\"",
      "Feinstein is the latest of dozens of career Justice Department civil servants fired this year. In the hours after President Trump's second inauguration, his administration began conducting a purge of prosecutors, staff and office administrators who were involved in prosecuting people who took part in the Jan. 6 riot \u2014 a violent insurrection that Mr. Trump has sought to redefine \u2014 and the criminal investigations of Trump himself, which were shuttered in 2024 after his election.",
      "The firings have continued this summer, with several high-profile terminations of administrators and prosecutors, who have claimed their firings were forms of political retribution.",
      "Feinstein argued her firing will exacerbate a staffing shortage inside the agency's bankruptcy\u00a0 trustee audit program. She worked out of a Texas office for the U.S. Trustee Program.",
      "\"Those people are very competent and able to do their jobs, but they are only human. So when you take out someone as proficient as myself in such a vital role as auditor, it is really going to impact what that office can do for the program,\" she said.",
      "The Justice Department is facing unusually severe shortages of employees in other major offices, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News.",
      "In late spring, the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Columbia had 89 staffing openings, a capacity gap that two former prosecutors said could lead to staff being overworked and greater delays in processing cases. That office handled all of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, and saw multiple prosecutors fired early in 2025. The office's total workforce is nearly 700 people, including prosecutors and support staff.",
      "Federal employees, including Feinstein, have the right to challenge their terminations under the government's Merit Services Protection Board. But several fired employees have told CBS News the board is jammed with a wave of new cases and is less able to move swiftly on any new complaint.",
      "Feinstein said she loved job and misses the work.",
      "\"I'd go back in a heartbeat,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended how the Supreme Court is handling an unprecedented number of emergency appeals from the Trump administration, saying that as presidents push the limits of their power, courts will have to respond.",
      "Speaking before a group of lawyers and judges Thursday in Kansas City, Missouri, Kavanaugh said presidents in both parties, stymied by inaction in Congress, have relied more on executive orders \"to get things done.\" That's led to more legal challenges, Kavanaugh said, which inevitably draw in the Supreme Court to determine whether the new regulation can take effect, at least temporarily, while the legal challenges play out.",
      "So far, the court has been inclined to say yes, agreeing to allow a number of President Trump's high-profile executive orders to take effect while the lower courts review the merits, such as orders to fire members of independent federal agencies, freeze certain federal grants and plan layoffs at nearly every federal agency.",
      "Asked about criticism that the court isn't doing enough to explain its reasoning in some of those emergency cases, Kavanaugh said the court has written more than it has in the past. He said the court also had made some internal changes in the past five or six years \"to try to get the right answer,\" including scheduling emergency oral arguments, as in the recent case challenging nationwide injunctions.",
      "He said he was a \"fan of more process\" and mentioned two recent cases, including the president's removal power in independent agencies, where he unsuccessfully urged the court to step in and decide the underlying issue before it went through the lower courts.",
      "Kavanaugh's hour-long remarks came in a conversation with U.S. District Judge Sarah Pitlyk, one of his former law clerks, at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit's judicial conference. It's one of several judicial conferences this summer that will feature different justices.",
      "Last week, Justice Elena Kagan spoke to the California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where she urged the court to be more cautious with its handling of the so-called emergency docket. She also said that while she finds some of the court's recent decisions \"frustrating\" and \"sometimes even maddening,\" prompting fierce dissents, she believed her colleagues were \"all operating in good faith.\"",
      "Kavanaugh shared a similar sentiment about the other justices, saying even in disagreement, \"they're thoughtfully engaging in difficult issues,\" and he believed it was \"a sign of strength when there are different views expressed.\"",
      "\"The collegiality of the Supreme Court is very strong, strong to this day,\" he said. \"We all look out for each other. We think the other eight are patriots and are good people.\"",
      "His wide-ranging conversation with Pitlyk was at times personal and humorous, touching on everything from lessons he's taken from sports to some of his favorite opinions in recent terms. He said he's aware of criticism of the court, but that \"criticism is part of the job.\"",
      "Like the referees for high school sports, Kavanaugh said, as a justice, \"you have to recognize and know thick skin and criticism comes with the territory.\"",
      "\"Did you ever walk out of a game and say, 'our team lost, but the refs were great?'\" Kavanaugh said, to laughter from the audience. \"That informs my judging, too.\"",
      "Jan Crawford is CBS News' chief legal correspondent and a recognized authority on the Supreme Court. Her 2007 book, \"Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for the Control of the United States Supreme Court\" (Penguin Press), gained critical acclaim and became an instant New York Times Bestseller."

    "story": [
      "Most of the more than 109,000 arrests carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first five months of President Trump's second term took place in border and Southern states, according to a CBS News analysis of government data.",
      "States in the southern U.S., as well as those along the border with Mexico, saw the highest levels of ICE arrests between the start of Mr. Trump's second term on Jan. 20 and June 27, the figures show.",
      "That continued a trend that predates the current administration, though ICE arrests have increased sharply across the country since last year. During the same time period in 2024, under the Biden administration, ICE made over 49,000 arrests, meaning that arrests by the agency have increased by 120% under the Trump administration.",
      "The statistics indicate that Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during that time period. About 11% of ICE arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California, followed by 4% in Georgia and 3% in Arizona. ICE made the fewest arrests in Vermont, Alaska and Montana, about 100 total apprehensions combined.",
      "The locations of a small percentage of the arrests could not be discerned from the dataset, which was obtained by a group known as the Deportation Data Project through litigation.",
      "Overall, the individuals arrested by ICE between Jan. 20 and June 27 came from nearly 180 countries, but most were from Latin America or the Caribbean, according to the data.",
      "Mexico was the most common country of citizenship, with nearly 40,000 of those taken into ICE custody listed as Mexican citizens. Nationals of Guatemala and Honduras followed with around 15,000 and 12,000, respectively. Nearly 8,000 were citizens of Venezuela and over 5,000 of El Salvador.",
      "Immigration experts said the concentration of arrests in Southern and border states is not necessarily surprising and can largely be attributed to geography, demographics and the extent to which local law enforcement agencies cooperate with ICE.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, explained that ICE tends to focus its resources in areas where local policies permit law enforcement interaction with federal immigration authorities, such as Texas and Florida. Other places, like California, may also see high levels of ICE arrests because they have large communities of immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, even though state and local policies limit collaboration with ICE.",
      "\"It's easier for ICE to be picking people up from state and local jails where there's cooperation,\" Bush-Joseph said. In cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies, \"ICE has to spend more resources picking up people for at-large arrests,\" she added.",
      "Bush-Joseph also noted the countries of origin for those arrested by ICE align with broader immigration trends. \"Generally, we're talking about countries that are geographically close\" to the U.S., she said.",
      "Latin American and Caribbean immigrants accounted for 84% of all unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023, according to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "ICE is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, as well as other noncitizens who lose their legal status, including because of criminal activity. The agency has been given a sweeping mandate by Mr. Trump, tasked with carrying out his campaign promise of overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in American history.",
      "Under the Trump administration, ICE has reversed Biden-era limits on arrests in the interior of the country and allowed deportation agents to arrest a broader group of individuals, including those who are in the U.S. illegally but who lack a criminal record.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News recently that while his agents are still prioritizing the arrest of violent offenders who are in the U.S. illegally, anyone found to be in the country in violation of federal immigration law will be taken into custody.",
      "Halfway into Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, ICE recorded 150,000 deportations, putting the agency on track to carry out the most removals since the Obama administration, over a decade ago, CBS News reported.

    "story": [
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "Over the years, the U.S. has implemented heavy sanctions on Iranian industries, including trying to stop tankers used to transfer Iranian oil to China, which could help fund Iranian nuclear development programs. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department imposed additional sanctions, which Washington called the most extensive action of its kind since 2018.",
      "Recently, a CBS News crew set off from Singapore, one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, to head more than 80 nautical miles away in international waters to see how the \"dark fleet\" operates.",
      "\"As long as there's a supply, there will be a demand for this discounted oil,\" said Charlie Brown, a former U.S. Navy officer who's now a senior adviser with United Against Nuclear Iran, who is advising the U.S. government.",
      "The supply is Iran, the demand is China, and this mutually beneficial relationship, which has long angered the United States, plays out off the coast of Malaysia in the Riau archipelago, an area the size of New York City.",
      "\"This is 'dark fleet' parking central,\" said Brown, who's been monitoring the \"dark fleet\" for years.",
      "He described one ship, the Tifani, as \"a well-known 'dark fleet' tanker that's always been out here on a regular basis.\"",
      "The tankers, full of oil, sail from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Malacca to the Riau archipelago. There, they transfer the crude to ships bound for China, which buys 90% of Iran's oil.",
      "During the CBS News crew's journey, four ship-to-ship transfers were happening in plain sight.",
      "These \"dark fleet\" tankers \u2014 all with their transponders switched off \u2014   clearly do not want to be identified.",
      "\"Both ships have a net or something, a tarp, deployed over the stern, covering the name and identification number \u2014   it's obvious deceptive practice,\" Brown said.",
      "Further analysis revealed one ship was the elusive Stellar Oracle, laden with Iranian oil. It was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in May.",
      "Close by, another ship-to-ship transfer was underway involving the Alps \u2014   not its real name \u2014   filled with Iranian crude that was also sanctioned in May. The receiving vessel Eon, which is not on any list, was caught in the act \u2014   a new sanctions violator.",
      "According to a congressional report last year, this trade generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, propping up the regime and its nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on this trade this year, but it's having little effect. China doesn't recognize the unilateral U.S. sanctions on Iran and says that its trade with Iran is legitimate.",
      "By the end of the day, 12 ship-to-ship transfers were recorded in the Riau archipelago \u2014   an unprecedented number and a clear indication Iran and China are only ramping up this illicit activity.",

The approximately $200 million project will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.",

      "Asked about it by reporters later in the day, Mr. Trump said, \"We've been planning it for a long time.\" He said the new ballroom \"won't interfere with the current building,\" which he called his \"favorite place.\"",

      "It's unclear who the donors are as well as how the architects were chosen. The White House said McCrery Architects will be the lead architect, Clark Construction will oversee the construction and the engineering team will be led by AECOM.",
      "Construction is set to begin in September. The White House said Mr. Trump has held several meetings over the past few weeks with members of the White House staff, the National Park Service, the White House Military Office and the Secret Service to discuss design features and planning.",
      "\"The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it's theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical,\" the White House said in a release. \"The site of the new ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and has been renovated and changed many times, with a second story added in 1942.\"",

    "story": [
      "The family of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein's most well-known sex trafficking accusers, expressed shock after President Trump said Giuffre was one of the employees Epstein \"stole\" from the spa at the president's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "Giuffre, who had accused Britain's Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager trafficked by Epstein, has been a central figure in conspiracy theories tied to the case. She died by suicide this year.",
      "\"It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been 'stolen' from Mar-a-Lago,\" the family's statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump, responding to a reporter's question on Tuesday, said that he got upset with Epstein over his poaching of workers, including Giuffre, from his Palm Beach, Florida, club.",
      "The statement from Giuffre's family is the latest development involving Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges, and the Republican president, who was his one-time friend. Mr. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case.",
      "Mr. Trump's comment \"makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal actions,\" the family's statement said. Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida, is the one \"who targeted and preyed upon\" then 16-year-old Giuffre in 2000, the family said.",
      "\"We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,\" it continued.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted the president was responding to a reporter's question and didn't bring up Giuffre himself.",

      "Asked Thursday afternoon about Giuffre's family's statement, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't know\" why Epstein had taken staff.",
      "\"I said if he's taken anybody from Mar-A-Lago, he's hiring or whatever he's doing, I didn't like it. And we threw him out, we said we didn't want him at the place,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I didn't like it that he was doing that.\"",
      "The family's statement comes shortly after the Justice Department interviewed Maxwell. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche questioned Maxwell over two days in a Florida courthouse, though details about what she said haven't become public.",
      "Maxwell's lawyers have said she testified truthfully and answered questions \"about 100 different people.\" They have said she's willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony and if lawmakers agree to satisfy other conditions.",
      "A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family's statement was sent to Maxwell's attorney Thursday.",
      "A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell.",
      "Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates.",
      "Giuffre called Maxwell \"the mastermind\" behind the alleged sex trafficking in an interview with CBS News' Gayle King in 2020.",
      "\"She is a monster. She's worse than Epstein. She did things even worse than Epstein did. She was vicious. She was evil. And she's a woman,\" Giuffre said.",
      "Giuffre also told King that Maxwell could incriminate \"very well-known\" people.",
      "Giufree previously said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre's credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a \"substantial donation\" to her survivors' organization.",
      "The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein's prolonged downfall.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that its more closely watched Consumer Price Index, its primary inflation measure, also ticked higher in June as the cost of heavily imported items such as appliances, furniture and toys increased.",

      "Meet the potato's unexpected ancestor: the tomato.",
      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",
      "The research team analyzed 450 genomes from cultivated potatoes and 56 of the wild potato species during the study.",

And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",

      "With the arrival of Crew 11, four of the station's crew members \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 will be clear to undock and return to Earth next Wednesday to close out a 145-day mission.",

    "story": [
      "Running a day late, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Friday on a mission to deliver a fresh three-man one-woman crew to the International Space Station.",
      "The Falcon 9 lifted off at 11:43 a.m. EDT from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as mission control kept a close eye on clouds rolling into the area shortly before launch time.",
      "With commander Zena Cardman and co-pilot Mike Fincke monitoring cockpit displays, flanked on the left by Japanese Astronaut Kimiya Yui and on the right by cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, the Crew Dragon capsule began its climb. Nine minutes later, they reached orbit and set off after the International Space Station.",
      "\"I have no emotions but joy right now. That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime,\" radioed Cardman, making her first flight. \"Thank you, this has been an incredible honor.\"",
      "Added Fincke, a three-flight veteran: \"Boy, it's great to be back in orbit again! Thank you to SpaceX and NASA to get us here. What a ride!\"",
      "The crew\u00a0originally hoped to take off Thursday, but clouds built up over the launch site and SpaceX called off the countdown just 67 seconds before liftoff. Weather remained a concern the second time around, but in the end conditions were \"go\" for launch.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9's first stage engines shut down, the stage dropped away and the flight to orbit continued on the power of the single Merlin engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around and reversed course, flying itself back to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, chalking up SpaceX's 65th Florida landing and its 484th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "One minute after landing, the second stage engine shut down and the Crew Dragon Endeavour was released to fly on its own.",
      "Had the crew launched Thursday, it would have taken them nearly 40 hours to catch up with the space station. With a launch Friday, the trip was expected to take just 16 hours, setting up a docking at the forward Harmony module's space-facing port at 3 a.m. Saturday \u2014 the same time they would have docked had they launched Thursday.",
      "For Cardman, the trip to space finally fulfills a dream she had hoped to accomplish last year when she came within a month or so of launching to the space station as commander of an earlier Crew Dragon flight.",
      "But she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex in June 2024 in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "Wilson has not yet been assigned another flight, but Cardman was tapped to command of Crew 11.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" she said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Fincke is a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "Platonov, making his first flight, was assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program. The arrangement is intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it.",
      "Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under the agreement.",
      "A long-awaited mission aboard the space station",
      "Crew 11 will be welcomed aboard the space station by by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand: Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Clothing and personal items for Cardman are already on board, launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, her 38th, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "NASA plans to retire the space station in 2030, using a custom spacecraft being designed by SpaceX to drive the 930,000-pound football-field-size lab out of orbit, making sure it breaks up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from any populated areas.",
      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",
      "Said departing Crew 10 commander McClain: \"We feel very safe.\"",

The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

That's what we are focusing on.\"",

      "Segregation in swimming",
      "For decades, starting in the early 1900s, just as pools across the United States began to open to mixed-gender swimming, opportunities to access water started to close for Black Americans.\u00a0 In 1913, St. Louis opened its first gender-integrated swimming pool, leading to racial tensions over when and where Black swimmers could use pools. Riots began to break out at integrated swimming pools and federal mandates were imposed ordering racial segregation of pools in various cities, according to USA Swimming.",
      "University of Montana history professor Jeff Wiltse has researched racial disparities in swimming.",

      "Even so, research shows 64% of Black children have little to no swimming ability, according to USA Swimming. Black people under age 30 are 1.5 times more likely to drown than their White peers \u2014 with the disparities growing starker for children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Black children ages 10-14 years are 7.6 times more likely to drown in pools than White children, the CDC says.",
      "\"Drowning happens to be one of the most prevalent sources of death among African American males,\" said Dr. Samuel Myers, Jr. a professor and director at the Roy Wilkins Center for Human Relations and Social Justice at the University of Minnesota.",

      "Scholarships from partner organizations support new swimmers, as lessons can be cost-prohibitive for many. Outdoor Afro, one of Black People Will Swim's partner organizations, has given over 3,000 \"swimmerships\" to swimmers in the Black and Brown communities through its \"Making Waves\" program.",
      "Founder Rue Mapp told CBS News she heard too many stories of Black people drowning through her work in 30 states and the 60,000 people in their network, encouraging people to get into the great outdoors \u2013 and she felt compelled to act.",

      "\"A door needs to just be opened,\" she said. \"People go on to invest in swimming, they just need beginner lessons.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 02 Aug 2025 11:15:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Berkshire Hathaway's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett's\u00a0company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in\u00a0Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it must record the current value of its massive investment portfolio, even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprised shareholders by\u00a0selling off\u00a0a huge chunk of its Apple stake, which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it has had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft's core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",
      "Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to\u00a0give up the CEO title\u00a0at the end of the year and hand over operations to\u00a0Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman.",
      "Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement.",
      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after\u00a0rival Union Pacific announced\u00a0a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with Eastern Rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\"He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\" Seifert said. \"I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn't been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there's a logical case to be made they'll accept it.\"",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",
      "The July data appears to back up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's\u00a0most recent \"beige book,\" which compiles comments from local businesses, that many companies were delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant job report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "Amber Meade was diagnosed with a rare pain condition. It took years to find a treatment that could help.",
    "story": [
      "When Amber Meade twisted her ankle and broke a bone in her foot, she expected recovery to be easy. She needed surgery to shave down the damaged bone and make sure the nerves and tendons in her foot were where they should be.",
      "The procedure seemed to go smoothly, but in the weeks that followed, she began to feel debilitating pain. A second surgery found that a screw placed in her foot had been pressing on the head of one of her nerves. That screw was moved, and a nerve decompression was performed but the pain didn't stop.",
      "\"It would just turn black and blue, swell up really big, and I just was unable to put any weight on it,\" 41-year-old Meade said.",
      "The pain upended everything. She left her job as a surgical assistant since she could no longer stand for long periods. She was unable to take part in family activities with her two young sons. Even light breezes could trigger the pain. Resting under a blanket was unbearable, making sleep difficult. Meade compared the sensation to \"walking on a hot bed of Legos constantly, while getting stabbed with a pencil.\"",
      "Meade spent months seeing different specialists. Finally, after nearly a year, a doctor suggested Meade might have something called chronic regional pain syndrome. It was the first time Meade had heard of it. It would take even longer before she could find a treatment that helped her pain.",
      "What is chronic regional pain syndrome?",
      "Chronic regional pain syndrome, or CRPS, is a chronic disorder with no cure, said Dr. Rohan Jotwani, an interventional pain specialist and anesthesiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine. Jotwani was not involved in Meade's care. CRPS can occur after surgery, like Meade's, or from other injuries to the nerve.",
      "\"For some patients, they'll have an injury to a nerve and it will get better with time. For some patients, that injury will actually develop into its own chronic pain disorder,\" Jotwani said.",
      "Diagnosing the condition is difficult, Jotwani said. No test or scan can definitively identify it, and because it is a rare condition, many doctors may not be familiar with it, he added.",
      "Physicians have to rely on clinical criteria. Telltale hallmarks for the condition are extreme levels of pain at the source, even when nothing should be causing it - like when a bedsheet causes pain, as Meade experienced. CRPS patients may also experience swelling, changes in temperature and skin color or texture changes. They may even begin to lose function in the affected area.",
      "Diagnosing chronic regional pain syndrome is only the start, Jotwani said. Actually treating the condition requires a \"multi-pronged approach\" that can vary from person to person. Treatment typically starts with physical therapy. Patients may also take medication to decrease nerve signals in the area, so they feel less pain, or try interventional techniques like a nerve block. Meade tried multiple options, but nothing was improving her pain.",
      "\"Doing regular therapies was not working. I even heard, at 33, that I was getting older and that 'sometimes we just hurt more.' I thought that was comical,\" Meade said.",
      "Treating chronic regional pain syndrome",
      "In 2022, long after Meade's pain started, a doctor suggested she see physical therapist Dr. Anita Davis, who specializes in treating the condition and leads the comprehensive pain rehabilitation program at Brooks Rehabilitation in Florida. The pair worked to develop a physical therapy routine that would work for Meade.",
      "\"Before me, she had all of the traditional exercises ... and those things were just not possible with that much pain in her foot,\" Davis said. \"As healthcare providers, we ask patients to rate the pain from zero to 10. These folks are typically going to be at the top of the scale, even on a good day. When I ask her to do something that's painful on top of her existing pain, it's just crazy to think about doing that.\"",
      "They also worked on relaxation and emotional exercises to cope with the mental load of the constant pain.",
      "\"Pain management for Amber ... isn't just the physical aspects,\" Davis explained. \"Anything that enhances relaxing the nervous system is valuable.\"",
      "The protocol led to some improvements for Meade, but while CRPS patients can have \"symptoms subside for a length of time,\" it is \"a lifelong condition,\" Davis said.",
      "\"There's not a cure for it,\" Davis said.",
      "Working towards a less painful future",
      "Meade said she still feels pain and discomfort, and is at risk of flare-ups when the weather changes or if she steps the wrong way. In addition to working with Davis, she is taking medication and receiving ketamine infusions every few months. She said the combination of ketamine treatment and physical therapy allows her to \"do a lot more than I have been able to.\" The effects of the infusion usually last around four weeks. Meade uses that period to work on strengthening her body.",
      "\"I try to make some headway in my physical health before that starts going down, because I know it's going to,\" Meade said. \"The pain is a lot less when my physical health is better.\"",
      "Meade said even without the effects of the infusions, she is dealing with less pain than before her diagnosis and treatment. She can focus on her day-to-day activities. She sleeps better and can walk on the beach, one of her favorite activities. She can't do too much running around with her kids, but she can play catch and help with homework most days. Meade said she hopes to improve her functionality and eventually go back to work and be more active, but for now, she is grateful for what she has gained.",
      "\"I want to try to get to that point where I have less and less flares, and get up to doing what everybody enjoys doing: Working, coming home, having something to work towards, going on vacations,\" Meade said. \"Every time I have a good day, we work a little bit harder.\"",

    "summary": "The ruling centers on a proclamation issued by President Trump just hours after he returned to the White House in January, ordering the closure of the asylum system.",
    "story": [
      "A panel of federal judges on Friday limited President Trump's effort to close the U.S. asylum system at the southern border, saying his administration can't unilaterally suspend laws that bar the U.S. from deporting migrants to places where they would face persecution or torture.",
      "The ruling centers on a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump just hours after he returned to the White House in January, ordering the closure of the asylum system. U.S. border officials have relied on the order to summarily expel those entering the country illegally, without allowing them to request asylum. Mr. Trump justified the sweeping measure on the grounds that the country is facing an \"invasion\" of migrants.",
      "The three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit lifted its administrative pause on a July ruling from a federal judge who found Mr. Trump's proclamation defied U.S. laws that require the federal government to hear the claims of migrants who want to apply for humanitarian protection out of fear that they could be harmed if deported.",
      "That ruling by U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss struck down the Trump administration's asylum ban and would've required officials to stop enforcing it on a legal class comprised of migrants who are or will be in the U.S.",
      "While it lifted its stay on Moss' ruling, the D.C. Circuit panel also narrowed his order, limiting the class members eligible for relief to asylum-seekers already on American soil while Mr. Trump's decree is in effect. The appellate court also limited the scope of Moss' ruling, partially granting a request from the Trump administration.",
      "The panel allowed the Trump administration to continue using the president's proclamation to deny migrants access to the U.S. asylum system, noting that U.S. law permits, but does not require, the government to grant asylum to those who prove they could be persecuted because of their race, religion, politics or other factors.",
      "But the panel also said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to prevent migrants from applying for other forms of humanitarian protections that the U.S. is legally required to give to certain migrants fleeing persecution and torture. They're known as \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Those protections have a higher legal threshold than asylum, but unlike asylum, they are mandatory, not discretionary, and must be granted to those who meet the requirements.",
      "The panel was made up of Circuit Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, who were appointed by former President Barack Obama, as well as Gregory G. Katsas, an appointee of Mr. Trump. Each judge filed their own statements in the case, with Pillard and Katsas disagreeing with some aspects of the ruling.",
      "While they had some disagreements, all three judges said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to ignore laws around \"withholding of removal\" or Convention Against Torture protections. Pillard said she would've also blocked the administration from denying migrants the right to apply for asylum.",
      "The judges scheduled expedited proceedings to decide the merits of the case, asking both the government and the advocates challenging Mr. Trump's proclamation to file briefs through Sept. 26.",
      "The lawsuit that triggered Friday's decision was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates, who have denounced the Trump administration's border crackdown as a draconian policy that has sent migrants to harm's way.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Friday's order.",
      "Trump administration officials have credited the president's proclamation and other actions \u2014 including the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the southern border \u2014 for a historic drop in illegal crossings there.",
      "In July, just 4,600 migrants were caught crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest monthly tally recorded by Border Patrol and a figure the Biden administration reported daily during many months. While public monthly reports started in fiscal year 2000, annual data suggest the last time Border Patrol had that level of apprehensions was in the 1960s.",

      "An appeals court late Friday mostly kept in place restrictions on \"roving\" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, agreeing with a lower court judge who found that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration in Southern California appeared to have been predicated on people's race and other factors, like speaking Spanish.",
      "A panel of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit largely denied a Trump administration request to suspend the lower court ruling, which required federal immigration officials to have reasonable suspicion that someone is in the country illegally before detaining them.",
      "The immigration raids at the center of the legal battle triggered massive protests in the Los Angeles area in June, as well as widespread fears among the region's large Latino community. While most demonstrations were peaceful, instances of violence led President Trump to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles with orders to protect federal buildings and the immigration agents enforcing his far-reaching crackdown on illegal immigration. Most of them have since been demobilized.",
      "Those high-profile immigration arrests in California have continued, led by Customs and Border Protection agents who have been assigned to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers with furthering the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign \u2014 in some cases, far away from the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Beyond requiring CBP and ICE to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone, the July order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong prohibited federal agents from basing arrests on people's race or ethnicity, the fact that they speak Spanish or have an accent, their presence in a location, or their occupation.",
      "Frimpong stated that any immigration arrests that relied exclusively on these factors violated the U.S. Constitution's 4th Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.",
      "\"We agree with the district court that, in the context of the Central District of California, the four enumerated factors at issue \u2014 apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together \u2014 describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop,'\" the 9th Circuit panel wrote in its opinion Friday.",
      "The panel was comprised of Circuit Judges Ronald M. Gould, Marsha S. Berzon, and Jennifer Sung, appointees of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Joe Biden.",
      "The cases cited in the lawsuit against the Los Angeles-area immigration sweeps involved arrests in June near a car wash, a tow yard and other locations where U.S. citizens were among those questioned about their legal status and detained by federal agents. Advocates have described the operations as \"roving patrols.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit did alter one part of Frimpong's ruling, removing an exception to her ban on using the four factors that include people's race and vocation when making arrests. The panel said that an \"except as permitted by law\" clause in her order was too vague.",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates hailed Friday's ruling, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration sweeps as indiscriminate raids that have instilled fear in the Los Angeles area.",
      "\"Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to live, work, and belong in their community without being hunted, harassed, or locked away,\" said Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a Los Angeles-based group that represents those facing deportation.",
      "The Trump administration has maintained in court that federal officials rely on intelligence packages and certain information \u2014 like \"past experiences\" that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally frequent or work at certain locations \u2014 when carrying out immigration enforcement operations.",

      "Jeannie Seely, the soulful country music singer behind such standards like \"Don't Touch Me,\" has died. She was 85.",
      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \"Miss Country Soul\" for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the '60s and '70s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\"Rehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\" she said in a statement at the time. \"The unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\"",
      "Dolly Parton was one of several country music luminaries paying her tribute on Friday, saying she met Seely when they were both young and starting out in Nashville.",
      "\"She was one of my dearest friends,\" Parton said on her social media accounts. \"I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.\"",
      "Singer Charlie Daniels said on X that Seely was \"a national treasure, and one fine lady.\"",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

      "The Supreme Court has teed up a major case for next term on whether racial redistricting is unconstitutional.",
      "In a Friday night scheduling order, the high court asked parties to file briefs on whether Louisiana's creation of a second majority-minority House seat violates the 14th or 15th Amendments. The question could significantly curtail efforts to force states to create majority-minority congressional districts.",
      "The order is part of a case from the 2024 term regarding\u00a0Louisiana's congressional map\u00a0that justices decided to hold over for re-argument. The justices set a deadline of Aug. 27 for briefs to be filed by appellants on the question. Reply briefs are due Oct. 3, the Friday before the beginning of the 2025 session.",

Instead, Louisiana's efforts to redraw district lines, as all states do after the census, have resulted in a yearslong legal battle that has been before the Supreme Court twice before.",

    "summary": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" that environmental policy can't \"strangulate out of existence\" energy policy.",
    "story": [
      "When the Environmental Protection Agency announced\u00a0it would roll back regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 especially from motor vehicles \u2014 it touted annual savings for Americans of $54 billion. The EPA said eliminating Biden-era policies, which encouraged higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and electric vehicle adoption to limit tailpipe emissions, would enable consumers to \"have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car.\"",
      "But a CBS News review of the agency's own regulatory impact analysis of the proposal found that gasoline prices would increase, and nearly a half million jobs would be lost by 2035, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency, which was cited in the EPA's report.",
      "Cost of gasoline",
      "In the EPA's July analysis, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which collects and analyzes energy data, showed Biden-era policies that were adopted by the end of 2024 would dramatically bring down the future cost of gasoline because more consumers would be driving electric vehicles, hybrids and fuel-efficient cars that require less gas.",
      "It is challenging to predict the future gas prices because they're subject to high uncertainty and market volatility, but under a future scenario where Biden-era policies have been revoked under the Trump administration, the EIA projects gasoline prices will continue to increase because of a higher demand for gas-powered cars and fuel.",
      "The former administrator of the EIA, Joseph DeCarolis, explained in an email that if the government \"disincentivizes electric vehicle purchases, more consumers will purchase gasoline vehicles resulting in higher gasoline consumption and high gasoline prices for everyone.\"",
      "\"There's a clear causal connection between rescinding measures promoting electric vehicles, such as EPA tailpipe standards, and the projection of higher gasoline prices,\" he said.",
      "When asked in an interview with CBS News' \"The Takeout with Major Garrett\" about how this plan could raise gas prices, Zeldin did not directly address the question.",
      "Instead, he argued that previous policies like an electric vehicle mandate were costing trillions of dollars to regulate climate pollution, saying the policies were \"seeking to strangulate out of existence, entire sectors of our economy, and specifically our energy economy.",
      "'It's important that we are applying common sense,\" Zeldin said, \"that we are cognizant of these economic demands and that, wherever possible, when we can protect the environment and grow the economy that we will choose both.\"",
      "Neither the Biden nor Obama administrations implemented EV mandates, though both encouraged EV adoptions by Americans and businesses.",
      "Zeldin reiterated the Trump administration's stance that the EPA does not have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act unless an act of Congress changes that.",
      "\"Here's my message: If Congress wants the EPA to be regulating the heck out of carbon dioxide, well, they could put it inside of law,\" Zeldin said.",
      "Impacts on fuel efficiency",
      "Along with rolling back greenhouse gas emissions standards to limit tailpipe emissions, the EPA would also rescind fuel efficiency measures.",
      "Under Biden-era fuel efficiency policies, a new standard gas-powered car was expected to get 47.1 miles per gallon by 2027, and by 2035, cars were expected to achieve 61.2 mpg, according to EIA data.",
      "Without the Biden policies, model 2027 cars are supposed to meet a 43.6 mpg standard and gradually increase to 50.5 mpg by 2035.",
      "Light trucks and SUVs, beginning in model year 2027, under a scenario where Biden policies are revoked by the Trump administration, are set to reach fuel efficiency of 27.2 mpg and increase to 28.6 mpg by 2035. Had the Biden policies remained in place, SUVs and light trucks were expected to meet a 28.4 mpg standard in 2027 and increase to 46.2 mpg by 2035, according to EIA data.",
      "Future job losses",
      "The EIA's own data estimates that a future scenario \u2014 where Biden-Obama emissions standards are revoked \u2014 would lead to a loss of 450,000 jobs by 2035. Jobs would begin to rebound by 2045, but not enough to overcome the significant losses suffered in previous decades.",
      "Peter Huether, senior transportation research associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a statement, \"Drivers would pay thousands of dollars more in fuel and maintenance costs over the life of a vehicle, and businesses could lose billions annually from higher trucking costs\" as a result of the Trump administration's deregulation.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order hiking tariffs on U.S. imports could drive up consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for millions of businesses, trade experts said.",
      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",
      "\"For the average shopper, the effects don't always show up as a big price hike on the shelf. Instead, it's subtler \u2014 fewer options, smaller quantities and less generous promotions,\" he said. \"Companies are quietly reducing [their stockpiles], reworking product specs or stripping out expensive components to hit margin targets.\"",

      "Success stories like La Bodega's have policymakers seeking a national plan to eliminate Hep C. In Washington, a bipartisan bill backed by Senators Bill Cassidy and Chris Van Hollen would invest federal funds into wiping out the disease.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 20:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The NTSB heard testimony from air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army about the mid-air collision of an Army helicopter and passenger plane.",
    "story": [
      "Over the course of three days of investigative hearings, the National Transportation and Safety Board sought to gather more information about the factors that lead to the deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., in January between an Army helicopter and a passenger plane.",
      "The NTSB heard testimony from air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army, and the families of several of the victims were in attendance. At one point on the first day of the hearings, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said of the circumstances leading up to the crash, \"Every sign was there that there was a safety risk.\" Addressing the families, she said the hearings would be \"a critical part of our ongoing investigation.\"",
      "On Jan. 29, a Black Hawk helicopter struck an American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, as it was coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.",
      "The NTSB will continue its fact finding and will compile a final report with determinations about the probable cause, likely within the next year.",
      "Here are the top takeaways from the hearings:",
      "Helicopter's altitude measurements showed significant discrepancies",
      "The Black Hawk crew members were relying on a barometric altimeter \u2014 a gauge that determines altitude based on air pressure \u2014 which may have given them incorrect information, according to NTSB investigators. The crew was calling out altitudes that were lower than the actual height at which the helicopter was flying.",
      "The helicopter and commercial airliner collided approximately 300 feet above the Potomac River, and the maximum altitude for helicopters at that part of the route near D.C.'s Reagan Airport is 200 feet.",
      "The NTSB, as part of its investigation, tested three helicopters that are in the same battalion as the one that crashed and found that the barometric altimeter for all three was off by 80 to 130 feet. Army representatives on Wednesday told investigators that discrepancy is within the accepted variability because pilots are trained to maintain their altitude at plus or minus 100 feet.",
      "NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told CBS News' senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave the NTSB calculated the margin of error on Route Four in that area of the Potomac to be 75 feet.",
      "The Army said it is conducting additional reviews to determine how to proceed, frustrating investigators who asked why it would not make changes to the equipment, based on the findings of the NTSB tests.",
      "In 2022, an FAA working group considered moving helicopter traffic away from the airport, but ultimately did not.",
      "Airplane pilots knew they were going to be hit",
      "Transcripts from the airplane's cockpit voice recorder show the pilots received an automated verbal warning about traffic in the vicinity approximately 20 seconds before the collision. Less than two seconds before impact, the pilots shouted in alarm. Flight data indicates the plane's pilots attempted to climb to avoid the helicopter just before impact.",
      "The transcripts also reveal the pilots of the American Airlines flight questioned the move to Runway 33. The plane was originally supposed to land on Runway 1 but was redirected by air traffic controllers to Runway 33. As it was trying to land on that runway, the helicopter and plane collided.",
      "Black Hawk pilots missed key command from air traffic controller",
      "The pilots of the Black Hawk missed a key word when communicating with the air traffic control tower, according to a transcript released during the hearings of the conversation between the helicopter crew and the control tower.",
      "Fifteen seconds before the collision, DCA Tower asked the helicopter if it had the regional jet in sight. Four seconds later, the DCA Tower instructed the helicopter to pass behind the plane. The Black Hawk's cockpit voice recorder indicated that the phrase \"pass behind\" was rendered inaudible because a helicopter crew member pressed the microphone key.",
      "FAA acknowledged air traffic controller did not warn airliner that the helicopter might cross its path",
      "Although it was already known \u2014 based on control tower audio from that night \u2014 that the controller did not warn the American Airlines plane that the Black Hawk might cross its path, the FAA only openly acknowledged this for the first time during this week's hearings.",
      "In a key moment from the second day, Homendy asked FAA Air Traffic Oversight Service executive director Nick Fuller if any traffic advisories or alerts were issued to the plane. He responded, \"No safety alerts.\"",
      "Homendy then asked, \"Should the local controller have let the [plane] crew know that there was a helicopter there?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Fuller responded.",
      "Medivac pilot said presence of military helicopters in National Airport airspace makes him \"uncomfortable\"",
      "Rick Dressler, of Metro Aviation \u2013 which operates medical helicopters \u2014 was asked if there are units flying in the National Airport airspace that make him uncomfortable.",
      "\"I don't like saying that first heli of [U.S. Air Force] from Andrews (Air Base) and I don't like saying that 12th Aviation Battalion gives us all pause in the community\u2026,\" Dressler said, but \"we are all very uncomfortable when those two units are operating.\"",
      "During the hearing, the Army admitted helicopters regularly flew below flights that land at Reagan National Airport.",

    "summary": "Hiring across the U.S. was weaker than expected in July, a sign the labor market is shifting into lower gear.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 73,000 jobs in July, a slowdown from previous months and a sign the labor market is downshifting.",
      "The numbers",
      "Hiring was weaker\u00a0than expected by economists, who had forecast payroll gains of 115,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, up from 4.1% in June.",
      "The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring earlier this year was weaker than previously estimated.",
      "Factoring in the downward revisions, the three-month average employment gain from May to June was 35,000, compared to an average of 123,000 from January to April.",
      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cuts in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners are weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",
      "Beyond the ups and down of the job market, meanwhile, many Americans are struggling in an economy bifurcated between rich and poor.",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview. \"At the bottom end of the spectrum, what I hear when I'm out in the district is I hear a lot of struggle. I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef. They're buying hot dogs.\"",
      "The latest job numbers could spur Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next meeting in September, according to economists. The central bank opted this week to\u00a0hold its benchmark rate steady. President Trump has pushed for a rate cut, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers remain cautious about lowering rates until the impact of tariffs on the economy is clear.",
      "\"With this morning's payroll miss \u2014 and the downward revisions that came with it \u2014 the Fed will again need to balance a slowing job market with inflation which isn't slowing fast enough,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "According to CME FedWatch, investors see a roughly 77% probability of a Fed cut at the Fed's Sept. 16-17 meeting.",

    "story": [
      "The \"The State of Spirituality with Lisa Ling\" series explores Americans on unique paths in their faith and spirituality journeys.",
      "What does it mean to die? It's a question often only contemplated during anguished moments, but it's one Chaplain Joon Park faces every day.",
      "Park has been a Christian chaplain at Tampa General Hospital in Florida for more than a decade, working alongside 24 other chaplains of various faiths. He has seen firsthand how in times of crisis, faith often becomes a lifeline for those suffering.",
      "\"I believe it is a spiritual experience,\" Park said when asked if death is spiritual. \"So much of death involves making meaning of what is happening, questioning our own value of the life that was lived. These are all spiritual and existential things.\"",
      "How some incorporate spirituality into their lives",
      "Around 70% of U.S. adults consider themselves spiritual, meaning they believe in something bigger than themselves, like God or a creator.",
      "Randall Lindberg was one of Park's patients during a recent hospital visit. Lindberg had been in and out of the hospital frequently in recent years.",
      "\"I've been through a lot, but this is the roughest,\" Lindberg said during his stay. When Park offered to pray with him, Lindberg readily accepted.",
      "Asked if his faith had grown stronger through his medical struggles, Lindberg was emphatic: \"Absolutely. Because all I've done is prayed. There is no way I could get to this point, to this day, without that faith.\"",
      "Park believes people often turn to spirituality when facing death, but not always in expected ways.",
      "\"So there are some who pursue spirituality in a way that I need something in this moment that's bigger than the treatment, the medication, the care team, and there are some who are just angry at God,\" Park said. \"I validate both. Because both of these for me are spiritual experiences.\"",
      "Lindberg was surrounded by his family when he died two weeks ago. Shortly before his death, he expressed gratitude that his story of faith was being shared.",
      "Park's unlikely journey to being a chaplain",
      "Park's path to chaplaincy was unexpected. Growing up in Florida, he was an atheist who came from a troubled home.",
      "\"Having grown up in a very tumultuous and, unfortunately abusive household,\" Park said. \"I wanted to enter a calling where I could be that voice, the hand, heart ears, to be able to be present to someone's story, their pain, their grief.\"",
      "As a teenager, Park became involved with a local Korean church that needed a drummer for their band. When he asked if his atheism was a problem, they welcomed him anyway.",
      "\"What brought me towards faith was the love of this small church, this supernatural love,\" Park said.",
      "Now, having held thousands of hands on death beds, Park has learned that even with faith, not everything makes sense.",
      "\"We do live on a world of extreme unthinkable, unfair suffering. And on the other hand, we live in a world of the possibility of love covering pain,\" Park said. \"I as a chaplain sit at the intersection of my patients and their extreme suffering and my love for them, my care for them, our care for them, in some way representing or reflecting the love of God.\"",
      "For Park, the hospital has become a sacred space.",
      "\"I am more likely to find God in the hospital and in the hallways here than maybe even a church,\" he said. \"For me when love shows up, God shows up.\"",

      "The families of the hostages were protesting in Tel Aviv, urging Israel's government to push harder for the release of their loved ones. Witkoff, who was greeted with some applause and pleas for assistance, joined them for a closed meeting.",
      "Videos shared online showed Witkoff arriving as families chanted \"Bring them home!\" and \"We need your help.\"",
      "The Hostages of Missing Families Forum confirmed the meeting, which came a week after Witkoff quit ceasefire talks, blaming Hamas' intransigence and pledging to find other ways to free the hostages and make Gaza safe.",
      "After the meeting, the Forum released a statement saying that Witkoff had given them a personal commitment that he and President Trump would work to return the remaining hostages.",
      "\"We will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part. We will do what's right for the Gazan people,\" Witkoff said in the meeting, according to the Forum.",
      "Of the 251 hostages who were abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, around 20 are believed to be alive in Gaza. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the second-largest militant group in Gaza, released separate videos of individual hostages this week, triggering outrage among hostage families and Israeli society.",
      "Israeli media haven't broadcast the videos, calling them propaganda, but the family of 21-year-old Rom Braslavski allowed the release of a photograph showing him visibly emaciated in an unknown location. After viewing the video, Tami Braslavski, his mother, blamed top Israeli officials and demanded they meet with her.",

      "\"Do the right thing and just do it now,\" said Lior Chorev, chief strategy officer of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.",
      "Witkoff's meeting with the families came a day after he and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee toured one of the privately run U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's distribution sites in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.",
      "\"We received briefings from (the IDF) and spoke to folks on the ground. GHF delivers more than one million meals a day, an incredible feat!\" Huckabee said in a social media post.",
      "The GHF's four distribution sites, which are in zones controlled by the Israeli military, have become flashpoints of desperation, with mass crowds of people gathering outside but who have then come under fire from Israeli forces or been trampled in the resulting crush.",
      "On Saturday, hospitals in Gaza reported the killing of more than a dozen people, eight of them food-seekers, by Israeli fire.",
      "Near a GHF distribution site, Yahia Youssef, who had come to seek aid Saturday morning, described a panicked scene now grimly familiar. After helping carry out three people wounded by gunshots, he told the Associated Press he looked around and saw others lying on the ground bleeding.",
      "\"It's the same daily episode,\" Youssef said.",
      "In response to questions about several eyewitness accounts of violence at the northernmost of the Israeli-backed American contractor's four facilities, GHF said \"nothing (happened) at or near our sites.\"",
      "\"We weren't close to them (the troops) and there was no threat,\" Abed Salah, a man in his 30s who was among the crowds close to the GHF site near Netzarim corridor, said. \"I escaped death miraculously.\"",
      "From May 27 to July 31, 859 people were killed near GHF sites, according to a United Nations report published Thursday. Hundreds more have been killed along the routes of food convoys.",
      "GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to prevent deadly crowding.\u00a0Israel's military has said it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, though on Friday said it was working to make the routes under its control safer. Israel and GHF have said that the toll has been exaggerated.",

      "Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe\u00a0was sentenced Friday to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a historic case that gripped the South American nation and tarnished the conservative strongman's legacy.",
      "The sentence, which Uribe said will be appealed, followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that he attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group in the 1990s.",
      "\"Politics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\" Uribe said after Friday's hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense's request because it would be \"easy\" for the former president to leave the country to \"evade the imposed sanction.\"",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday's sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \"think much more about the solution than the problem\" during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia's Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe's alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",

      "Witkoff and Huckabee visited a GHF site in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, according to an official involved with the visit. The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "\"Today, we spent over five hours inside Gaza - level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions, and meeting with (GHF) and other agencies. The purpose of the visit was to give (President Trump) a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza,\" Witkoff said on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump \"sent his envoy to serve as his eyes and ears on the ground, reflecting his deep concern and commitment to doing what's right,\" GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay said in a statement. \"We were honored to brief his delegation, share our operations, and demonstrate the impact of delivering 100 million meals to those who need them most.\"",
      "All four of the group's distribution sites are in zones controlled by the Israeli military. Throughout their months in operation, these sites have become flashpoints of desperation, with mass crowds of people gathering outside but who have then come under fire from Israeli forces or been trampled in the resulting crush.",
      "The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, and GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to control crowds. But there has been a persistent pattern of people being killed by Israeli gunfire and even heavier weapons around the G.H.F. sites over the past five months, with the death toll in the hundreds.",
      "Witkoff's visit comes a week after U.S. officials walked away from ceasefire talks in Qatar, blaming Hamas and pledging to seek other ways to rescue Israeli hostages and make Gaza safe.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that he was sent to craft a plan to boost food and aid deliveries as part of an effort \"to save lives and end this crisis,\" while Mr. Trump wrote on social media that the fastest way to end the crisis would be for Hamas to surrender and release hostages.",
      "International organizations have said Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on food crises, said recent developments, including Israel's complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.\"",
      "Though the flow of aid has resumed, including via airdrops, the amount getting into Gaza remains far lower than what aid organizations say is needed. A security breakdown in the territory has made it nearly impossible to safely deliver food to starving Palestinians; much of the limited aid entering is hoarded and later sold at exorbitant prices.",
      "In a report issued Friday, Human Rights Watch called it \"a flawed, militarized aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths.\"",

    "summary": "South Africa, which has a strained relationship with President Trump, is the only African country singled out in the announcement with a 30% tariff increase on August 7.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg, South Africa \u2014 African countries had been bracing for bad news and scrambling for last-minute negotiations ahead of President Trump's announcement of tariffs on Thursday night.",
      "South Africa, which has had a\u00a0strained relationship with Mr. Trump, is the only African country singled out in the announcement with a 30% tariff increase on Aug. 7. Most other African countries have been hit with tariffs of 10-15%.",
      "South African Trade Minister Parks Tau said he, other ministers, and people across all sectors, from business to civil society, had been working for months to negotiate a deal with Washington, including offering to invest $3.3 billion in U.S. industries and buy natural gas but there was no response.",
      "\"My opinion, we have pulled out all stops, sending ministers from various departments, business delegations and trade unions to fully address U.S. concerns,\" Tau said.",
      "He said there was no response to their initial offer until Wednesday evening, when U.S. officials told them to improve their offer in a last-minute appeal.",
      "\"We don't have a deal, we spoke to U.S. last night (Wednesday) and they indicated that they could not confirm what the announcement would be and encouraged us to submit an enhanced proposal that would be presented to the White House,\" Tau said.",
      "In a statement Thursday night, Tau said, \"We are working with urgency and resolve to implement real, practical interventions that defend jobs and position South Africa competitively in a shifting global landscape.\"",
      "In neighboring Lesotho, the government declared a state of emergency following the declaration in April that the U.S. would impose a 50% tariff \u2014 the highest in the world. The threat of tariffs had devastating effects reverberating across the tiny mountain kingdom of just over 2 million people. The notice came just months after U.S. aid funding cuts and now the threat of tariffs meant many garment companies closed their doors or reduced their staff to half-time in the ensuing months.",
      "Lesotho is often referred to as the \"denim capital of Africa\" as it is where Levi's and other brands are manufactured, as well as other textiles for companies like JCPenney, Walmart and Costco.",
      "The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), created in 2000 as part of the \"trade not aid\" philosophy, gives some 35 African countries duty-free access to the U.S. for their goods. The textile industry, the country's main employer, providing as many as 50000 jobs, has had a trade surplus with the U.S. for the last few years. This is why some economists believe Mr. Trump singled out Lesotho for the hefty tariffs.",
      "Addressing Congress in March, Mr. Trump was listing off global cuts that he called wasteful expenditure and cited Lesotho as an African nation \"no one has ever heard of.\" His words reverberated across the country and started months of diplomacy that culminated in various concessions, including a willingness to accept deportees from the U.S., as well as other financial incentives likely helped revise the massive tariffs threatened downwards.",
      "Most African countries will have a 10-15% tariff imposed but remain concerned as the September deadline to renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act approaches. Some analysts believe Mr. Trump will cancel it. Losing the free entry to the U.S. will mean all goods now exported under AGOA duty-free will be subjected to tariffs and will significantly impact these countries' economic growth. The new tariffs, combined with the loss of AGOA, could see increasing inflation and the depreciation of currencies in these countries, economists warn. It's a hit that many countries will struggle to absorb.",
      "Analysts are now looking toward the G20 in November in South Africa as a possibility to create new regional and global trade deals that do not include the U.S.",
      "\"I think we toss the U.S. out of the G20 for so many reasons and get tougher on Donald Trump to know collective will, that is the only response now,\" Patrick Bond, the distinguished professor and director of social change at the University of Johannesburg, told CBS News.",
      "Earlier this week, on board Air Force One, Mr. Trump told reporters that he might skip the G20 altogether, saying, \"I might send someone else because I have had a lot of problems with South Africa, they have very bad policies.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has falsely claimed the country has race-based laws, with the government seizing white farmers' land. As a result, Mr. Trump has offered refugee status to Afrikaans farmers, which several hundred have already accepted and are now living in the U.S. The U.S. government is also unhappy with South Africa's case of genocide at the International Criminal Court.",
      "With Thursday night's announcement of a 30% tariff for South Africa, it's clear the political tension between the countries now has economic consequences.",
      "South Africa's Reserve Bank Governor, Lesetja Kganyago, had warned in mid-July that a 30% tariff would mean a loss of 100,000 jobs. Economists warn that the country's agriculture and automotive industries will be the hardest hit.",
      "Bond warned South Africa could face a dire economic crisis if it doesn't shift quickly to diversify its export markets.",
      "\"We must diversify export markets and look at our own infrastructure projects and have massive subsidies for that,\" he said. \"None of the approaches in our toolbox are working, so we must move to new options and protect our industries.\"",
      "The South African government is concerned that the new tariffs will spark a lack of confidence in the market, bringing massive job losses and capital flight.",
      "President Cyril Ramaphosa speaking Friday to media at the swearing in of a new police minister avoided being pinned down on a response to the tariffs saying only: \"We deal with every government with the required respect and dignity and that is how we conduct our foreign policy and diplomatic matters and we expect that respect to be reciprocated\" before conceding that \"its too risky to be dependent on one country for trade.\"",

The special envoy and the ambassador will brief the president immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "Leavitt said the administration will provide more details once the president approves a plan. She also said the meetings Witkoff and Huckabee have had with Netanyahu and other leaders have been productive.",

    "story": [
      "The death toll among Palestinians waiting for food and other aid in Gaza continued to climb as President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived on a visit to the region. Witkoff landed in Israel on Thursday, and the White House said he and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee will visit Gaza\u00a0on Friday to inspect aid operations.",
      "Witkoff is expected to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and a possible ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told The Associated Press.",
      "This would be the first meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu since both Israel and the U.S. called their negotiation teams home from Qatar one week ago. Witkoff said at the time that Hamas showed \"a lack of desire\" to reach a truce.",
      "Over the last 24 hours, at least 91 Palestinians were killed and more than 600 wounded while attempting to get aid in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. This includes 54 people killed while awaiting food in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing on Wednesday, the ministry said.",
      "That figure is expected to rise further, as many of those killed or wounded were brought to isolated, smaller hospitals in northern Gaza and have not yet been counted.",
      "The Israeli military said Palestinians surrounded aid trucks and the Israeli military fired warning shots, but that it isn't aware of any injuries stemming from Israeli fire. A security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said the gunfire came from within the crowd and altercations between Palestinians attempting to access aid.",
      "The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducted 251 others. Fifty hostages are still in captivity in Gaza, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which operates under the Hamas government. Its count doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.",
      "In Jerusalem, about 50 people, including families of some of the approximately 50 hostages still being held in Gaza, demonstrated on Thursday in front of Netanyahu's office calling for an end to the war.",
      "Israel says it will facilitate the entry of more aid into Gaza",
      "Under heavy international pressure, Israel announced a series of measures over the weekend to facilitate the entry of more international aid to Gaza, but aid workers say much more is needed.",
      "The Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid in Gaza said 270 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Wednesday, and 32 pallets of aid were airdropped into the Strip. That amount is far lower than the 500 to 600 trucks per day that aid organizations say are needed.",
      "The international community has heaped criticism on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. International organizations said that Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years, but that recent developments, including a complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean that the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.\"",
      "The situation has led some leading Israeli rights groups to accuse Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "\"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,\" Yuli Novak, the director of the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, said Monday.",
      "\"Systematic destruction of the health care system, denial of access to food, blocking of medial evacuations and using humanitarian aid to advance military targets all indicate a clear pattern of conduct, a pattern that reveals intent,\" Guy Shalev from the Israeli group Physicians for Human Rights said.",
      "Israel vehemently denied the charge.",
      "\"It is baseless,\" Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. \"There is no intent, key for the charge of genocide.\"",
      "Further pressure on Israel and Hamas as U.S. sanctions Palestinian Authority",
      "In recent days, major allies France, Britain and Canada have broken from the U.S. in saying they're making plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September.",
      "Mr. Trump said Canada's announcement Wednesday \"will make it very hard\" for the U.S. to reach a trade agreement with its northern neighbor.",
      "\"Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,\" Trump said in his post on Truth Social around midnight. \"That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh Canada!!!\"",
      "On Tuesday, Arab countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt jointly called on Hamas to end its rule in Gaza and disarm, the AFP news agency reported. The European Union and Arab League countries were among 17 nations that endorsed a seven-page document agreed to at a United Nations conference on a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "\"In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State,\" the declaration said, according to AFP.",
      "On Thursday, the U.S. revoked visas for Palestinian officials linked to the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization, marking a further deterioration of their relations with the United States. It did not specify which officials would be sanctioned.",
      "The State Department said the organizations had violated longstanding agreements not to undermine the peace process or globalize the conflict through international courts. It accused them of inciting violence and supporting attackers and their families.",
      "Some of the recent announcements of plans to recognize Palestinian statehood have been predicated on reforming the Palestinian Authority, which is widely seen as corrupt and has little support among Palestinians. The PA has also clashed bitterly with Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.",
      "The PLO, the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinian people, oversees the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",

      "\"The deepening suffering of civilians leaves no room for delay in co-ordinated international action to support peace, security, and the dignity of all human life,\" Carney said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Canada has had a long-standing position supporting the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel, but has said recognition should come as part of a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict. Carney said Wednesday that prospects of a two-state solution \"have been steadily and gravely eroded.\"",
      "\"Preserving a two-state solution means standing with all people who choose peace over violence or terrorism, and honouring their innate desire for the peaceful co-existence of Israeli and Palestinian states as the only roadmap for a secure and prosperous future,\" Carney said.",
      "Canada said its recognition is \"predicated on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to much-needed reforms, including the commitments by Palestinian Authority President [Mahmoud] Abbas to fundamentally reform its governance, to hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarize the Palestinian state.\"",

      "Tanden's lawyer told Fox News at the time that she \"consistently followed a protocol\" that was used by both Republican and Democratic administrations in the past.",
      "\"That same protocol existed in the Clinton and Obama administrations, which Ms. Tanden learned in discussions with previous staff secretaries from those administrations. She further understood and believed that the same process was followed in the Trump 1 and Bush administrations,\" the lawyer said.",

      "Kevin O'Connor",
      "Former White House physician Kevin O'Connor was the second ex-Biden administration official to appear when he came in on July 9, and the first to appear under subpoena.",
      "Before serving as White House doctor, however, O'Connor was known to be a close associate of the Biden family for years.",
      "Investigators were hoping to learn whether O'Connor knowingly obscured signs of advanced aging or loss of mental acuity in Biden. He notably met with a Parkinson's Disease expert at the White House at one point, according to the New York Times \u2013 though the revelations were downplayed by the White House at the time.",
      "O'Connor's lawyers had attempted to delay his scheduled deposition date over concerns that the scope of the committee's investigation would violate doctor-patient confidentiality.",
      "He ultimately did appear when Comer rejected his delay request, but O'Connor was in and out of the committee room in less than an hour after pleading the Fifth Amendment to all questions, save for his name.",

      "She served as his trip director for the 2020 campaign before being hired to the White House as deputy director of Oval Office Operations and a special assistant to the president.",
      "Williams repeatedly told committee staff during her sit-down that she did not \"recall\" various things \"an untold number of times,\" but that she believed Biden was fit to be president today, a source told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Examples include she could not recall if she spoke with President Biden in the last week, if teleprompters were used for Cabinet meetings, if there were discussions about President Biden using a wheelchair, if there were discussions about a cognitive test, if she discussed a mental or physical decline of President Biden, if she ever had to wake President Biden up and how she got involved with his 2020 campaign,\" the source said.",
      "Anthony Bernal",
      "Anthony Bernal, who was nicknamed Jill Biden's \"work husband\" for their close relationship, was the second person subpoenaed to appear.",
      "Like O'Connor, Bernal's July 16 deposition lasted less than an hour after he pleaded the Fifth Amendment to investigators.",
      "Bernal served as former Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the First Lady. He also still appears to work for the Bidens, according to LinkedIn, which says he works for Jill Biden specifically.",
      "\"During his deposition today, Mr. Bernal pleaded the Fifth when asked if any unelected official or family members executed the duties of the President and if Joe Biden ever instructed him to lie about his health,\" Comer said in a statement after Bernal's deposition.",

      "Tomasini followed O'Connor and Bernal's lead in pleading the Fifth Amendment, which people coming in voluntarily cannot do.",
      "\"During her deposition today, Ms. Tomasini pleaded the Fifth when asked if Joe Biden, a member of his family, or anyone at the White House instructed her to lie regarding his health at any time,\" Comer said in a statement after her deposition.",
      "\"She also pleaded the Fifth when asked if she ever advised President Biden on the handling of classified documents found in his garage, if President Biden or anyone in the White House instructed her to conceal or destroy classified material found at President Biden\u2019s home or office, and if she ever conspired with anyone in the White House to hide information regarding the Biden family\u2019s \u2018business\u2019 dealings.\"",

      "Klain told investigators that he believed Biden's memory got worse over time, but he still had the ability to govern, a source familiar with his interview told Fox News Digital.",
      "The source said Klain also claimed to have heard concerns about Biden's political viability from both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Biden's own national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, by 2024, though it's not clear if those concerns are tied to his mental acuity nor that they spoke to Klain together.",
      "A spokesperson for Sullivan vehemently denied the account.",
      "Klain also told investigators that Biden appeared tired and ill before the 2024 debate, the source said.",
      "In a letter requesting his appearance, Comer quoted Klain as cutting Biden's debate prep short last year, \"due to the president\u2019s fatigue and lack of familiarity with the subject matter,\" adding that Biden \"didn\u2019t really understand what his argument was on inflation,\" citing a POLITICO report from earlier this year.",

      "Longtime Biden advisor Mike Donilon told House Oversight Committee investigators he could've gotten up to $8 million had Biden won re-election. (Getty Images)",
      "Donilon first began working for Biden in 1981 as a pollster when Biden was the junior U.S. senator from Delaware.",
      "Alongside Ricchetti, he was one of two Biden aides who were present when he drafted his announcement dropping out of the 2024 presidential race.",
      "Donilon told investigators he received $4 million to work for Biden's 2024 re-election campaign and would have gotten $4 million more if Biden had won, a source told Fox News Digital.",

      "They argued that Noem declining to extend their TPS status was, by law, supposed to be reached based on an individualized analysis of each country. The judge found that Noem likely failed to condition TPS termination on factors specific to the immigrants' countries of origin.",

      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts.

Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about.

The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",

In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",

A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers.

If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive.

This method is so inconspicuous that anyone glancing at your phone will think you're jotting down groceries or ideas, not exchanging private messages. It's subtle, smart and makes the most of what's already on your device. Just remember that when your quiet conversation is over, tidy up behind you. Stop sharing and then delete the note to keep things truly under wraps. Sometimes, the best privacy solutions are hidden in the apps you use every day.",

      "At the heart of these changes is the ability to favorite drivers, a new option that helps you reconnect with drivers who deliver top-tier service. Once a ride is over, you can mark that driver as a favorite. Lyft will then try to match you with them again for future scheduled rides. It's a simple way to reward great service and make your next trip feel more comfortable, familiar, and consistent.",
      "The Lyft app displays a post-trip favorite driver feature. (Lyft)",
      "Why Lyft's new features strengthen rider-driver connections",
      "The goal behind these updates is to create stronger connections between drivers and passengers. According to Lyft, this new system also opens up better earning opportunities for drivers. If a driver gets favorited, they'll receive priority access to that rider's scheduled trips, a win-win for both sides.

The new Lyft Safety Hub will serve as a central location for all safety settings. There, riders can manage features like audio recording, PIN verification, location sharing, and their list of blocked or favorite drivers. This is part of Lyft's ongoing effort to become the safest rideshare platform in North America.",
      "Lyft Safety Hub on the Lyft app. (Lyft)",
      "What this means for you",
      "These updates from Lyft reflect a broader shift occurring across the rideshare industry: a shift toward more personalized, rider-centric experiences. Companies like Lyft and Uber are recognizing that convenience alone isn't enough; riders also want consistency, control and safety built into every trip. By allowing you to favorite trusted drivers and block those you'd prefer to avoid, Lyft is giving you more say in who you share a car with. These tools create a more predictable, comfortable experience, especially for regular commuters or those who rely on ridesharing for daily routines.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The introduction of features like the Safety Hub shows how rideshare apps are becoming more responsive to what riders value most: clear choices, transparent settings and the ability to shape their own ride environment. This evolution marks a significant departure from the one-size-fits-all model that once defined the rideshare experience.",
      "As the industry becomes increasingly competitive, companies are focusing on trust, personalization and fostering long-term relationships between riders and drivers. For you, this means future rides won't just be about getting from point A to point B. They'll be tailored to your preferences, comfort and peace of mind.",

      "Viral robot freakout sparks safety concerns",
      "In the viral clip, the full-sized humanoid robot named DeREX is suspended from a crane inside a factory in China. Surrounded by two handlers, it suddenly starts thrashing its limbs without warning. The force is so intense it knocks over nearby equipment and nearly causes the crane to collapse.",
      "As chaos unfolds, one stunned observer shouts, \"Oh my god, what the (expletive) was that?\" Another technician replies,\u00a0\"What the (expletive) did you guys run?\" The dramatic exchange, captured on video, has only deepened speculation.",

      "Cix Liv, the robot handler who shared the footage on X, offered a possible explanation, saying, \"The technical reason is we ran a full-body policy while the feet weren't touching the ground. Don't do that.\"",

      "The image shows a component related to lithium-ion battery recycling technology\u00a0 (WPI)",
      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "WPI's clean, scalable solution: A hydrometallurgical upgrade",
      "Led by Professor Yan Wang, the WPI team developed a method that uses hydrometallurgy to extract critical metals from spent Ni-lean cathodes, then upcycles them into Ni-rich 83Ni cathode materials, which are used in next-generation batteries. Here's what makes it revolutionary:",

      "Professor Yan Wang working in the lab at WPI\u00a0 (WPI)",
      "Why this matters for clean energy and supply chains",
      "Battery waste is piling up, and mining for fresh materials isn't sustainable. Wang's team has proven that high-performance batteries can be made from recycled components at scale.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "This reduces our dependence on destructive mining operations, lowers emissions, and makes battery manufacturing more resilient to global supply shocks. Even better? These recycled batteries perform just as well as new ones. Unlike traditional methods that recover raw metals but degrade performance, this upcycling process regenerates high-value cathodes with next-gen chemistry, turning old batteries into components even better aligned with today's EV and storage systems.",
      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "If you think electric trucking means buying a brand-new semi, think again. Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn't replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
      "In 2025, transportation was the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. And for the first time, heavy-duty trucks edged out passenger vehicles in how much pollution they produce. That makes freight the low-hanging fruit in the fight to reduce emissions. But electrifying it? That's where things get tricky.",
      "Electric semis are pricey. They're also heavy, have limited range, and take too long to charge. Trucking companies, many of them small operators, run on razor-thin margins and can't afford long downtimes. Public fast-charging for trucks barely exists. And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

      "In Greek mythology, the Sirens were creatures whose irresistible song lured sailors to their doom. Odysseus, the hero of\u00a0\"The Odyssey,\" wanted to hear that famous song. But he knew it was dangerous. So, he had his men tie him to the mast and block their ears with beeswax. Then, they sailed toward the Island of the Sirens. Why? Because Odysseus understood that once he heard their song, he wouldn't be able to resist. And that song always leads to trouble.",

      "A dad working on his laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "How scammers trick your parents even when they know better",
      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail. Alternatively, a financial adviser could be deftly playing on your parents' anxieties around money since retiring. Another common scam involves a suspiciously foreign-sounding Microsoft customer-support worker calling to inform your parents that the computer they don't have or never use has been infected with a virus.",
      "Emotional triggers are the scammer's best tool",
      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "Use a data removal service to protect your parents",
      "The good news is that a\u00a0data removal service can scrub both people-search sites and the databases of those other, more shadowy data brokers clean of your parents' information. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "At the end of the day, protecting your parents isn't just about warnings or knowledge. It's about cutting off scammers before they even get a chance to call or reach out in some way. Removing personal data from sketchy sites is the secret weapon here. It's simple, effective, and frees your loved ones from emotional traps.",

      "The Walker S2 humanoid robot switches out its own battery\u00a0 (UBTech)",
      "How the Walker S2 robot swaps its own battery",
      "Instead of shutting down to recharge, the Walker S2 walks to a nearby swap station. When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles. But this time, it\u2019s for humanoid robots.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What the Walker S2 robot can do",
      "The Walker S2 is the size of a small adult. It\u2019s 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 95 pounds. It has two 48-volt lithium batteries. When one runs out, it switches to the other. Each battery lasts approximately two hours while walking or four hours when the robot is standing still. Swap stations also monitor battery health. If a battery starts to degrade, a technician can replace it.",

They have vision systems to detect battery levels. A green light indicates that a battery is ready to use. The robot reads that, picks it up and plugs it in using a USB-style connector. The robot also features a display face to communicate its status to human workers. And, yes, there\u2019s an emergency stop button, just in case.",

      "China is investing heavily in robotics. More than 1,600 robotics companies operate in Shenzhen, UBTech\u2019s home base.

      "\"I think we will, yeah, I do, I think we will,\" Trump said Tuesday evening from the White House in response to a question by reporters regarding whether he will allow Ukrainians to remain in the U.S. until the war ends.",
      "\"We have a lot of people that came in from Ukraine, and we're working with them,\" he added.",

      "TRUMP ISSUES FIRM 10-DAY DEADLINE TO PUTIN TO END WAR",
      "Concern over the temporary protected status (TPS) afforded to roughly 240,000 Ukrainians who fled the war to the U.S. under the government program known as Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), first implemented in April 2022, has been heightened since the first day that Trump entered office in January when he issued the executive order titled \"Securing our Borders.\"",
      "Eight days later, on Jan. 28, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed that the order had paused the government program, barring additional Ukrainians from entering the U.S. under those protections.",
      "However, even as TPS remained in place for Ukrainians already stateside, concern remained high amid reports in March that the president was considering the removal of this protection status.",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the reporting by Reuters and called it \"fake news\" before adding \"no decision has been made at this time.\"",
      "However, when asked about the reporting later that day, Trump said, \"We\u2019re certainly not looking to hurt them.",
      "\"And I\u2019m looking at that, and there were some people that think that\u2019s appropriate, and some people don\u2019t, and I\u2019ll be making a decision pretty soon,\" he added.",
      "Confusion remained after DHS in April reportedly distributed an email to some Ukrainians under the TPS program notifying them that their status had been revoked, and they would need to leave the country within seven days.",
      "DHS later confirmed this was sent in error, but the mistake highlighted the uncertainty that persisted for months.",

      "Trump on Tuesday also announced that Putin has 10 days to enter into some sort of peace deal with Ukraine or face secondary sanctions on its chief commodity \u2013 oil.",
      "Neither the White House nor DHS immediately responded to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions regarding the president\u2019s recent announcement, and it remains unclear if the U4U program could also be reopened to other Ukrainian citizens as the war continues.",

      "French President Macron warned that if the U.S. and China force nations to chose sides in geopolitical spat, they will 'kill the global order.' (Credit: Reuters)",
      "From Gaza to Greenland, French President Emmanuel Macron appears to be taking increasingly bolder diplomatic stabs at President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy even though such gestures don\u2019t \"carry weight\" as Trump pointed out last week after the French leader declared his intention to recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "\"French Presidents from Charles de Gaulle onwards have\u00a0reveled in the idea that they are a natural counterweight to U.S. foreign policy on the international stage,\" Alan Mendoza, executive director of the U.K.-based Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital Monday.",
      "Charles de Gaulle was\u00a0France\u2019s long-serving leader in the 1950s and 1960s and was famously resistant to U.S. global dominance, withdrawing his country from NATO\u2019s military command structure in a bid to increase its military independence and criticizing U.S. policies in Eastern Europe and Vietnam.",

      "Macron met with Trump in Washington on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)",
      "Such contrarian actions, Mendoza said, \"have in many ways defined the French Fifth Republic, with\u00a0larger-than-life characters thrusting their views onto the world stage.",
      "\"The difference now is that France matters far less globally than it did 60 years ago,\" he said, adding that a weakening of the European country\u2019s economy and its military might \"means that where once de Gaulle could roar, now Macron whimpers.\"",
      "\"What was once a sign of French strength and confidence now therefore looks more like a desperate attempt to escape irrelevance,\" said Mendoza.",
      "In a dramatic announcement last week, Macron said that at the United Nations General Assembly in September France intends to declare its recognition of a Palestinian state, even as Palestinian terror groups continue to battle Israel in the Gaza Strip.",

      "It was also criticized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the decision \"reckless\" and \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.\" He said the U.S. strongly rejected such a plan.",
      "Trump merely dismissed Macron\u2019s Gaza move, telling reporters at the White House Friday \"what he says doesn\u2019t matter.\"",

      "This is not the first time the president has discounted Macron as inconsequential.",
      "Last month, after the French president speculated about Trump\u2019s reasons for leaving the G7 summit in Canada early and returning to Washington, the president wrote on his Truth Social platform, \"Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay Tuned!\"",
      "In the same post, Trump said Macron was \"publicity seeking.\"",

      "The disparaging comments came after Macron directly contradicted Trump\u2019s foreign policy by stopping on his way to the summit in the semi-autonomous Arctic territory of Greenland, which Trump has said he wishes to acquire.",
      "\"Greenland is not to be sold, not to be taken,\" Macron declared in a\u00a0diplomatic stab at Trump\u2019s foreign policy and seemingly an attempt to rally support from\u00a0other European countries to stand up to the U.S.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s ambitions for Greenland, Macron, according to Reuters, said, \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what allies do. \u2026 \u00a0It\u2019s important that Denmark and the Europeans commit themselves to this territory, which has very high strategic stakes and whose territorial integrity must be respected.\"",
      "In February, the French president paid his first visit to the White House since Trump\u2019s return to power, and while the meeting appeared to be\u00a0warm, it also\u00a0came amid tension over the U.S. approach to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "Hours before the meeting, the U.S. voted against a United Nations resolution drafted by Ukraine and the European Union condemning Russia for its invasion.",

      "They\u00a0stem from Macron\u2019s\u00a0\"desire to be relevant and to stand for something,\" he said.\u00a0\"The French are famous contrarians, but they do it for the sake of being contrarian.\"",
      "Reuel Marc Gerecht, a resident scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Washington, D.C., think tank, said Macron was no\u00a0\"different from most European leaders. \u2026 Trump just isn\u2019t their cup of tea.\"",

      "\"The American way\u00a0has been enormously appealing in Europe since World War\u00a0II, but it has come in part at the expense of the French, who have culturally lost a lot of ground to the Anglophones, especially the Americans,\" he said. \"Consequently, many Frenchmen have a love-hate relationship with the U.S.\"",
      "On\u00a0Macron, Gerecht added, \"He is part of the French elite. They are a bright lot who punch way above their weight, but, educationally, temperamentally, they are nearly the opposite of Trump.\"",

      "The past week was already primed to be a doozy for data, with investors and analysts eagerly anticipating updates about economic growth, jobs and the Fed\u2019s latest interest rate decision. Major companies like Apple, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft reported their latest financial results. Trump\u2019s deadline for trade deals was set for Friday.",
      "But what happened this week turned out to be more extraordinary than anyone expected.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sending off red flares: We\u2019re on the precipice of a recession,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, a financial research company. \u201cIf tariffs keep increasing, I don\u2019t know how we avoid a recession.\u201d",
      "Coming into this week, the U.S. economy had generally been considered in good shape despite mounting uncertainty and concerns about slowing growth.",
      "The week kicked off in Scotland with the announcement of a deal with the European Union that would set tariffs at 15%, ending months of uncertainty surrounding the United States\u2019 largest trade partner.",
      "Trade talks then moved to Sweden, where leading officials from the U.S. and China held two days of negotiations. The talks yielded neither a deal nor a formal extension of the two countries\u2019 trade truce, which will expire Aug. 12.",
      "\u201cThe meetings were very constructive,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters after the talks wrapped up. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t given the sign-off.\u201d",
      "Given the importance of trade relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the cliffhanger meant the cloud of uncertainty created by Trump\u2019s tariffs gambit persisted, despite some deals having been struck with other major trading partners including the European Union and Japan.",
      "Tuesday offered little reason for renewed optimism, with the international shipping giant UPS again declining to issue financial forecasts for the rest of the year, prompting investor concern about the impact of Trump\u2019s shifting trade war and causing company shares to tank.",
      "Wednesday began with the Commerce Department reporting figures for second-quarter gross domestic product, or GDP, which measures economic growth in the U.S. The data showed an annual gain of 3%, beating expectations. But the same report also contained worrisome signs about business investment, even as price growth was accelerating.",
      "Later that day, the Federal Reserve announced it was keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, in part due to those inflation concerns. That drew the ire of Trump, who has spent weeks hounding Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower the key lending rate. In remarks following the central bank\u2019s announcement, Powell pointed to ongoing concerns about the potential for Trump\u2019s tariffs to raise prices for U.S. consumers \u2014 but critically, referred to the jobs market as \u201csolid.\u201d Notably, two members of the rate-setting board \u2014 both appointed by Trump \u2014 dissented, the first time that has occurred in more than three decades.",
      "Blowout earnings from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta \u2014 two companies at the center of the AI investment boom, which is a key part of Trump\u2019s domestic agenda \u2014 helped the stock market reach fresh highs early Thursday. Microsoft briefly became the second company to be worth more than $4 trillion on the stock market.",
      "Yet by the time the markets closed that day, stocks had erased their gains after Trump sent letters to more than a dozen pharmaceutical companies demanding they offer U.S. customers more competitive pricing for new medicines and giving them 60 days to comply.",
      "Late Thursday evening, Trump unveiled a sweeping new set of tariffs that unilaterally imposed higher import taxes on a host of trading partners, including allies like Canada and Taiwan. The new effective rate of more than 15% delivered a shock to global markets. The month closed with the Treasury Department reporting monthly tariff collections had hit another new record of more than $29 billion.",
      "In an interview with NBC News that evening, Trump touted the expansive new tariffs, saying he believed it all was going \u201cvery well, very smooth,\u201d even as he remained open to new deals.",
      "Then Friday\u2019s jobs report arrived.",
      "At 8:30 a.m., the Bureau of Labor Statistics published revisions showing sharply lower jobs totals for May and June than initially reported, while also finding the economy had added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. All told, it suggested the U.S. has gained an average of just 35,000 jobs a month over the past three months \u2014 and excluding the increases seen in the health care industry, the U.S. had lost more jobs than it had created.",
      "The unemployment rate, however, remained at 4.2%, a sign that overall joblessness remains subdued. However, many economists noted the data point is largely attributable to the president\u2019s immigration crackdown, which is shrinking the overall labor force.",
      "The White House hailed the loss of foreign-born workers as it also noted a more sustained increase in the labor force among native-born workers.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re swapping out foreign-born job holders for American-born job holders, I think that\u2019s a win,\u201d White House chief economic adviser Stephen Miran told Axios.",
      "He added that there was \u201creally good reason\u201d to believe the economy would improve, citing Trump\u2019s trade deals and tax cuts.",
      "But for Trump, the public\u2019s larger takeaway of a weakening labor market prompted an unprecedented response: Shortly after 2 p.m. ET on Friday, the president announced his intention to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over what he said were errors in the jobs data, as well as accusations the agency had \u201cmanipulated\u201d the numbers prior to the 2024 election. Neither allegation has been corroborated.",
      "The move sent shockwaves through Washington, with some experts warning it risked lowering the U.S. to the level of authoritarian regimes.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is once again destroying the credibility of our government by firing expert and nonpartisan officials because he does not like the facts that they present,\u201d said Max Stier, the CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. \u201cGovernments that go down this path find themselves in ugly territory very quickly.\u201d",
      "It was not clear whether the outgoing BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, a Biden administration appointee, would seek to challenge her removal in court. As it turns out, in addition to nominating a new head of the critical data agency, Trump will also get to name a new member to the Fed\u2019s rate-setting board after Adriana Kugler, another Joe Biden appointee, unexpectedly announced her resignation late Friday. Both nominees still must be confirmed by the Senate, which remains narrowly controlled by the GOP.",
      "Asked if the White House continued to harbor concerns about the direction of the economy, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, issued the following statement:",
      "\u201cIn his first term, President Trump used an America First economic agenda to deliver historic working class prosperity and the first reduction in wealth and income inequality in decades. In his [second] term, President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale \u2014 as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come.\u201d",
      "That view is not shared among other economists.",
      "\u201cAll of this is troubling: a weakening economy, slowing labor market, rising inflation, rising tariffs, political influence on a statistical agency, more political influence on Fed, tensions with Russia & the onset of a market correction,\u201d EY Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco wrote on X."

      "NBC News asked people who recently finished technical school, college or graduate school how their job application process was going, and in more than 100 responses, the graduates described months spent searching for a job, hundreds of applications and zero responses from employers \u2014 even with degrees once thought to be in high demand, like computer science or engineering. Some said they struggled to get an hourly retail position or are making salaries well below what they had been expecting in fields they hadn\u2019t planned to work in.",

      "Driving that trend is hesitation among employers to hire new workers amid wider economic uncertainty in the midst of President Donald Trump\u2019s shifting tariff policies and federal spending cuts, economists have said. Then there is the emergence of AI, which some companies have said they are using to replace certain entry-level jobs, like those in customer support or basic software development.",

      "More than seven months after graduating, he\u2019s applied for more than 100 jobs and gotten two interviews and only one job offer \u2014 for the 4 a.m. shift at Starbucks, which he didn\u2019t take because the hours would make it too hard to pursue other opportunities. Among the jobs that turned him down: an hourly role at Costco and a customer service job in the call center at State Farm.",
      "\u201cThe very few openings that there were would be so competitive that you would pretty much get a rejection notice as soon as you apply,\u201d said Mitchell, who\u2019s been living at home with his parents in the Atlanta area and spending down his savings.",

      "Those cuts mark a retrenchment after the hiring spree those companies went on after the pandemic, while an abundance of workers are vying for the remaining jobs, said Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. Early adoption of AI is also likely driving some of the cuts and leading employers to rethink hiring plans in anticipation of AI\u2019s future role, Shrivastava said. Mitchell worries that could hurt his prospects long term, so he isn\u2019t limiting his search to tech jobs.",

      "Looking for work beyond the power plant industry has also been a struggle, as other employers in Emporia, about an hour from Wichita, have been cutting jobs. Tyson closed a meat processing plant there at the start of the year, eliminating over 800 jobs, and the Michelin tire company cut 80 jobs last year, nearly 40% of its workforce. The town had an unemployment rate of 5.8% in June, when not adjusted for seasonal employment, which was the highest in the state, where the overall unemployment rate was 4.1%, according to the state\u2019s Department of Labor.",

But when he started looking for a job, he learned that he would need to go through a five-year apprenticeship program with the local electrical workers union and travel up to two hours away for work, which would be a financial strain because he and his wife only have one car.",
      "\u201cI just have to figure out a way to get a car and make peace with the fact that there\u2019s a chance I may be put somewhere really far from home and I never get to see my family very much for five years, but I don\u2019t know what else to do really,\u201d Young said.",
      "His wife makes more than $90,000 a year \u2014 a salary he would have thought would be enough in a small town in Kansas. But not anymore, he said. An apartment that would have cost $600 a month in 2019 is now $1,000. His weekly trip to the grocery store has gone from costing $80 to $180. Then there are his $20,000 in student loans, and the rising cost of insurance, gas and utilities.",

      "Federal officials are investigating former special counsel Jack Smith after President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans have alleged that his investigations into then-candidate Trump amounted to illegal political activity.",
      "The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it's investigating Smith for alleged violations of the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits certain political activities by government officials. Trump and his allies have not presented specific evidence of wrongdoing.",
      "The OSC is different from the type of special counsel\u2019s office formerly headed by Smith, who was appointed by the Department of Justice. The independent agency lacks the authority to bring criminal charges and prosecute individuals who violate the Hatch Act, but it may seek disciplinary action for a federal government employee, such as removal from the civil workforce, or refer its findings of Hatch Act violations to the DOJ for investigation.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., requested that the OSC investigate Smith for \u201cunprecedented interference in the 2024 election.\u201d A source familiar with the matter says the OSC affirmed to Cotton that it is proceeding with its inquiry following his request.",
      "Smith was tapped as special counsel by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to oversee the federal investigations into Trump, who announced his candidacy for the presidency three days before Smith\u2019s appointment. Smith would go on to bring two criminal indictments against then-candidate Trump in 2023 but resigned just over one week before Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2024 \u2014 without ever having brought the two cases to trial.",
      "\u201cJack Smith\u2019s legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns,\u201d Cotton wrote on X this week. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office.\u201d",

      "Hatch Act violations are not typically referred to the Department of Justice. In 2019, the OSC recommended that then-President Trump remove White House counselor Kellyanne Conway from the federal workforce for Hatch Act violations \u2014 but the matter was not sent to the DOJ.",
      "The OSC investigation into Smith was first reported by the New York Post.",
      "Trump\u2019s nominee to head the OSC is stalled in the Senate. A White House official told NBC News that Paul Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of incendiary commentary, is meeting with senators in one-on-one meetings over the next month before a confirmation vote takes place."

She also noticed what she characterized as McGann\u2019s \u201cgrooming\u201d of girls in the classroom.",
      "\u201cMy kid would come home and say, \u2018Mr. McGann loves to play tag. He plays tag at recess every day with the girls,\u2019\u201d Polyak said, adding that her son told her McGann gave out candy and special prizes \u2014 but only to the girls.",
      "In a group chat with other fourth grade parents, Polyak said she learned that McGann arranged \u201cspecial lunches\u201d where certain girls would remain in his classroom; some parents alleged McGann encouraged girls to sit on his lap.",
      "Details about McGann\u2019s background as a teacher emerged after authorities arrested him in the fatal stabbings of a couple at Arkansas\u2019 Devil\u2019s Den State Park on July 26. Officials believe McGann, 28, fatally stabbed Clinton David Brink, 43, and his wife, Cristen Amanda Brink, 42, in front of their 7- and 9-year-old daughters.",
      "McGann\u2019s motive remains a mystery. Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters Thursday that officials have \u201cno reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspect and our victims.\u201d Arkansas authorities do not believe the Brinks\u2019 young daughters were the intended targets of what appears to have been a random attack.",
      "Polyak learned about McGann\u2019s arrest at a barbershop after a parent sent her a link to a news article. \u201cI was like, holy s---, this is McGann, this is the guy who was teaching my kid,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had no business being around our children.\u201d",
      "Megan Perkins, another parent whose child attended Donald Elementary, described McGann as \u201codd.\u201d She recalled that he was unnecessarily competitive with the kids during field day athletic contests. She said other parents would chat about his strange behavior, though not everyone was necessarily alarmed and some believed he was simply insecure as the new guy in the community.",
      "In a statement, the Lewisville Independent School District said McGann was \u201cplaced on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgement and student favoritism.\u201d The school district said an \u201cinternal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students.\u201d",
      "The Texas Education Agency said it had no record of state investigations into McGann, but placed a flag on his teaching certificate on Thursday following his arrest.",
      "McGann resigned from the school district in May 2023, Lewisville ISD said. He then moved back to Oklahoma, where he got a job as a fifth grade teacher at Spring Creek Elementary School in Oklahoma City for the 2023-24 school year.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, a woman whose son was in McGann\u2019s class at Spring Creek said he was \u201cpretty quiet, but all the kids loved him.\u201d",
      "The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about potential harassment, said her son admired his teacher and started wearing polo shirts to school \u201cbecause that\u2019s how Mr. McGann dressed.\u201d McGann expressed an interest in wrestling, hiking and the outdoors, and at one point he started a running club for the kids.",
      "She noticed that McGann was frequently \u201cawkward around the parents\u201d and \u201cstruggled to make eye contact during parent-teacher conferences.\u201d He once joked that he taught elementary school students because he was \u201cafraid of adults,\u201d she said.",

      "The district said there were \u201cno disciplinary actions taken against him during his time at Broken Arrow Public Schools, and nothing in his background or reference checks gave cause for concern during the interview process.\u201d",
      "McGann\u2019s next stop was Northwoods Fine Arts Academy in the Tulsa suburb of Sand Springs, where he worked during the 2024-25 school year. He again taught fifth grade and again \u201cresigned his position\u201d at the end of one academic year, Sand Springs Public Schools confirmed in a statement.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why McGann decided to relocate to Arkansas. But he had lined up another teaching job there, this time with Springdale Public Schools.",
      "On July 26, two weeks before the start of the school year, a hiker came across a grisly crime scene in Devil\u2019s Den State Park. The hiker found two girls alone on the trail, led them to safety, and then came across their parents, who had been stabbed to death, according to a preliminary report from the prosecutor\u2019s office for the state\u2019s 4th Judicial District.",
      "A man had been spotted leaving the trail with what appeared to be blood on his face before getting into a black sedan later determined to be a Kia Stinger, according to the report.",
      "The killings kicked off a manhunt that lasted four days before police tracked the Stinger to Springdale, where McGann was getting a haircut.",
      "The barber, Adriana Guadalupe Ruiz Avalos, said she got a strange feeling about him almost immediately.",
      "Ruiz Avalos said she tends to have a good read on the customers who stream into Lupita\u2019s, an unassuming family-owned beauty salon in the Arkansas town of Springdale. That\u2019s why her guard went up when a tense-faced 20-something in baggy khakis stepped into the salon on Wednesday afternoon and tersely asked for a high-fade haircut.",
      "Ruiz Avalos, 28, started snipping away but kept a close eye on her customer. She had been following news reports about the frantic search for the suspect in the Devil\u2019s Den killings. The man in front of her seemed timid, barely saying a word and keeping his head down.",
      "Roughly five minutes into the haircut, a law enforcement officer walked inside. He was looking for the driver of the car parked outside, and he had a few questions for Ruiz Avalos\u2019 quiet customer.",
      "Before long, McGann was handcuffed and taken away.",
      "Ruiz Avalos, who watches a lot of true-crime documentaries, made a point of keeping McGann\u2019s hair clippings on the floor in the event they could be useful to investigators hunting for DNA evidence. In the hours after his arrest, she had trouble calming down.",
      "\u201cI felt nauseous all night. I didn\u2019t fall asleep until 6 a.m. I was just thinking about them,\u201d Ruiz Avalos said, referring to the Brinks.",
      "The Brinks, like McGann, were recent transplants to Arkansas. They had moved to the state about three weeks ago, according to Clinton\u2019s sister, Katrina Hutchins.",
      "The family said Clinton and Cristen died \u201cprotecting their little girls.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey deserve justice,\u201d the family said in a brief statement.",

      "Here\u2019s what we know so far, and what remains unclear.",
      "How have the recommendations changed?",
      "What used to be straightforward is now much murkier. Last year, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccines were recommended for anyone at least 6 months old.",
      "This year, the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is narrower. Although the vaccines are broadly recommended for adults 19 and older, they are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people or for healthy children 6 months through 17 years old.",
      "Kennedy announced the changes in a video in May, citing safety risks for young people and pregnant people as justification.",
      "But his claims have been widely disputed by experts in vaccines, pediatrics, and women\u2019s health. An analysis by FactCheck.org found that the secretary \u201cmisrepresented scientific research to make unfounded claims about vaccine safety for pregnant people and children.\u201d",
      "In addition, recently announced changes to the vaccine approval framework have further chipped away at eligibility.",
      "Moderna announced July 10 that the Food and Drug Administration had fully approved its Spikevax Covid vaccine \u2014 but approval is restricted to adults 65 and older, and for people from 6 months through 64 years old who are at increased risk of developing a serious case of Covid.",
      "Two other Covid vaccines expected to be available this fall, Novavax\u2019s Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike, are also restricted. They are approved for people 65 or older and those 12 to 64 who have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of developing severe Covid.",
      "Notably, Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty Covid vaccine is still approved or authorized for people 6 months of age and older without any restrictions based on risk factors for Covid \u2014 at least for now. But the FDA could change that at any time, experts said.",
      "Increasing restrictions \u201cis definitely the direction they are moving,\u201d said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at KFF who authored a KFF analysis of vaccine insurance coverage rules. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "HHS did not provide an on-the-record comment for this article.",
      "How might these changes alter my insurance coverage for the vaccine?",
      "That\u2019s the big question, and the answer is uncertain. Without insurance coverage, people could owe hundreds of dollars for the shot.",
      "Most private health plans are required by law to cover recommended vaccines, whether for Covid, measles, or the flu, without charging their members. But that requirement kicks in after the shots are recommended by a federal panel \u2014 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 and adopted by the CDC director, according to the KFF analysis. The committee hasn\u2019t yet voted on Covid vaccine recommendations for this fall. Its next meeting is expected to occur in August or September.",
      "Still, employers and insurers can opt to cover the vaccines on their own, as many did before the law required them to do so. But they may require people to pay something for it.",
      "In addition, the narrower recommendations from different HHS agencies might result in some health plans declining to pay for certain categories of people to get certain vaccines, experts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think an employer or insurer would deny coverage,\u201d Kates said. \u201cBut they could say: You have to get this product.\u201d",
      "That could mean a 45-year-old with no underlying health conditions raising their covid risk might have to get the Pfizer shot rather than the Moderna version if they want their health plan to pay for it, experts said.",
      "In addition, up to 200 million people may qualify for the vaccines because they have health conditions such as asthma or diabetes that increase their risk of severe disease, according to a commentary published by FDA officials in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Health care professionals can help people determine whether they qualify for the shot based on health conditions.",
      "Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health plans, said in a statement that plans will continue to follow federal requirements for vaccine coverage.",
      "What are the options for people who are pregnant or have children they want to have vaccinated?",
      "Many parents are confused about getting their kids vaccinated, according to an Aug. 1 KFF poll. About half say they don\u2019t know whether federal agencies recommend healthy children get the vaccine this fall. Among the other half, more say the vaccine is not recommended than recommended.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy\u2019s recommendation that healthy children not get vaccinated has a notable caveat: If a parent wishes a child to get a Covid vaccine and a health care provider recommends it, the child can receive it under the \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d model, and it should be covered without cost sharing.",
      "Some policy experts point out that this is the way care for kids is typically provided anyway.",
      "\u201cOutside of any requirements, vaccines have always been provided through shared decision-making,\u201d said Amanda Jezek, senior vice president of public policy and government relations at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",
      "There\u2019s no similar allowance for pregnant people. However, even though Kennedy has stated that Covid vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people, pregnancy is one of the underlying medical conditions that put people at high risk for getting very sick from Covid, according to the CDC. That could make pregnant people eligible for the shot.",
      "Depending on the stage of someone\u2019s pregnancy, it could be difficult to know whether someone should be denied the shot based on their condition. \u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.",
      "How will these changes affect access to the vaccine? Will I still be able to go to the pharmacy for the shot?",
      "\u201cIf far fewer are expected to be vaccinated, fewer sites will offer the vaccinations,\u201d Levin-Scherz said. This could be an especially notable hurdle for people looking for pediatric doses of a covid vaccine, he said.",
      "In addition, pharmacists\u2019 authority to administer vaccines depends on several factors. For example, in some states they can administer shots that have been approved by the FDA, while in others the shots must have been recommended by the ACIP, said Hannah Fish, senior director of strategic initiatives at the National Community Pharmacists Association. Since ACIP hasn\u2019t yet recommended covid shots for the fall, that could create a speed bump in some states.",
      "\u201cDepending on the rules, you still may be able to get the shot at the pharmacy, but they might have to call the physician to send over a prescription,\u201d Fish said.",
      "What do these changes mean long-term?",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know. But given Kennedy\u2019s vocal skepticism of vaccines and his embrace of long-disproven theories about connections between vaccines and autism, among other things, medical and public health professionals are concerned those views will shape future policies.",
      "\u201cThe recommendation changes that were made with respect to children and pregnant women were not necessarily made in good science,\u201d Corlette said.",
      "It\u2019s already a challenge to convince people they need annual covid shots, and shifting guidelines may make it tougher, some public health experts warn.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning is that this could even further depress the uptake of the covid vaccines,\u201d Jezek said.",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism."

    "summary": "Brazilian products are subject to a 50% tariff not because of Brazil\u2019s trade policies, but because of Trump\u2019s relationship with Brazil's former president.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Products imported to the U.S. from Brazil \u2014 including almost a third of the supply relied on every day by America\u2019s coffee drinkers \u2014 are subject to a 50% tariff beginning Friday, not because of Brazil\u2019s trade policies, but because of President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with the country\u2019s former strongman president Jair Bolsonaro, and because of the actions of one of the justices of Brazil\u2019s supreme court.",
      "Trump typically justifies his tariffs by pointing to the U.S. trade deficit and saying that other nations are taking advantage of the United States. Many economists disagree with his view, but it doesn\u2019t matter in this instance: The U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Brazil of hundreds of billions of dollars over more than a decade, not a deficit.",
      "Still, on Friday, Trump imposed a total 50% tariff on certain products imported from Brazil, the highest rate of any country in the world.",
      "Earlier this week, the Trump administration also slapped the supreme court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, with tough sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, a law originally passed by Congress with the intent of punishing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies after the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, who had been investigating corruption in Russia. In a post on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the sanctions had been imposed \u201cfor serious human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "What are the alleged human rights abuses? De Moraes has been overseeing the case against Bolsonaro, who is charged along with some 30 others \u2014 including the former commander of Brazil\u2019s navy, the former defense minister and the former intelligence chief \u2014 with trying to stage a coup to prevent the current president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from taking office after he defeated Bolsonaro in a 2022 election.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Court has ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and not go on social media, call foreign leaders or leave the country pending his trial. Three Brazilian officials noted to NBC News that the penalty was imposed after one of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian congressman visiting the U.S., worked to enlist Steve Bannon and other MAGA allies to get Trump\u2019s attention and advocate to put pressure on Brazil over his father\u2019s case.",
      "De Moraes also ordered a ban in Brazil of the social media platform X, which is owned by sometime Trump ally Elon Musk, that lasted for more than a month last year after Musk and X refused to appoint a legal representative for their business in the country or to comply with court orders and requests to remove certain accounts and posts associated with election misinformation.",
      "And Trump\u2019s own social media company, Trump Media, has sued de Moraes over a suspension order he issued to the video hosting company Rumble, which Trump Media uses for its Truth Social platform.",
      "\u201cThe way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his Term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace. This Trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\u201d Trump said in a letter that he sent to Brazil\u2019s president, who is widely known as Lula, and posted to Truth Social on July 9.",
      "Trump\u2019s letter went on to tie Bolsonaro\u2019s prosecution and de Moraes\u2019 social media rulings to the tariffs he\u2019d later impose: \u201cDue in part to Brazil\u2019s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans (as lately illustrated by the Brazilian Supreme Court, which has issued hundreds of SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders to U.S. Social Media platforms, threatening them with Millions of Dollars in Fines and Eviction from the Brazilian Social Media market), starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge Brazil a Tariff of 50% on any and all Brazilian products sent into the United States.\u201d",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy, exports popular commodities like coffee, beef, oranges, aircraft, oil, iron and steel to the U.S. Trump\u2019s executive order excluded some products, including oranges, oil and fertilizers, but not coffee or beef.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions against Brazil have brought the country\u2019s opposing political sides together to some extent.",
      "A delegation including Bolsonaro supporters and a former opposition Cabinet member from Brazil\u2019s foreign relations and defense committee met in Washington this week with Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis to try to iron out the dispute.",
      "Brazil\u2019s foreign minister also flew to Washington to meet with Rubio on Wednesday. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick talked by phone with his Brazilian counterpart, two of the Brazilian officials told NBC News. They also said the call did not go well.",
      "Lula has not yet announced whether or how Brazil will retaliate against the U.S. tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court panel heard arguments on a challenge to Trump\u2019s authority to impose tariffs by executive order brought by businesses and a coalition of state attorneys general. Tariff opponents argue the White House has not established that a national emergency exists to justify Trump\u2019s circumventing what is, with some emergency exceptions, supposed to be congressional authority over tariffs.",
      "Several of the judges on the panel pressed the Justice Department lawyer representing the government on the president\u2019s right to impose steep duties using an economic emergency law that does not specifically mention tariffs. No other president has ever tried to impose tariffs under the 1977 law the Trump administration is citing. The case is expected to eventually end up at the Supreme Court."

      "Federal officials are investigating former special counsel Jack Smith after President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans have alleged that his investigations into then-candidate Trump amounted to illegal political activity.",
      "The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it's investigating Smith for alleged violations of the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits certain political activities by government officials. Trump and his allies have not presented specific evidence of wrongdoing.",
      "The OSC is different from the type of special counsel\u2019s office formerly headed by Smith, who was appointed by the Department of Justice. The independent agency lacks the authority to bring criminal charges and prosecute individuals who violate the Hatch Act, but it may seek disciplinary action for a federal government employee, such as removal from the civil workforce, or refer its findings of Hatch Act violations to the DOJ for investigation.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., requested that the OSC investigate Smith for \u201cunprecedented interference in the 2024 election.\u201d A source familiar with the matter says the OSC affirmed to Cotton that it is proceeding with its inquiry following his request.",
      "Smith was tapped as special counsel by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to oversee the federal investigations into Trump, who announced his candidacy for the presidency three days before Smith\u2019s appointment. Smith would go on to bring two criminal indictments against then-candidate Trump in 2023 but resigned just over one week before Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2024 \u2014 without ever having brought the two cases to trial.",
      "\u201cJack Smith\u2019s legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns,\u201d Cotton wrote on X this week. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office.\u201d",
      "Cotton, in part, alleges that Smith pushed for a \u201crushed trial\u201d of Trump. The Republican lawmaker has not publicly presented evidence that details how Smith\u2019s actions were illegal in nature.",
      "Hatch Act violations are not typically referred to the Department of Justice. In 2019, the OSC recommended that then-President Trump remove White House counselor Kellyanne Conway from the federal workforce for Hatch Act violations \u2014 but the matter was not sent to the DOJ.",
      "The OSC investigation into Smith was first reported by the New York Post.",
      "Trump\u2019s nominee to head the OSC is stalled in the Senate. A White House official told NBC News that Paul Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of incendiary commentary, is meeting with senators in one-on-one meetings over the next month before a confirmation vote takes place."

      "At the Sphere in Las Vegas, that sentiment was echoed by  thousands of Backstreet Boys concertgoers, many wearing all-white attire in homage to the band\u2019s \u201cMillennium\u201d album, singing along to hits like \u201cDrowning.\u201d Those who couldn\u2019t attend watched the concerts unfold on TikTok \u2014 where some videos have amassed millions of views.",
      "\u201cThis healed more of my childhood in 1.5 hours than any therapist has,\u201d one TikTok user wrote in the caption of their video from the show.",
      "\u201cI feel like I just time traveled,\u201d another creator wrote in the text of their video from the concert. \u201cAt the Sphere, listening to Backstreet Boys, wearing an all white 90s outfit, taking Jell-O shots.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, who went to the Backstreet Boys concert last weekend, described nostalgia as a \u201cconnective tissue that makes people feel less alone and less judgmental toward themselves, because other people like what they like, too.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re a more lonely and isolated generation as adults than we ever anticipated that we would be in our youth,\u201d she said, adding that millennials \u201cstraddle two very different eras in terms of technology and information.\u201d",
      "Generations \u201ccan be hard on each other online,\u201d Kennedy noted. But now, \u201cafter several years of being called cringe, or \u2018cheugy,\u2019 we millennials are leaning in.\u201d",
      "The longing for the millennial era has even crossed generational lines. Gen Zers, who once mocked millennial culture, are now romanticizing it. On TikTok, hundreds of users have recently posted tributes to all things millennial \u2014 from Tumblr and skinny jeans to upbeat music, Barack Obama and, perhaps most notably, HBO\u2019s TV series \u201cGirls.\u201d",
      "Perhaps sensing that enthusiasm, a string of early 2000s artists have stepped back into the spotlight. Nelly, Creed and The All-American Rejects \u2014 all staples of the late \u201890s and early aughts \u2014 have launched tours.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 brought her Destiny\u2019s Child bandmates Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland on stage for her final \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d show in Las Vegas last weekend, marking the group\u2019s first reunion in seven years.",
      "Hollywood is also jumping on the trend. Studios continue to green-light sequels, prequels and spinoffs based on beloved titles from the \u201890s and 2000s.",
      "Shots of Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt filming the sequel to the 2006 hit \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d  in New York City have caused a frenzy. Fans online are analyzing the actors\u2019 high-fashion looks and others are reportedly lining up to catch glimpses of the stars in person as they shoot, according to Variety.",
      "Adam Sandler\u2019s \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d which came out almost 30 years after the 1996 film, debuted to 46.7 million views on Netflix, making it the streamer\u2019s largest U.S. film opening ever."

      "Tariffs putting the squeeze on businesses and consumers while bringing in billions of dollars for the United States government. A job market that is showing major signs of cracking even as the unemployment rate remains subdued. Tech stocks surging on Wall Street, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 as many other sectors are ailing.",
      "As Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on social media earlier this week: \u201cthe Trump economy has officially arrived.\u201d",
      "The past week was already primed to be a doozy for data, with investors and analysts eagerly anticipating updates about economic growth, jobs and the Fed\u2019s latest interest rate decision. Major companies like Apple, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft reported their latest financial results. Trump\u2019s deadline for trade deals was set for Friday.",
      "But what happened this week turned out to be more extraordinary than anyone expected.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sending off red flares: We\u2019re on the precipice of a recession,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, a financial research company. \u201cIf tariffs keep increasing, I don\u2019t know how we avoid a recession.\u201d",
      "Coming into this week, the U.S. economy had generally been considered in good shape despite mounting uncertainty and concerns about slowing growth.",
      "The week kicked off in Scotland with the announcement of a deal with the European Union that would set tariffs at 15%, ending months of uncertainty surrounding the United States\u2019 largest trade partner.",
      "Trade talks then moved to Sweden, where leading officials from the U.S. and China held two days of negotiations. The talks yielded neither a deal nor a formal extension of the two countries\u2019 trade truce, which will expire Aug. 12.",
      "\u201cThe meetings were very constructive,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters after the talks wrapped up. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t given the sign-off.\u201d",
      "Given the importance of trade relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the cliffhanger meant the cloud of uncertainty created by Trump\u2019s tariffs gambit persisted, despite some deals having been struck with other major trading partners including the European Union and Japan.",
      "Tuesday offered little reason for renewed optimism, with the international shipping giant UPS again declining to issue financial forecasts for the rest of the year, prompting investor concern about the impact of Trump\u2019s shifting trade war and causing company shares to tank.",
      "Wednesday began with the Commerce Department reporting figures for second-quarter gross domestic product, or GDP, which measures economic growth in the U.S. The data showed an annual gain of 3%, beating expectations. But the same report also contained worrisome signs about business investment, even as price growth was accelerating.",
      "Later that day, the Federal Reserve announced it was keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, in part due to those inflation concerns. That drew the ire of Trump, who has spent weeks hounding Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower the key lending rate. In remarks following the central bank\u2019s announcement, Powell pointed to ongoing concerns about the potential for Trump\u2019s tariffs to raise prices for U.S. consumers \u2014 but critically, referred to the jobs market as \u201csolid.\u201d Notably, two members of the rate-setting board \u2014 both appointed by Trump \u2014 dissented, the first time that has occurred in more than three decades.",
      "Blowout earnings from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta \u2014 two companies at the center of the AI investment boom, which is a key part of Trump\u2019s domestic agenda \u2014 helped the stock market reach fresh highs early Thursday. Microsoft briefly became the second company to be worth more than $4 trillion on the stock market.",
      "Yet by the time the markets closed that day, stocks had erased their gains after Trump sent letters to more than a dozen pharmaceutical companies demanding they offer U.S. customers more competitive pricing for new medicines and giving them 60 days to comply.",
      "Late Thursday evening, Trump unveiled a sweeping new set of tariffs that unilaterally imposed higher import taxes on a host of trading partners, including allies like Canada and Taiwan. The new effective rate of more than 15% delivered a shock to global markets. The month closed with the Treasury Department reporting monthly tariff collections had hit another new record of more than $29 billion.",
      "In an interview with NBC News that evening, Trump touted the expansive new tariffs, saying he believed it all was going \u201cvery well, very smooth,\u201d even as he remained open to new deals.",
      "Then Friday\u2019s jobs report arrived.",
      "At 8:30 a.m., the Bureau of Labor Statistics published revisions showing sharply lower jobs totals for May and June than initially reported, while also finding the economy had added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. All told, it suggested the U.S. has gained an average of just 35,000 jobs a month over the past three months \u2014 and excluding the increases seen in the health care industry, the U.S. had lost more jobs than it had created.",
      "The unemployment rate, however, remained at 4.2%, a sign that overall joblessness remains subdued. However, many economists noted the data point is largely attributable to the president\u2019s immigration crackdown, which is shrinking the overall labor force.",
      "The White House hailed the loss of foreign-born workers as it also noted a more sustained increase in the labor force among native-born workers.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re swapping out foreign-born job holders for American-born job holders, I think that\u2019s a win,\u201d White House chief economic adviser Stephen Miran told Axios.",
      "He added that there was \u201creally good reason\u201d to believe the economy would improve, citing Trump\u2019s trade deals and tax cuts.",
      "But for Trump, the public\u2019s larger takeaway of a weakening labor market prompted an unprecedented response: Shortly after 2 p.m. ET on Friday, the president announced his intention to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over what he said were errors in the jobs data, as well as accusations the agency had \u201cmanipulated\u201d the numbers prior to the 2024 election. Neither allegation has been corroborated.",
      "The move sent shockwaves through Washington, with some experts warning it risked lowering the U.S. to the level of authoritarian regimes.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is once again destroying the credibility of our government by firing expert and nonpartisan officials because he does not like the facts that they present,\u201d said Max Stier, the CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. \u201cGovernments that go down this path find themselves in ugly territory very quickly.\u201d",
      "It was not clear whether the outgoing BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, a Biden administration appointee, would seek to challenge her removal in court. As it turns out, in addition to nominating a new head of the critical data agency, Trump will also get to name a new member to the Fed\u2019s rate-setting board after Adriana Kugler, another Joe Biden appointee, unexpectedly announced her resignation late Friday. Both nominees still must be confirmed by the Senate, which remains narrowly controlled by the GOP.",
      "Asked if the White House continued to harbor concerns about the direction of the economy, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, issued the following statement:",
      "\u201cIn his first term, President Trump used an America First economic agenda to deliver historic working class prosperity and the first reduction in wealth and income inequality in decades. In his [second] term, President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale \u2014 as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come.\u201d",
      "That view is not shared among other economists.",
      "\u201cAll of this is troubling: a weakening economy, slowing labor market, rising inflation, rising tariffs, political influence on a statistical agency, more political influence on Fed, tensions with Russia & the onset of a market correction,\u201d EY Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco wrote on X."

      "Weeks of rising anger over Palestinians starving due to Israel's offensive and aid restrictions had reached all the way to the White House, with President Donald Trump lamenting the sight of emaciated children on the brink of starvation.",
      "On Friday, his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, entered Gaza in a rare visit by high-level U.S. officials to the besieged enclave.",
      "Accompanied by the Israeli military, Witkoff visited an aid distribution site in southern Gaza run by the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, where hundreds of Palestinians waited desperately behind barbed wire for food.",
      "\u201cIncredible feat!\u201d Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, who accompanied Witkoff, said in a post on X on Friday, after touring GHF's operations and speaking to \"folks on the ground.\"",
      "Palestinians and others inside Gaza have criticized the visit as a public relations stunt for GHF, whose aid distribution process has been marked by chaos, looting and deadly shootings, often by Israeli soldiers, that have killed hundreds of hungry Palestinians seeking aid.",
      "\u201cIt was a PR stunt, a controlled visit supervised and dictated by the Israeli military,\u201d Ellie Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told the NBC News crew. \u201cWhat they saw was not the reality.\u201d",
      "Burgos had earlier called for Witkoff to visit Gaza, urging him to witness the conditions on the ground for himself, but felt his limited tour did little to change the situation on the ground.",
      "\u201cFood is still incredibly difficult to find, people are still being shot at aid distribution sites, and violence continues,\u201d she said.",
      "On the day of the visit, at least 92 people were killed on Friday across Gaza, including 51 people who were seeking aid, Dr. Mohammed Saqr, Director of Nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News.",
      "Mohamed Saddak, 47, who was hoping to collect food for his family of nine, told a NBC News' crew on the ground that tanks had advanced toward him and others as they sought to receive our aid.",
      "\u201cThey are constantly shooting at us,\u201d he said, \u201cfiring from tanks, and sometimes by drones.\u201d",
      "The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on the shootings at aid sites following Witkoff's visit.",
      "Israeli officials continued to deny claims of widespread hunger inside Gaza, though in a sign of shifting discourse, top U.S. officials have begun to acknowledge the crisis.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got little kids who are clearly starving to death,\u201d Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Monday.",
      "In a post on X, Witkoff said the visit's purpose was to give Trump a \"clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "After Gaza, Witkoff on Saturday visited Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where families of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas were demanding that the Israeli government secure a deal to release the remaining hostages. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "According to a statement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Witkoff told them, \u201cWe will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will do what\u2019s right for the Gazan people.\u201d",
      "The protests came after a video of an Israeli hostage in Gaza, Rom Braslavski, was released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad on Thursday. A day later, Hamas released a video of another Israeli hostage, Evyatar David, showing him alive but frail. It is unclear when the videos were filmed.",
      "\u201cWe cannot endure even one more minute without bringing him home,\u201d Braslavski\u2019s cousin Adam Hajaj said in a statement. \u201cThis video tore my family apart!\u201d",
      "Huckabee, meanwhile, hailed GHF's distribution of over a million meals a day, which at Gaza's population of roughly 2 million people, averages to half a meal per person per day.",
      "GHF stepped in to distribute food in the weeks after Israel lifted its nearly three-month total blockade on all food and supplies entering the enclave. But the aid GHF distributed, alongside some limited quantities by other international organizations, fell far short of the needs of the population. On Sunday, Israel said it was expanding aid access into Gaza after outrage mounted over the widespread starvation and surging deaths from malnutrition.",
      "GHF runs four aid sites in Gaza and even though it claims independence from any government, it runs the sites inside Israel's militarized zone with the backing of the Israeli military.",
      "Witnesses and aid agencies have decried the aid delivery process, which, according to the U.N., has resulted in deaths of nearly 1,400 people while collecting aid, including 859 in the vicinity of the GHF sites.",
      "The Israeli military and the GHF have acknowledged that some shots have been fired but said only as warnings.",
      "\u201cUS-backed Israeli forces and private contractors have put in place a flawed, militarized aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths,\u201d New York-based Human Rights Watch said Friday.",
      "Burgos's colleague, Dr. Tom Adamekiewicz, urged the diplomats to see \"what\u2019s happening to the children, the families, to these young boys and women and men that are being basically shot at like rabbits.\""

      "Two years before he was arrested in the killings of two Arkansas hikers, Andrew J. McGann was known to some parents at a Texas elementary school for his pattern of off-putting behavior around their kids.",
      "Lindsay Camp Polyak, whose son would spend some days in McGann\u2019s classroom at Donald Elementary School in the town of Flower Mound, said she and other parents grew concerned that he was not properly teaching their children and felt they were falling behind academically. She also noticed what she characterized as McGann\u2019s \u201cgrooming\u201d of girls in the classroom.",
      "\u201cMy kid would come home and say, \u2018Mr. McGann loves to play tag. He plays tag at recess every day with the girls,\u2019\u201d Polyak said, adding that her son told her McGann gave out candy and special prizes \u2014 but only to the girls.",
      "In a group chat with other fourth grade parents, Polyak said she learned that McGann arranged \u201cspecial lunches\u201d where certain girls would remain in his classroom; some parents alleged McGann encouraged girls to sit on his lap.",
      "Details about McGann\u2019s background as a teacher emerged after authorities arrested him in the fatal stabbings of a couple at Arkansas\u2019 Devil\u2019s Den State Park on July 26. Officials believe McGann, 28, fatally stabbed Clinton David Brink, 43, and his wife, Cristen Amanda Brink, 42, in front of their 7- and 9-year-old daughters.",
      "McGann\u2019s motive remains a mystery. Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters Thursday that officials have \u201cno reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspect and our victims.\u201d Arkansas authorities do not believe the Brinks\u2019 young daughters were the intended targets of what appears to have been a random attack.",
      "Polyak learned about McGann\u2019s arrest at a barbershop after a parent sent her a link to a news article. \u201cI was like, holy s---, this is McGann, this is the guy who was teaching my kid,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had no business being around our children.\u201d",
      "Megan Perkins, another parent whose child attended Donald Elementary, described McGann as \u201codd.\u201d She recalled that he was unnecessarily competitive with the kids during field day athletic contests. She said other parents would chat about his strange behavior, though not everyone was necessarily alarmed and some believed he was simply insecure as the new guy in the community.",
      "In a statement, the Lewisville Independent School District said McGann was \u201cplaced on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgement and student favoritism.\u201d The school district said an \u201cinternal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students.\u201d",
      "The Texas Education Agency said it had no record of state investigations into McGann, but placed a flag on his teaching certificate on Thursday following his arrest.",
      "McGann resigned from the school district in May 2023, Lewisville ISD said. He then moved back to Oklahoma, where he got a job as a fifth grade teacher at Spring Creek Elementary School in Oklahoma City for the 2023-24 school year.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, a woman whose son was in McGann\u2019s class at Spring Creek said he was \u201cpretty quiet, but all the kids loved him.\u201d",
      "The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about potential harassment, said her son admired his teacher and started wearing polo shirts to school \u201cbecause that\u2019s how Mr. McGann dressed.\u201d McGann expressed an interest in wrestling, hiking and the outdoors, and at one point he started a running club for the kids.",
      "She noticed that McGann was frequently \u201cawkward around the parents\u201d and \u201cstruggled to make eye contact during parent-teacher conferences.\u201d He once joked that he taught elementary school students because he was \u201cafraid of adults,\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement, Oklahoma\u2019s Broken Arrow Public Schools said McGann \u201cvoluntarily resigned at the end of that year to pursue employment elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The district said there were \u201cno disciplinary actions taken against him during his time at Broken Arrow Public Schools, and nothing in his background or reference checks gave cause for concern during the interview process.\u201d",
      "McGann\u2019s next stop was Northwoods Fine Arts Academy in the Tulsa suburb of Sand Springs, where he worked during the 2024-25 school year. He again taught fifth grade and again \u201cresigned his position\u201d at the end of one academic year, Sand Springs Public Schools confirmed in a statement.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why McGann decided to relocate to Arkansas. But he had lined up another teaching job there, this time with Springdale Public Schools.",
      "On July 26, two weeks before the start of the school year, a hiker came across a grisly crime scene in Devil\u2019s Den State Park. The hiker found two girls alone on the trail, led them to safety, and then came across their parents, who had been stabbed to death, according to a preliminary report from the prosecutor\u2019s office for the state\u2019s 4th Judicial District.",
      "A man had been spotted leaving the trail with what appeared to be blood on his face before getting into a black sedan later determined to be a Kia Stinger, according to the report.",
      "The killings kicked off a manhunt that lasted four days before police tracked the Stinger to Springdale, where McGann was getting a haircut.",
      "The barber, Adriana Guadalupe Ruiz Avalos, said she got a strange feeling about him almost immediately.",
      "Ruiz Avalos said she tends to have a good read on the customers who stream into Lupita\u2019s, an unassuming family-owned beauty salon in the Arkansas town of Springdale. That\u2019s why her guard went up when a tense-faced 20-something in baggy khakis stepped into the salon on Wednesday afternoon and tersely asked for a high-fade haircut.",
      "Ruiz Avalos, 28, started snipping away but kept a close eye on her customer. She had been following news reports about the frantic search for the suspect in the Devil\u2019s Den killings. The man in front of her seemed timid, barely saying a word and keeping his head down.",
      "Roughly five minutes into the haircut, a law enforcement officer walked inside. He was looking for the driver of the car parked outside, and he had a few questions for Ruiz Avalos\u2019 quiet customer.",
      "Before long, McGann was handcuffed and taken away.",
      "Ruiz Avalos, who watches a lot of true-crime documentaries, made a point of keeping McGann\u2019s hair clippings on the floor in the event they could be useful to investigators hunting for DNA evidence. In the hours after his arrest, she had trouble calming down.",
      "\u201cI felt nauseous all night. I didn\u2019t fall asleep until 6 a.m. I was just thinking about them,\u201d Ruiz Avalos said, referring to the Brinks.",
      "The Brinks, like McGann, were recent transplants to Arkansas. They had moved to the state about three weeks ago, according to Clinton\u2019s sister, Katrina Hutchins.",
      "The family said Clinton and Cristen died \u201cprotecting their little girls.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey deserve justice,\u201d the family said in a brief statement.",
      "McGann has been booked on charges of capital murder, jail records show. Authorities said that McGann\u2019s DNA matched that found at the scene. He made statements to investigators \u201cindicating that he had committed these heinous acts.\u201d"

      "Across the economy, hiring in recent months has ground to its slowest pace since the start of the pandemic, with employers adding just 73,000 jobs in July, according to data released Friday. The number of longer-term unemployed people who have been out of work for more than 27 weeks increased last month by 179,000 to 1.8 million.",
      "In short, it\u2019s a pretty stable market for those who have a job, but a much more challenging one for those who are trying to get one, economists said.",
      "Driving that trend is hesitation among employers to hire new workers amid wider economic uncertainty in the midst of President Donald Trump\u2019s shifting tariff policies and federal spending cuts, economists have said. Then there is the emergence of AI, which some companies have said they are using to replace certain entry-level jobs, like those in customer support or basic software development.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be an environment for recent college grads, as well as many workers, which is going to require more patience, more time and perhaps more diligence as they seek to attain employment,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst for Bankrate.",
      "Here is how several recent graduates described their job search:",
      "23",
      "Atlanta",
      "Bachelor\u2019s degree, computer science",
      "Unemployed",
      "Adam Mitchell thought he was doing everything right. He majored in computer science at Georgia State University and interned at State Farm doing web development. He\u2019d been told since he was a teenager that a degree in computer science was a guaranteed path to a high-paying job right out of college.",
      "\u201cI was under the impression that since I\u2019ve got three years of internship experience under my belt, this will be a cakewalk,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI was pretty quickly humbled. There\u2019s nothing available.\u201d",
      "More than seven months after graduating, he\u2019s applied for more than 100 jobs and gotten two interviews and only one job offer \u2014 for the 4 a.m. shift at Starbucks, which he didn\u2019t take because the hours would make it too hard to pursue other opportunities. Among the jobs that turned him down: an hourly role at Costco and a customer service job in the call center at State Farm.",
      "\u201cThe very few openings that there were would be so competitive that you would pretty much get a rejection notice as soon as you apply,\u201d said Mitchell, who\u2019s been living at home with his parents in the Atlanta area and spending down his savings.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t be doing this forever, just waiting for the dust to settle and things to kind of normalize again \u2014 I need a job,\u201d said Mitchell, who worries about paying back his student loans.",
      "Tech workers have been some of the hardest hit in a slowing job market, with more than 400 employers including Meta, Intel and Cisco announcing more than 130,000 jobs cut in 2025, according to tech job site TrueUp.",
      "Those cuts mark a retrenchment after the hiring spree those companies went on after the pandemic, while an abundance of workers are vying for the remaining jobs, said Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. Early adoption of AI is also likely driving some of the cuts and leading employers to rethink hiring plans in anticipation of AI\u2019s future role, Shrivastava said. Mitchell worries that could hurt his prospects long term, so he isn\u2019t limiting his search to tech jobs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just kind of looking for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the tech-side economy is ever going to be the same again.\u201d",
      "26",
      "Emporia, Kansas",
      "Associate\u2019s degree, power plant management",
      "Unemployed",
      "After Anthony Young graduated last year from Flint Hills Technical College in Emporia, Kansas, he planned to use the degree to get a job at a nearby nuclear power plant where his wife also works. But after more than a year, he hasn\u2019t succeeded.",
      "\u201cIt is essentially a useless degree,\u201d Young said. \u201cI wasted two years of my life, and I can\u2019t do anything with it.\u201d",
      "Looking for work beyond the power plant industry has also been a struggle, as other employers in Emporia, about an hour from Wichita, have been cutting jobs. Tyson closed a meat processing plant there at the start of the year, eliminating over 800 jobs, and the Michelin tire company cut 80 jobs last year, nearly 40% of its workforce. The town had an unemployment rate of 5.8% in June, when not adjusted for seasonal employment, which was the highest in the state, where the overall unemployment rate was 4.1%, according to the state\u2019s Department of Labor.",
      "Young recently went back to school to get a technical certificate to work as a household electrician. But when he started looking for a job, he learned that he would need to go through a five-year apprenticeship program with the local electrical workers union and travel up to two hours away for work, which would be a financial strain because he and his wife only have one car.",
      "\u201cI just have to figure out a way to get a car and make peace with the fact that there\u2019s a chance I may be put somewhere really far from home and I never get to see my family very much for five years, but I don\u2019t know what else to do really,\u201d Young said.",
      "His wife makes more than $90,000 a year \u2014 a salary he would have thought would be enough in a small town in Kansas. But not anymore, he said. An apartment that would have cost $600 a month in 2019 is now $1,000. His weekly trip to the grocery store has gone from costing $80 to $180. Then there are his $20,000 in student loans, and the rising cost of insurance, gas and utilities.",
      "\u201cWe still live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d he said, \u201cand we shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "25",
      "Snyder, Texas",
      "Master\u2019s degree, design with a focus on user experience",
      "Eligibility adviser for SNAP and Medicaid benefits",
      "Sabrina Highfield, 25, was making more than $70,000 a year as a project manager and analyst before she returned to school in 2024 in hopes of boosting her salary. But since she graduated in the spring from the University of Texas at Austin with a master\u2019s, the opposite has happened.",
      "After applying to more than 1,000 jobs and getting only two interviews, she\u2019s living back in her hometown of Snyder, Texas, with her grandmother, making $35,000 a year working in an entry-level position helping administer food assistance benefits \u2014 something unrelated to her field of study and a job she suspects she got, in part, because the hiring manager knew her grandmother.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a black hole out there,\u201d she said on a recent morning when she was babysitting her sister\u2019s two children. \u201cI\u2019ve tailored my resume based on the job posts, I\u2019ve created cover letters for each role as well, based on the company\u2019s values and everything. I would say it\u2019s a little discouraging. I did find a job, though it\u2019s not at all in the industry that I thought I\u2019d be in.\u201d",
      "She hopes to move up to a more senior position with her current employer, Texas Health and Human Services, but so far she\u2019s had no luck.",
      "It\u2019s a vastly different job market than several years ago, which she doesn\u2019t think the recent economic data is capturing.",
      "\u201cThings look good on the surface, I guess, but when you dig a little deeper, it\u2019s concerning for Gen Z,\u201d she said.",
      "22",
      "Miami",
      "Bachelor\u2019s degree, operations and information management",
      "Unemployed, starting his own business",
      "After applying to hundreds of positions, working his friend and family connections and reaching out to his school\u2019s alumni network, Oliver Dolabany has landed just one interview and zero job offers over the past six months. Like most of his classmates, he\u2019s back home living with his parents.",
      "Getting a job feels more like luck than anything having to do with his major or academic qualifications. When a job is posted on LinkedIn, he said he can see it has received more than 100 resumes in the first hour. The one interview he got came through an alumni connection who knew the CEO of the company and put in a good word. But even then, he didn\u2019t get the position.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily even like being more qualified than the guy next to you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like just getting luckier than the guy next to you.\u201d",
      "While at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Dolabany worked as a teaching assistant, overseeing 500 students a semester, got A\u2019s in nearly all of his classes, and chose a major \u2014 operations and information management \u2014 that he believed would set him up for success.",
      "\u201cIt was kind of presented to me as, this is the major that every company needs, every company wants,\u201d Dolbany said. \u201cIt was presented as, you\u2019re pretty safe compared to all the other majors at the school.\u201d",
      "He plans to launch a skin care business with a friend while applying for jobs and living with his parents. He still hopes to find a job in New York City and move into a place of his own.",
      "22",
      "Durham, North Carolina",

      "Clinical researcher",
      "Jaylah Dorman landed a job doing clinical research at a private physician\u2019s practice in her hometown of Durham, North Carolina, shortly after graduating from Howard University \u2014 a success she attributes to her strong professional network and her degree in a high-demand field.",
      "Hiring in the health care sector has been driving much of the job growth nationally, with around half of the 2.2 million jobs added to the economy last year in health care-related sectors, according to an analysis by S&P Global.",
      "Still, she has a negative view of the job market overall and has seen a lot of her peers go to graduate school rather than head straight into the workforce.",
      "\u201cA lot of adults have confirmed that this is one of the worst times to come out of college,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is the narrative that is being confirmed by people who\u2019ve been in the job market.\u201d",
      "Dorman, who hopes to go to medical school, is also concerned about the sweeping tax cut and spending bill passed by Congress in July, which will cap how much students can borrow for graduate and professional programs.",
      "The Trump administration has also been cutting research spending and public health jobs. Dorman had considered trying to get a job at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but ruled that out as the administration started firing workers.",
      "26",
      "Summit, Illinois",
      "Bachelor\u2019s degree, education",
      "Elementary school teacher",
      "Saida Lopez-Rosales considers herself one of the lucky ones. She was able to get an elementary school teaching job in a suburb of Chicago after graduating in June when a position suddenly opened up at the school where she was student teaching. But she said she\u2019s seen her classmates at National Louis University in Chicago struggle despite a national shortage of teachers.",
      "Last year, there were more than 400,000 teaching jobs that went unfilled or were filled by teachers not fully certified for their position, according to the Learning Policy Institute. But that shortage can vary by school district and teaching discipline. There are also indications that shortages are easing in Illinois, where Lopez-Rosales and her classmates have been looking.",
      "Lopez-Rosales is expecting the local teaching job market to get increasingly competitive after Chicago Public Schools announced in July it was laying off around 1,400 employees, including around 400 teachers.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in school, everyone was like, \u2018You\u2019ll get a job right after graduation, you\u2019ll get a job.\u2019 That\u2019s how they were selling it,\u201d said Lopez-Rosales, who decided to go into education because she had heard there was a teacher shortage. \u201cLuckily, that\u2019s how I got it, but I have a friend who\u2019s still looking.\u201d",
      "Lopez-Rosales isn\u2019t particularly optimistic about the economy or her financial outlook. She will be making $55,000 \u2014 a higher salary than other teaching positions she\u2019d looked at. But with rent in the area costing well over $1,000 a month, she won\u2019t be able to afford to move out of her parents\u2019 house.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more like a paycheck-to-paycheck kind of thing, because you do have to pay bills and feed yourself,\u201d Lopez-Rosales said.",
      "While she said she\u2019s content living with her parents, it isn\u2019t what she envisioned for herself in her mid-20s.",
      "\u201cI told myself, by 26, I\u2019d have my own house, I\u2019d have my own family, I\u2019d have my nice little luxury car. That hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Lopez-Rosales said. \u201cAt first, I did kind of beat myself up for it, but it\u2019s like the world\u2019s changing. Everything\u2019s changing. Everything I feel like is a little bit harder. So now it\u2019s OK.\u201d"

    "summary": "If you want a Covid shot this fall, will your employer\u2019s health insurance plan pay for it?",
    "story": [
      "If you want a Covid shot this fall, will your employer\u2019s health insurance plan pay for it? There\u2019s no clear answer.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has upended the way Covid vaccines are approved and for whom they\u2019re recommended, creating uncertainty where coverage was routine.",
      "Agencies within HHS responsible for spelling out who should get vaccinated aren\u2019t necessarily in sync, issuing seemingly contradictory recommendations based on age or risk factors for serious disease.",
      "But the ambiguity may not affect your coverage, at least this year.",
      "\u201cI think in 2025 it\u2019s highly likely that the employer plans will cover\u201d the Covid vaccines, said Dr. Jeff Levin-Scherz, a primary care doctor who is the population health leader for the management consultancy WTW and an assistant professor at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. They\u2019ve already budgeted for it, \u201cand it would be a large administrative effort to try to exclude coverage for those not at increased risk,\u201d he said.",
      "With so much in flux, it\u2019s important to check with your employer or insurer about coverage policies before you roll up your sleeve.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know so far, and what remains unclear.",
      "How have the recommendations changed?",
      "What used to be straightforward is now much murkier. Last year, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccines were recommended for anyone at least 6 months old.",
      "This year, the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is narrower. Although the vaccines are broadly recommended for adults 19 and older, they are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people or for healthy children 6 months through 17 years old.",
      "Kennedy announced the changes in a video in May, citing safety risks for young people and pregnant people as justification.",
      "But his claims have been widely disputed by experts in vaccines, pediatrics, and women\u2019s health. An analysis by FactCheck.org found that the secretary \u201cmisrepresented scientific research to make unfounded claims about vaccine safety for pregnant people and children.\u201d",
      "In addition, recently announced changes to the vaccine approval framework have further chipped away at eligibility.",
      "Moderna announced July 10 that the Food and Drug Administration had fully approved its Spikevax Covid vaccine \u2014 but approval is restricted to adults 65 and older, and for people from 6 months through 64 years old who are at increased risk of developing a serious case of Covid.",
      "Two other Covid vaccines expected to be available this fall, Novavax\u2019s Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike, are also restricted. They are approved for people 65 or older and those 12 to 64 who have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of developing severe Covid.",
      "Notably, Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty Covid vaccine is still approved or authorized for people 6 months of age and older without any restrictions based on risk factors for Covid \u2014 at least for now. But the FDA could change that at any time, experts said.",
      "Increasing restrictions \u201cis definitely the direction they are moving,\u201d said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at KFF who authored a KFF analysis of vaccine insurance coverage rules. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "HHS did not provide an on-the-record comment for this article.",
      "How might these changes alter my insurance coverage for the vaccine?",
      "That\u2019s the big question, and the answer is uncertain. Without insurance coverage, people could owe hundreds of dollars for the shot.",
      "Most private health plans are required by law to cover recommended vaccines, whether for Covid, measles, or the flu, without charging their members. But that requirement kicks in after the shots are recommended by a federal panel \u2014 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 and adopted by the CDC director, according to the KFF analysis. The committee hasn\u2019t yet voted on Covid vaccine recommendations for this fall. Its next meeting is expected to occur in August or September.",
      "Still, employers and insurers can opt to cover the vaccines on their own, as many did before the law required them to do so. But they may require people to pay something for it.",
      "In addition, the narrower recommendations from different HHS agencies might result in some health plans declining to pay for certain categories of people to get certain vaccines, experts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think an employer or insurer would deny coverage,\u201d Kates said. \u201cBut they could say: You have to get this product.\u201d",
      "That could mean a 45-year-old with no underlying health conditions raising their covid risk might have to get the Pfizer shot rather than the Moderna version if they want their health plan to pay for it, experts said.",
      "In addition, up to 200 million people may qualify for the vaccines because they have health conditions such as asthma or diabetes that increase their risk of severe disease, according to a commentary published by FDA officials in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Health care professionals can help people determine whether they qualify for the shot based on health conditions.",
      "Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health plans, said in a statement that plans will continue to follow federal requirements for vaccine coverage.",
      "What are the options for people who are pregnant or have children they want to have vaccinated?",
      "Many parents are confused about getting their kids vaccinated, according to an Aug. 1 KFF poll. About half say they don\u2019t know whether federal agencies recommend healthy children get the vaccine this fall. Among the other half, more say the vaccine is not recommended than recommended.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy\u2019s recommendation that healthy children not get vaccinated has a notable caveat: If a parent wishes a child to get a Covid vaccine and a health care provider recommends it, the child can receive it under the \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d model, and it should be covered without cost sharing.",
      "Some policy experts point out that this is the way care for kids is typically provided anyway.",
      "\u201cOutside of any requirements, vaccines have always been provided through shared decision-making,\u201d said Amanda Jezek, senior vice president of public policy and government relations at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",
      "There\u2019s no similar allowance for pregnant people. However, even though Kennedy has stated that Covid vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people, pregnancy is one of the underlying medical conditions that put people at high risk for getting very sick from Covid, according to the CDC. That could make pregnant people eligible for the shot.",
      "Depending on the stage of someone\u2019s pregnancy, it could be difficult to know whether someone should be denied the shot based on their condition. \u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.",
      "How will these changes affect access to the vaccine? Will I still be able to go to the pharmacy for the shot?",
      "\u201cIf far fewer are expected to be vaccinated, fewer sites will offer the vaccinations,\u201d Levin-Scherz said. This could be an especially notable hurdle for people looking for pediatric doses of a covid vaccine, he said.",
      "In addition, pharmacists\u2019 authority to administer vaccines depends on several factors. For example, in some states they can administer shots that have been approved by the FDA, while in others the shots must have been recommended by the ACIP, said Hannah Fish, senior director of strategic initiatives at the National Community Pharmacists Association. Since ACIP hasn\u2019t yet recommended covid shots for the fall, that could create a speed bump in some states.",
      "\u201cDepending on the rules, you still may be able to get the shot at the pharmacy, but they might have to call the physician to send over a prescription,\u201d Fish said.",
      "What do these changes mean long-term?",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know. But given Kennedy\u2019s vocal skepticism of vaccines and his embrace of long-disproven theories about connections between vaccines and autism, among other things, medical and public health professionals are concerned those views will shape future policies.",
      "\u201cThe recommendation changes that were made with respect to children and pregnant women were not necessarily made in good science,\u201d Corlette said.",
      "It\u2019s already a challenge to convince people they need annual covid shots, and shifting guidelines may make it tougher, some public health experts warn.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning is that this could even further depress the uptake of the covid vaccines,\u201d Jezek said.",

    "story": [
      "Before New York City mayoral primary winner Zohran Mamdani made a splash, another big-city Democratic mayoral candidate with progressive bona fides unexpectedly burst onto the national political scene.",
      "Two years later, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s tenure has captured so much negative attention (dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Worst Mayor\u201d by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board) that Mamdani\u2019s campaign has taken note. Mamdani\u2019s camp is tracking Johnson\u2019s challenges and trying to avoid repeating Second City missteps, according to a person close to both Mamdani\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s teams.",
      "Johnson isn\u2019t the only progressive major-city mayor in the country, and his troubles wouldn\u2019t automatically translate to ideological allies. Mamdani himself has \u201crepeatedly cited\u201d another progressive mayor as a role model, as The Boston Globe noted: Boston Mayor Michelle Wu.",
      "But Johnson\u2019s tenure in Chicago does serve as a useful early warning system for some of the issues Mamdani could confront in New York, whether in a multiway general election or as mayor, if he wins in November. Chicago Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor, a strong campaign ally who has also criticized some of the mayor\u2019s early decisions, noted how critics often trot out the word \u201csocialism\u201d to cast blame on Johnson for long-standing issues facing the city. It\u2019s a phenomenon, she added, that Mamdani could similarly face.",
      "\u201cPeople make this a bad word. People make this into something that it is not. Let\u2019s just call all of this what it is: This is the way the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, because they get us fighting on s--- that just does not even matter,\u201d she said.",
      "Johnson was a county commissioner, schoolteacher and union organizer when he leapfrogged far more battle-tested candidates to clinch the city\u2019s mayoralty. While Mamdani knocked out former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in New York City, before Cuomo began a third-party run, Johnson eliminated incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot from contention with his rise.",
      "Johnson, who does not call himself a democratic socialist but believes in many of the same principles as Mamdani, was swept into office by a coalition underpinned by the powerful Chicago Teachers Union and the city\u2019s Black and brown voters. He vowed to unite fractured coalitions and lift up the most vulnerable. He represented change, and his strong roots in the community as an activist, a parent and a resident of a neighborhood that struggles with crime gave hope around new efforts toward equality across a city long deeply segregated by race and income.",
      "The young, energetic activist with a passion for fighting wealth inequality and lifting up the city\u2019s left-behind neighborhoods entered office with much promise. But it hasn\u2019t gone well since then.",
      "\u201cThey lost the plot,\u201d the person close to both Mamdani\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s teams said of Johnson\u2019s tenure. The person noted that while both Johnson and Mamdani have specific visions, they said Mamdani is \u201cpragmatic and he wants to succeed\u201d but described Johnson as unbending at times.",
      "One of the most significant missteps, the person said, was whom Johnson brought into his administration, adding: \u201cStaffing is very important. You need professionals who can execute your vision. Those may not be the same people who ran your campaign.\u201d",
      "One of Mamdani\u2019s recent communications hires comes with deep experience. Dora Pekec, who once served as a campaign manager for Chicago Alderman Bill Conway, also worked with House Majority PAC before heading communications for Brad Lander in his New York mayoral run. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio also recently suggested staffers under his administration would be ripe for picking.",
      "It was a point that Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, D-Ill., also underscored. Garcia was among those who lost in the first round of Chicago\u2019s 2023 mayoral election.",
      "\u201cWhen progressives run for high office it\u2019s critical to be ready to govern,\u201d Garcia wrote in a text message. \u201cGoverning entails striking a balance between promises made (ideals) and making the wheels of government turn. Need to assemble a team that understands your priorities and deliver services, keep relationships with stakeholders especially a base while expanding through engagement. Intergovernmental relationships need to be really keen.\u201d",
      "\u201cExperience in developing and executing plans is most important. This applies to Johnson and when Mamdani is elected,\u201d he continued.",
      "Agendas and obstacles",
      "While attempting to make headway on his agenda, Johnson was confronted with a rash of challenges facing Chicago, and his popularity began to slide. With some exceptions, observers say it was less about Johnson pushing far-left policies and more about the mayor\u2019s confrontational style, his struggles to communicate and his inability to forge alliances with state and federal officials.",
      "Even as he made headway in the areas of public safety and mental health, Johnson grew entrenched in battles big and small, cultivating an air of drama over his City Hall.",
      "While Johnson eschewed criticism during his campaign that he would be owned by the teachers union, those concerns persisted. He did hammer out a teachers contract without a disruption to the school year \u2014 no small feat \u2014 but it proved to be a bad-tempered and messy ordeal that could bring lasting political reprisal. He went to war with and fired a popular schools CEO, and also saw the resignations of the entire board of education, which Johnson had appointed.",
      "Johnson almost immediately saw his coalition splinter over an influx of migrants whom Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused into Chicago without warning. Like other major cities at the time, Chicago grappled with how to adequately house families vying for legal status. The city clashed with its own residents, including in neighborhoods of color, with much of the political backlash affecting Johnson.",
      "He and Gov. JB Pritzker, a fellow Democrat, share a frosty relationship at best. He locked horns with his city council over major policy decisions. He broke a campaign promise by seeking a $300 million property tax increase then suffered the humiliation of a 50-0 council defeat.",
      "William Daley, the son of longtime Mayor Richard J. Daley and brother of longtime Mayor Richard M. Daley, said Johnson\u2019s troubles at least partially stem from lacking experience in managing an expansive budget and overseeing tens of thousands of employees. He predicted that, if elected, the 33-year-old Mamdani could face similar political troubles as Johnson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tough job if you\u2019ve never been in politics or in a job that manages something big,\u201d Daley said, noting his brother\u2019s prior experience before his mayorship. \u201cRich had eight years as state\u2019s attorney. \u2026 He had that experience for eight years \u2014 running something. It\u2019s not an easy task for these people who have never run anything.\u201d",
      "Johnson\u2019s predecessors had their own shortcomings, from public corruption to massive civil rights failures, relentless crime and poor fiscal management that still haunts the city today. In 2008, then-Mayor Richard M. Daley sold the city\u2019s parking meters to private investors for a staggering 75 years, trading billions of dollars in future revenue to plug a budget hole for a one-time payment.",
      "Taylor, the Chicago City Council member, said that while Johnson \u201cmade some rookie mistakes\u201d he is unfairly getting the brunt of the blame for mistakes shared by predecessors.",
      "\u201cYou think in 22 months we have dug a $1.5 billion hole?\u201d she said of those blaming Johnson. \u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing.\u201d",
      "New beginnings",
      "Politically, things have potential to look up for Johnson. Trump has sicced his Department of Justice on the mayor to investigate his hiring practices after Johnson had discussed hiring Black individuals for key positions. Johnson fired back that his hiring reflected the country and the city, while Trump\u2019s hiring reflected a \u201ccountry club.\u201d",
      "It caught on in conservative circles, with cable news hosts bashing Johnson just as they had done with Lightfoot. In an interview, she said Mamdani could expect the same.",
      "Lightfoot often hit back, and that brought its own repercussions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fight against the guy who\u2019s got the biggest megaphone in the world,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cMany of us who were Black women, like me in Chicago, like Muriel Bowser in D.C., like Keisha Lance Bottoms in Atlanta, when he mentioned us by name in a disparaging way, candidly, the death threats went through the roof.\u201d",
      "Moving into the second half of his term, Johnson can point to public safety as one of his biggest achievements. Observers largely applaud his choice of Superintendent Larry Snelling to lead the police department, as well as policies the mayor has put into place, like boosting mental health services, restructuring the detectives bureau and backing violence intervention methods.",
      "The number of murders in the city has fallen for two consecutive years, and Chicago could be on pace to reach the mayor\u2019s goal of having fewer than 500 homicides this year for the first time in a decade.",
      "\u201cMayor Johnson\u2019s primary focus over his first two years in office has been on driving down violent crime in Chicago. Since taking office, Chicago has seen historic reductions in crime and violence under the Johnson administration\u2019s holistic approach,\u201d a spokesperson from Johnson\u2019s office said in a statement, citing a 33% drop in homicides in the first six months of 2025 and a 38% drop in shootings in that same period. It also boasted of having the highest homicide clearance rate in more than a decade.",
      "As far as Johnson\u2019s poll numbers, \u201cthe narrative that Mayor Johnson is unpopular has been constructed by a small number of well-funded political organizations opposed to the Mayor\u2019s progressive agenda,\u201d the statement said."

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014\u00a0An appeals court on Friday kept in place a Los Angeles federal judge's ruling that bars immigration agents from using a person's spoken language or job, like day laborer, as the sole pretext to detain them.",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in its ruling said that there seemed to be one issue with U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's temporary restraining order, but it did not put it on hold as the government sought.",
      "The appeals court said that a part of the July 11 temporary restraining order referring to \"except as permitted by law\" was too vague.",
      "\"Defendants, however, are not likely to succeed on their remaining arguments,\" the court ruled, referring to the U.S. government.",
      "Frimpong, a judge at the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, issued the temporary restraining order after a lawsuit was filed by people who claimed they were detained by immigration officers without good reason.",
      "Three people were waiting at a bus stop for jobs when they were detained by immigration officials, and two others are U.S. citizens who claim they were stopped and aggressively questioned despite telling agents they were citizens. Other organizations, including the United Farm Workers, also sued.",
      "Frimpong wrote in the temporary restraining order ruling that the people suing were \u201clikely to succeed in proving that the federal government is indeed conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.\u201d",
      "The July 11 restraining order bars the detention of people unless the officer or agent \u201chas reasonable suspicion that the person to be stopped is within the United States in violation of U.S. immigration law.\u201d",
      "It says they may not base that suspicion solely on a person\u2019s apparent race or ethnicity; the fact that they\u2019re speaking Spanish or English with an accent; their presence at a particular location like a bus stop or a day laborer pickup site; or the type of work one does.",
      "Los Angeles has been targeted by the Trump administration for immigration raids that the city's mayor has decried as a campaign to terrorize residents.",
      "The lawsuit that led to the temporary restraining order was filed against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and others.",
      "Kyle Harvick, the deputy incident commander for the government's immigration action in Los Angeles, said that \"certain types of businesses, including carwashes\" were chosen by immigration agents \"because past experiences have demonstrated that illegal aliens utilize and seek work at these locations,\" according to the appeals court ruling.",
      "The appeals court found that \"the four enumerated factors at issue \u2014 apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together \u2014 describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop.'\"",
      "The appeals court panel said that the government did not dispute constitutional issues when trying to get the temporary restraining order stayed.",
      "\u201cThey did not meaningfully dispute the district court\u2019s conclusion that sole reliance on the four enumerated factors, alone or in combination, does not satisfy the constitutional requirement of reasonable suspicion,\u201d the appeals court panel wrote.",
      "Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation at Public Counsel, which is among the groups representing the people who sued, said Friday that the actions by immigration agents in the Los Angeles operation were unconstitutional.",
      "\"Today\u2019s ruling sends a powerful message: the government cannot excuse illegal conduct by relying on racial profiling as a tool of immigration enforcement,\" Rosenbaum said. \"These raids were unconstitutional, unsupported by evidence, and rooted in fear and harmful stereotypes, not public safety.\"",
      "The appeals court did find that part of Frimpong\u2019s temporary order was vague, relating to \"except as permitted by law\" in the clause about detaining people based on the four factors of race, speaking Spanish, a location or type of work. But it otherwise denied the government's motion for a stay.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, called the appeals court ruling a victory.",
      "\"Today is a victory for the rule of law and for the City of Los Angeles,\" she said in a statement. \"The Temporary Restraining Order that has been protecting our communities from immigration agents using racial profiling and other illegal tactics when conducting their cruel and aggressive enforcement raids and sweeps will remain in place for now.\"",
      "The immigration raids launched in Los Angeles in June resulted in large protests in the city, some of which turned violent. The Trump administration sent National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in a move that was condemned by Bass, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and others.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday about the appeals court ruling."

      "A six-year-old boy was hurt when an octopus grabbed on to his arm and wouldn't let go after the boy reached into a touch tank at the San Antonio Aquarium, his mother said.",
      "Britney Taryn, the boy's mom, has gone viral on TikTok after posting about her son's encounter with a giant Pacific octopus on a July 14 visit. The sea creature attached itself to her son Leo\u2019s arm, she said, noting that they go often and have touched the animal plenty of times before.",
      "In some videos, the boy's arm can be seen covered in small dark spots  \u2014 purple suction bruises from his wrist to his armpit.",
      "\"He started saying, 'Mom, it's not letting me go,'\" Taryn said in one TikTok video.",
      "It took three adults to get the octopus off the small boy's arm, she said.",
      "Shortly after the accident, the San Antonio Aquarium posted a video on TikTok about the bruises this octopus can leave behind, but did not directly refer to the story Taryn has been sharing. The employee in the video said the bruises are not harmful and will go away within 7 to 14 days.",
      "Meg Mindlin, an octopus biologist, said octopi \"sense and explore their environment\" using their arms, and rely on taste sensors in their suction cups to understand what is going on in their world.",
      "Taryn's videos have sparked online debate about whether it's safe for kids to touch these animals, but Taryn has refrained from calling the accident an attack. She has said in videos that she and Leo have since returned to the San Antonio Aquarium to see the same octopus.",
      "Still, she says she never received any kind of warning about what the octopus could do before allowing her child to interact with it. She's taken to social media, she said, to share the warning for others, because while Leo was calm in the situation, other children may not be.",
      "On TikTok, she has campaigned for safer and more comfortable living conditions for this animal and others in similar situations.",
      "Taryn says she has reached out to the San Antonio Aquarium and has asked them to properly document the incident and for an explanation of the aquarium's safety protocols for when visitors interact with animals. As of a video posted Monday, she had not heard back."

    "story": [
      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe was sentenced Friday to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a historic case that gripped the South American nation and tarnished the conservative strongman\u2019s legacy.",
      "The sentence, which Uribe said will be appealed, followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that he attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cPolitics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\u201d Uribe said after Friday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense\u2019s request because it would be \u201ceasy\u201d for the former president to leave the country to \u201cevade the imposed sanction.\u201d",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday\u2019s sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \u201cthink much more about the solution than the problem\u201d during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia\u2019s Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "Uribe in 2012 filed a libel suit against Cepeda in the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court in 2018 dismissed the accusations against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe.",
      "Martha Pe\u00f1uela Rosales, a supporter of Uribe\u2019s party in the capital, Bogota, said she wept and prayed after hearing of the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an unjust sentence. He deserves to be free,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Sergio Andr\u00e9s Parra, who protested against Uribe outside the courthouse, said the 12-year sentence \u201cis enough\u201d and, even if the former president appeals, \u201chistory has already condemned him.\u201d",
      "During Uribe\u2019s presidency, Colombia\u2019s military attained some of its biggest battlefield victories against Latin America\u2019s oldest leftist insurgency, pushing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into remote pockets and forcing the group\u2019s leadership into peace talks that led to the disarmament of more than 13,000 fighters in 2016."

    "summary": "Brands are already raising prices, so experts recommend buying tech, household basics, clothing and baby gear before costs go up even more.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don\u2019t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1.",
      "Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there\u2019s still time to save \u2014 tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year.",
      "Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "What to buy as tariff-related price hikes roll out",
      "We don\u2019t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn\u2019t mean you should panic buy \u2014 it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you\u2019ve been saving up for. It\u2019s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty.",
      "A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t shooting up.  But it\u2019s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We\u2019re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again.",
      "Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too.",
      "Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They\u2019re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties.",

These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide.",
      "Bounty Paper Towels",
      "Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines.",

      "Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor.",

      "While Nintendo didn\u2019t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said \u201cother adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.\u201d",
      "The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it\u2019s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon \u2014 its price could increase at any point, and it\u2019s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It\u2019s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games.",
      "Google Pixel Watch 3",
      "Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it\u2019s Google\u2019s best smartwatch yet, although it\u2019s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon).

      "Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings",
      "Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer.

Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja\u2019s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it\u2019s big enough to feed a few people,  yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand.",
      "Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum",
      "We recommend Dyson\u2019s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy \u2014 Dyson\u2019s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool.",

      "In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven\u2019t seen yet \u2014 that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand\u2019s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions.",
      "Ikea Kallax Shelf Unit",
      "Ikea\u2019s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they\u2019re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz\u2019s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. \u201cThis storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City \u2014 it\u2019s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.\u201d",
      "Casper Original Hybrid Mattress",
      "Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas \u2014 that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers.",
      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper\u2019s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. \u201cI bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I\u2019m really picky about my mattresses because I\u2019m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn\u2019t trap heat, in my experience.\u201d",
      "Baby gear",
      "Uppababy Aria Infant Car Seat",
      "The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you\u2019re in the market for one of the brand\u2019s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand\u2019s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand\u2019s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you\u2019re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent.",
      "Coterie Monthly Diaper Box",
      "Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited \u201cglobal economic factors and rising material costs\u201d as the reason for the hike.",
      "Rabinowitz started buying the brand\u2019s diapers when his baby was born last year. \u201cUsing Coterie\u2019s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don\u2019t have ingredients that I\u2019m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cThe subscription is easy to use and very flexible \u2014 if I\u2019m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.\u201d",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2 Travel Stroller",
      "Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn\u2019t specify which ones \u2014 if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo\u2019s compact travel stroller. \u201cThe Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it\u2019s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.\u201d",

      "Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. If a company brings foreign goods into the U.S., it must pay the U.S. government a percentage of those goods.",
      "Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China and Mexico are also in ongoing talks with the U.S. about tariffs \u2014 China's pause on duties expires on Aug. 12 and Mexico's pause expires at the end of October.",

      "Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven\u2019t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April \u2014 that won\u2019t be the case forever though. \u201cCompanies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that\u2019s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,\u201d says Ales. \u201cBut eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they\u2019ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.\u201d",
      "Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. \u201cThe tariff needs to be absorbed by someone \u2014 is it the business or the consumer?,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it\u2019s going to be almost universal,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cRight now, it seems like it\u2019s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.\u201d That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal.",
      "There\u2019s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by.",
      "Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. \u201cSo far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There\u2019s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they\u2019re accepting the volatility around tariffs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don\u2019t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.\u201d",
      "Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now.",

      "\u201c'Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u2019 is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story,\u201d the company's statement reads.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cGreat jeans look good on everyone.\u201d",
      "The advertisements feature the \"Anyone But You\" actor modeling denim from the brand while cuddling a puppy, fixing a car and zipping up the fly of her jeans. It also uses wordplay.",
      "In one set of posters, the tagline is printed out as, \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Genes.\" The video then shows the final word crossed out and rewritten as \"Jeans.\"",
      "Critics online were quick to lambast the advertisement and claim the messaging was rooted in outdated beauty standards and racially biased undertones. Some of the ads, which featured close-ups of Sweeney's body, also led to claims that the videos objectified the actor and appealed to a male gaze.",
      "A representative for Sweeney declined to comment on the backlash.",
      "Cheryl Overton of the integrated marketing communications firm Cheryl Overton Communications previously told TODAY.com that while the ad isn't explicit in its references to race, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum,\u201d adding it was created in \u201ca country actively grappling with social standards rooted in whiteness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe subtext isn\u2019t imagined; it\u2019s rooted in centuries-old narrative about one archetype of beauty that is seen as genetically superior or \u2018aspirational,\u201d she said."

      "\"Hello, Kim. I'm already feeling 10 years younger,\" he said before making a slurping noise, a nod to a scene in the 1991 psychological thriller when he tells Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee, that he ate a man's liver with some \"fava beans and a nice chianti.\"",
      "\"Goodbye,\" he added before the video ended. The caption of Hopkins' video also made a subtle reference to the film. \"Thank you, Kim. Don\u2019t be afraid to come over for dinner,\" the message read.",
      "Online, the eerie clip was received well by fans. In the comments of Hopkins\u2019 post many people referenced his Dr. Hannibal Lecter character, who was forced to wear a nude-colored restraint mask in the film to prevent him from biting others.",
      "\"Are you having Kim for dinner???\" one person quipped.",

      "Another said, \"Pretty sure the fabric is infused with propaganda. There\u2019s 0 proof this works scientifically.\"",
      "However, some people on X felt differently about it.",
      "\"A good item I think,\" one person said.",
      "\"It\u2019s interesting,\" another wrote of the news.",
      "In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Kardashian revealed why she started Skims and said it was born out of her insecurities.",

      "Kardashian noted that she \"always loved shapewear\" and that's what made Skims the perfect fit for her.",
      "\"I really wanted to launch my own shapewear that took all the designs that I was cutting up myself, that I was dying myself and just had an extremely inclusive age-wise, size-wise, color-range-wise everything,\" she added."

      "Josh Brolin, who played Brand in the classic 1985 adventure flick, says he would love a second film in the series, but does worry that it could ruin the perception of the original film.",
      "\u201cI hope it does (happen) because the experience was so great. The movie is received so well, generation after generation. It\u2019s just everything good about it,\u201d he told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d at the \"Weapons\" premiere in Los Angeles on July 31.",
      "\u201cThe trepidation that I have is that you release something else that taints that. I don\u2019t want to taint what my memory of it (is), you know what I mean? It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we came out with another\u2019 and then the Goonies grew up and then they came out with their walkers and then they fell off a cliff because they couldn\u2019t see very well. What are you going to do? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Brolin thinks Steven Spielberg, who produced the original movie, has to be onboard to make a follow-up happen.",
      "\u201cIf Spielberg approves it, you know it\u2019s going to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s been five scripts so far through the years and he hasn\u2019t approved anything yet. So, me being picky? Spielberg is picky and he has a reason to be because he has great taste.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Warner Bros. officially confirmed a \u201cGoonies\u201d sequel, with Spielberg and Chris Columbus, who also wrote the original, set to produce. There was no word on a plot or who will star in it.",
      "\u201cI can tell you for sure, Spielberg and Chris Columbus have a recipe, and they\u2019re planning on something. We wish them well. And if they come to us, we\u2019ll consider it at that time,\u201d Corey Feldman told TODAY earlier this year when several members of the cast appeared at Awesome Con in Washington, D.C.",
      "The \u201dGoonies\u201d cast has remained very supportive of each other, too. Brolin, Feldman, Jeff Cohen and Kerri Green all turned out when Ke Huy Quan was honored during a handprint and footprint ceremony at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles in February.",
      "\u201c\u2018The Goonies\u2019 till this day is still one of the greatest adventures of my life, and it wouldn\u2019t be an adventure without you and all my fellow Goonies \u2014 Josh, Corey, Jeff, Kerri, Martha (Plimpton) and Sean (Astin). So, thank you guys,\u201d Quan said."

      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for \u201cMy Oxford Year.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d the movie adaptation of Julia Whelan\u2019s 2018 novel, ends with a shocking twist \u2014 and star Sofia Carson broke it down for TODAY.com.",
      "Carson both executive produced and starred in the film, released Aug. 1 on Netflix. The movie follows Carson\u2019s character Anna as she moves to Oxford to study poetry for a year at the famous university.",
      "Anna has planned her entire life out, but, along the way, she unexpectedly falls head over heels with her charming professor, Jamie (Corey Mylchreest).",
      "Their relationship seems perfect at first. Then comes a complication. Anna learns that Jamie has multiple myeloma, the same blood cancer his brother died from years prior.",
      "Jamie is determined to make the most of his final months instead of spending them in a hospital bed. Ignoring his parents\u2019 urges, Jamie stops treatment, and he and Anna set out to squeeze as many memories as possible out of the time they have left.",
      "\u201cShe walks into the film believing that living deliberately means planning every second of her life, and she walks away from this movie such a transformed person,\u201d Carson tells TODAY.com of Anna's journey.",
      "Midway through the film, Anna makes a decision that temporarily halts her relationship with Jamie. While she has a job lined up at Goldman Sachs once her year at Oxford finishes, she tells Jamie she wants to give it up so she can stay with him. Jamie thinks she is making a mistake by throwing away her future, and the pair separates.",
      "However, the duo reconciles when Anna convinces Jamie that her only future is with him. The next morning, Anna wakes up to find Jamie lying unconscious in bed. They rush to the hospital, and Jamie learns he has a severe case of pneumonia. In Jamie\u2019s hospital room, they discuss a big trip to visit all the European sights that Jamie wants Anna to see.",
      "During the film\u2019s final sequences, Anna and Jamie travel Europe, visiting cities like Paris, Venice and Amsterdam. It seems like Jamie has recovered \u2014 but it turns out these memories only belong to Anna. Jamie has already died, and she is on the adventure alone, imagining what it would be like if Jamie were with her.",
      "Carson says that this heartbreaking moment in the film is captured by one of the movie's many literary references.",
      "\u201cI always go back to one of the authors that we quote often. Alfred Tennyson once said, \u2018It\u2019s better to have loved than lost than never to have loved at all,\u201d Carson says. \u201cThat is such a timeless and profound truth that I think we\u2019re reminded of in this story.\u201d",
      "Carson added that dealing with the film\u2019s profound subject matter was a \u201cbeautiful challenge.\u201d One of her favorite parts of the film was how they handled its tragic ending with comedy.",
      "\u201cIt was so important that comedy was the thing that always grounded our film. I think in times of darkness and loss, comedy is often how we cope,\u201d Carson says. \u201cComedy is what makes even the deepest moments just hit even harder.\u201d",
      "Another literary reference that stuck with Carson was the Emily Dickinson she set as Anna\u2019s lock screen: \u201cForever is composed of now.\u201d",
      "\u201cLife exists in the messiness, in the moments, in the now. All we have is a succession of moments,\u201d Carson says. \u201cI love \u2018forever is composed of now.\u2019 I always go back to that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Before one of its planes crashed just after takeoff last month, killing at least 260 people, Air India had been a symbol of the country\u2019s global rise.",
      "Only two years earlier, chief executive Campbell Wilson had inaugurated a brand-new Airbus A350, Air India\u2019s first, calling it \u201ca declaration of Indian aviation\u2019s resurgence on the world stage.\u201d",
      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",
      "\u201cInvestigations of this magnitude take time,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said, while India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau urged the public and the media to \u201crefrain from spreading premature narratives.\u201d",
      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",
      "Capt. C.S. Randhawa, a former pilot for Air India and the Indian air force, said the suggestion that one of the pilots may have crashed the plane deliberately has \u201cdemoralized the pilots in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll pilots are up in arms, and it\u2019s not a good thing. The pilots have to fly with that mental attitude,\u201d Randhawa, who is currently the president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told NBC News.",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the crash did not appear to have been caused by a mechanical issue with the Boeing fuel control unit. The final report is due next year.",
      "On top of the lack of clarity, some British families hoping to bury their loved ones said they had received the remains of the wrong people, according to the Daily Mail, which cited a lawyer representing them. The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",
      "The airline, which voluntarily disclosed the problems last month, said Friday that it would respond to the regulator and that it \u201cremains fully committed to ensuring the safety of its passengers and staff.\u201d",
      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",
      "Things moved quickly after the takeover by the Tata Group, which consolidated several airlines it controlled, including Vistara and Air Asia India, into two entities: the full-cost carrier Air India and its budget arm, Air India Express.",
      "Vistara, which was partly owned by Singapore Airlines, was particularly beloved by Indians, known for its modern planes and best-in-class customer experience. When it merged with Air India, travelers and crew hoped that Air India would be the true Vistara successor.",
      "But Air India has struggled to deliver change as fast as some had hoped.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with maintenance issues, disrepair issues, and all these things are taking time,\u201d Randhawa said."

      "Katie Ledecky stubbornly refused to give up her 800-meter freestyle crown Saturday at the world championships in Singapore, winning that race for a seventh consecutive time and fending off Canada's Summer McIntosh who led a field of talented young, would-be usurpers.",
      "The seven world wins put Ledecky to the top of charts of most triumphs in a single event, as she passed her own record of six victories at the 1500 free and Sweden's Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m of six titles in the 50 butterfly.",
      "Ledecky said she didn't feel too much pressure coming into this race, satisfied with how she's been training all year.",
      "\"It's been a really great season and I think coming into tonight, no matter what the outcome was, I was gonna be really happy with my season,\" she told NBC Sports.  \"And I think I just took the pressure off and allowed me to enjoy the race and kind of appreciate that moment.\"",
      "Ledecky forced the early pace with McIntosh keeping her in close range.",

      "\u201cThat last 100 was pretty stressful,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cLani was and Summer was right there.\u201d",
      "Ledecky clocked in at 8:05.62, Pallister at 8:05.98 and McIntosh 8:07.29. It was by far, the closest worlds win of Ledecky's seven at the 800 free.",

      "McIntosh vowed to use Saturday's disappointment as fuel for future 800-meter efforts.",
      "\"I really wanted to swim my own race and I didn't do that,\" said McIntosh, who congratulated Ledecky and called her an \u201cinspiration of mine.\u201d",
      "\"I think what I did tonight actually makes me want to keep doing it more, to see how much better I can get at it because I know I can be way faster than I was tonight.\"",

      "\"I'm looking forward to that,\" she said. \"It's home to me but I'm with the people that I love, around the pool.\"",
      "The niece of New York Islanders co-owner Jon Ledecky has also been dominating the 800 free at the Olympics, having won gold in this race at the 2012 games in London, 2016 in Rio, 2021 in Tokyo and last summer near Paris.",
      "She\u2019s the only woman to win the same individual event at four Olympics, in any sport. The only other swimmer to pull off such a four-peat was American legend Michael Phelps, who took the 200 individual medley in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016.",
      "At age 28, Ledecky was the field's oldest swimmer and she outdueled her youngest and most fierce competitor, the 18-year-old Toronto native McIntosh.",
      "Ledecky\u2019s air of 800 invincibility was dented last year when a 17-year-old McIntosh beat the American at the Southern Zone South Sectional Championships in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 8.",

      "If McIntosh takes on the 800 free in Los Angeles, Saturday\u2019s race offered a tantalizing preview of what could be in store for 2028."

      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe was sentenced Friday to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a historic case that gripped the South American nation and tarnished the conservative strongman\u2019s legacy.",
      "The sentence, which Uribe said will be appealed, followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that he attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cPolitics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\u201d Uribe said after Friday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense\u2019s request because it would be \u201ceasy\u201d for the former president to leave the country to \u201cevade the imposed sanction.\u201d",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday\u2019s sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \u201cthink much more about the solution than the problem\u201d during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia\u2019s Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "Uribe in 2012 filed a libel suit against Cepeda in the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court in 2018 dismissed the accusations against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe.",
      "Martha Pe\u00f1uela Rosales, a supporter of Uribe\u2019s party in the capital, Bogota, said she wept and prayed after hearing of the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an unjust sentence. He deserves to be free,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Sergio Andr\u00e9s Parra, who protested against Uribe outside the courthouse, said the 12-year sentence \u201cis enough\u201d and, even if the former president appeals, \u201chistory has already condemned him.\u201d",

      "Blondie, a tourist favorite, was hunted down after being lured and baited out of Gwayi Conservancy, near Hwange National Park, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH), an advocacy organization based in the U.K.",
      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",

      "Africa Geographic\u2019s CEO, Simon Epsley, said the organization was \u201cdismayed and angered\u201d at the killing.",
      "\u201cThat Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d he said.",
      "Collars are used to track the animals, limit wildlife-human conflict and support conservation.",
      "Zimbabwean law allows a maximum of 100 lions above the age of 6 to be hunted each year in the country, where safaris and big game hunting are important sources of income.",
      "A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks Agency, the government hunting regulator, denied that Blondie\u2019s killing had broken the law because he was older than 6.",
      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",

      "In 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer sparked outrage when he admittedly killed Cecil the Lion after paying $50,000 for the experience.",
      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",

      "More than 160 people \u2014 at least 90 of them children \u2014 have died of malnutrition since the war began, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "The world\u2019s leading body on hunger, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), says that nearly all of Gaza is suffering a food security crisis or worse, and more than half of the population is in the \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201ccatastrophe\u201d phase of starvation \u2014 which means recovering isn\u2019t as simple as giving starving people food.",
      "Rather, giving food to people experiencing such an extreme degree of starvation could kill them, experts say.",
      "\u201cIf you do what the body wants to do, which is to just drink and eat as much as possible the minute you see food, you can actually create these permanent imbalances that can cause things like heart failure or organ damage, because the body had to adapt to get to that starvation mode,\u201d NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel, an internal medicine doctor, said.",
      "At the most severe stages of starvation, even giving a person water can push their body into failure, Patel said.",
      "What happens to the body when it\u2019s starving?",
      "Humans can generally go without any food or water for several days because the body finds a way to adapt in order to survive. First by feeding off of so-called glycogen stores \u2014 a starchy substance from carbohydrates that\u2019s stored in the liver and muscles. The body stores about 1,700 to 2,200 calories\u2019 worth of energy as glycogen.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing your body goes for that can get you through without eating or any water for about several days, in some cases, maybe a little longer,\u201d Patel said.",
      "Once those glycogen stores are depleted, the body starts to break down fat for energy, but when that\u2019s gone, it turns to muscle. This is what causes the body to shrink and the starving person to assume a gaunt, hollow-cheeked look.Eventually the brain doesn\u2019t have the energy it needs to function, leading to irritability, mood swings and trouble concentrating.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to even just make sound judgments,\u201d Patel said. \u201cYou can see people have psychotic illusions. You can see people hearing things. All of that is basically the body\u2019s way of surviving.\u201d",
      "Most starving people die from infections as their immune system shuts down. Eventually, the heart will be affected, causing a person\u2019s blood pressure and pulse to drop. If they don\u2019t die from infection, the heart will shut down, doctors said.",
      "The more vulnerable parts of the population are likely to suffer the most. \u201cChildren \u2014 specifically infants \u2014 pregnant women, the elderly and people with certain kinds of chronic illness are the risk groups that we need to pay special attention to,\u201d said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.",
      "How is starvation treated?",
      "Patel said a good analogy to giving food to a starving person is a downpour after a drought. The land desperately needs water, but because it\u2019s so dry it repels water instead of absorbing it, leading to flash flooding. \u201cRefeeding\u201d after starvation needs to be managed clinically and by medical professionals.",
      "\u201cWhen a person has reached a state of starvation, the body undergoes extreme metabolic changes,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving too much food \u2014 or the wrong kind \u2014 too quickly can trigger a dangerous shift in fluids and electrolytes known as refeeding syndrome, which can be fatal if not carefully managed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA bag of flour \u2014 some of the only food aid that has gotten in recently \u2014 won\u2019t save anyone because it has none of the essential nutrients,\u201d said Dr. Nour Alamassi, a doctor and the medical team lead for Project HOPE, an international nongovernmental organization focused on global health and humanitarian aid.",
      "\u201cToo many carbs can actually be life-threatening for anyone with Severe Acute Malnourishment (SAM), and even for the average person in Gaza who has not had a regular diet in many months, it is very difficult to digest,\u201d Alamassi, who is caring for children and pregnant women in Gaza, wrote in an email.",
      "Ideally, doctors told NBC News, there would be enough medical staff to monitor the refeeding process for each person for a period stretching from weeks to even months. Children would be stabilized with fortified milks, which contain the nutrients that a malnourished child needs, and something called ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF), which are energy-dense, easy to digest and carefully balanced in the nutrients children need to start to recover. Doctors would draw blood to monitor sodium and potassium levels \u2014 if these electrolytes are too low or too high, it can be deadly.",
      "But the situation on the ground in Gaza is far from ideal. There are not enough doctors, not enough supplies and not the right supplies, experts say.",
      "\u201cThe aid blockade has prevented us from accessing the medications and nutrition supplies that are necessary to treat these people,\u201d Alamassi said. \u201cWe recently ran out of High Energy Biscuits (HEB) in our clinics, which really limits our ability to help patients. We hope to get more in the coming days, but each day without these supplies can make a major difference for a patient\u2019s outcome.\u201d",
      "What are the long-term effects of starvation?",
      "Even if refeeding is successful, people who survive starvation can experience physical and psychological effects for the rest of their lives, experts said. The damage, especially for young and very old victims, is permanent.",
      "In children, malnutrition can cause delays in both physical and cognitive development. Physically, they\u2019re more likely to have weakened immune systems, leading to a harder time recovering from infections. Malnourished children are also more likely to experience stunted growth, which can affect their height, muscle mass and bone density and even delay puberty, experts said.",
      "Cognitively, children can suffer from permanent brain damage due to iron and zinc deficiencies, affecting their ability to learn and problem solve.",
      "Alamassi said the hunger crisis in Gaza is affecting \u201can entire generation of children who will suffer lifelong consequences.\u201dThe recovery of adults from very severe malnutrition is not only possible, but likely, Redlener said.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s done right, most adults, unless they\u2019re really at a terminal stage of undernutrition, the refeeding will result in restoration of everything \u2014 a far different story than the ability for a young child with prolonged malnutrition, where it\u2019s often impossible to get a full recovery,\u201d he said.",
      "Patel said even people with a history of malnutrition are monitored over years to make sure their bodies are functioning properly.",
      "\u201cAs they age and develop, different parts of the body pull on memories of that nutrition depletion,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question we all have to ask ourselves is, how long are we going to be able to do this without having adequate support on the ground?\u201d"
