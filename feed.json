      "Alabama\u2019s Ryan Williams and Ohio State\u2019s Jeremiah Smith are the cover athletes for EA Sports College Football 26",
      "Alabama's Ryan Williams and Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith are the cover athletes for EA Sports College Football 26, the video-game developer announced Tuesday.",
      "The electric sophomore wide receivers were picked for the second edition of the franchise's reboot. Last year's game was the first in 11 years and was among the best-selling video games in 2024.",
      "Williams and Smith are posed together on the standard cover, while the deluxe edition also includes other players, coaches, mascots and former cover stars Reggie Bush, Tim Tebow and Denard Robinson.",
      "The \u201826 edition will test if the franchise still has the same staying power it had when it was released annually in the early 2000s.",
      "For the players who are featured in the game, it will certainly remain popular. Williams said in a statement released by EA Sports that the cover was \u201ca dream come true,\u201d and Smith called it \u201ca tremendous privilege.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to represent Ohio State alongside Coach (Ryan) Day while carrying the Buckeye legacy forward, celebrating the passion of our fans and the tradition of this incredible program,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Williams and Smith broke onto the national scene in 2024 with their miraculous catches on the biggest stages.",
      "Williams' spinning TD grab to help beat then-No. 2 Georgia looked like it belonged in a video game. It was one of many wowing plays from the young receiver. Williams finished his freshman season with 48 receptions for 865 yards and eight receiving touchdowns.",
      "Smith was a major part of the Buckeyes' run to a national championship. He regularly hauled in one-handers that decimated the confidence of his defenders. In a CFP quarterfinals win over top-seeded Oregon, Smith had seven receptions, 187 yards and two touchdowns. He finished his freshman year with 76 catches, 1,315 yards and 15 receiving touchdowns.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran has summoned France's representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression.\u201d",
      "Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had praised \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d after it won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. The Iranian film centers on a man who abducts his suspected captor after being tortured in prison.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the French charge d\u2019affaires was summoned over the minister\u2019s \u201cinterventionist, irresponsible and instigative allegations,\u201d the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "\u201cSpare us Iranians the lectures. You have no moral authority whatsoever,\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on \u201cX,\u201d citing France's approach to Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. France last week threatened \u201cconcrete action\u201d against Israel if the country didn't halt the offensive in Gaza and lift restrictions on humanitarian aid, but the statement was mostly dismissed as empty threats.",
      "Immediately following the award's announcement, the Iranian state news agency had announced a more muted celebration of the award, crediting the country\u2019s film industry for winning a second Palme d\u2019Or after Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s 1997 drama, \u201cTaste of Cherry.\"",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won\u2019t allow him to make the films he wants to, and \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was filmed without cooperation. Iranian state TV called the film a mixture of \u201clie and smearing\u201d as well as an \u201cunderground\u201d film produced without required permits in Iran. State TV also chastised Panahi for not mentioning the plight of the Palestinians in his acceptance speech.",
      "The film follows a man named Vahid, played by Vahid Mobasser, who believes he sees his former captor, who tortured him in prison and ruined his life. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In a strange and emotional journey, they are all forced to grapple with revenge and forgiveness. Panahi drew on the experiences from his own imprisonment as well as the stories of detainees around him.",
      "Other state media were more critical of the win. The Mizan news agency, an arm of the country\u2019s judiciary, reported on the win as part of the \u201cPolitical Cannes Film Festival,\u201d suggesting that the prize was given to Panahi because of his political leanings.",
      "Pro-reform media outlets and activists praised Panahi. \u201cThis victory is no accident \u2014 it is the result of a tireless dedication to exploring humanistic values and human rights,\u201d said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who was also previously imprisoned at Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison. Inmates at the prison include those with Western ties and political prisoners.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in anti-government protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "Panahi was arrested in 2022 when he went to the Tehran prosecutor\u2019s office to inquire about the arrests of two other Iranian filmmakers. A judge later ruled that he must serve six years for an earlier sentence on charges of propagandizing against the government from 2011 that had never been enforced. In early 2023, Panahi went on a hunger strike and was released from Evin Prison.",
      "Panahi said he would not seek asylum in another country, despite the risks of additional imprisonment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he said last week from the Cannes festival. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- King Charles III arrives in Ottawa this week to underscore Canada's sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne that will outline his government's agenda for the new Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cHis Majesty King Charles III will read the speech from the throne and thus present the plan of our government, our priorities, as Canada is facing a pivotal moment in its history, the biggest transformation of the global trading system since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" Carney told his caucus Sunday.",
      "Carney said \u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in the sovereign\" when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe are different and the king illustrates that,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cIf you look at why King Charles is reading the speech from the throne than you have to then acknowledge Canada\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn\u2019t necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that if there\u2019s a message to be sent there\u2019s easier ways to do that like calling him or calling the president.",
      "Royal historian Carolyn Harris expects Trump to notice the visit because the president has repeatedly spoken about his admiration for the royal family.",
      "Harris said Trump might see how different Canada is from the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt is a very distinctive history that goes back to the waves of loyalists who settled here after the American revolution,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to seeing the king in a Canadian context, escorted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, surrounded by Canadian symbolism. This is very much King Charles III in his role as King of Canada.\u201d",
      "The speech, which will be delivered Tuesday, is not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state. The king will read what is put before him by Canada\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCharles can only act with the consent and with the advice of his prime minister. But at the same time he cannot act in a way that would throw any of the other 14 Commonwealth realms under the bus. So it is finest tightrope to walk,\" said Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian.",
      "Canadians were not happy when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended a state visit invitation to Trump on behalf of the king during a time when Trump threatened Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\u201cTo be frank,\u201d Carney told Britain's Sky News. \u201cThey weren\u2019t impressed by that gesture, quite simply, given the circumstance. It was a time when we were quite clear ... about the issues around sovereignty.\"",
      "The king has more recently been showing support for Canada, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a British aircraft carrier.",
      "After he arrives on Monday he will drop the ceremonial first puck or ball during a street hockey game. He will also attend a community event and meet with Carney and Canada's governor general, his representative as head of state. The king will return to the U.K. after Tuesday's speech and a visit to Canada's National War Memorial.",

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 in Cannes held up Panahi's name to honor the director when he was under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\u201cLet us join forces,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cNo one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\u201d",
      "The win for \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d extended an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d'Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cTitane,\u201d \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d and \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cAnora,\u201d won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike his friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was inspired by Panahi's experience in prison. In the film, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "Panahi was jailed in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison after going there to inquire about the then-jailed Rasoulof. Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.",
      "In 2009, he was banned from traveling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continued to make films illegally in Iran, without a permit, and had his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.",
      "\u201cThe film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\u201d Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \u201cArt will always win. What is human will always win.\u201d",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "\u201cA day without electricity,\" sighed John C. Reilly, who sang an English-language \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d at the ceremony. The festival's films, he said, supplied \u201call the needed electricity.\"",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier\u2019s Norwegian family drama \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d his lauded follow-up to \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Some had expected \u201cSentimental Value\u201d to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\u201cWe live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\u201d",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s Brazilian political thriller \u201cThe Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \u201cThat was our wish.\u201d",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \u201cshow that our country\u2019s cinema is second to none.\u201d",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe\u2019s desert road trip \u201cSir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \u201cThe Little Sister,\u201d Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \u201cYoung Mothers.\u201d Its their ninth prize in Cannes. The festival's award for best first film, the Camera d'Or, went to Hasan Hadi for \u201cThe President's Cake,\u201d making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "Saturday's ceremony brought to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \u201cCan you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn\u2019t ship that way,\u201d said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d at the festival.

      "Panahi's win put him in rare company. He's now won Cannes' Palme d'Or, Venice's Golden Lion (for \u201cThe Circle\u201d) and Berlin's Golden Bear (for \u201cTaxi\u201d). Only three other filmmakers have done that: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman.",
      "Addressing reporters after his win, Panahi spoke about filmmakers and artists always being able to find a way, \u201ceven in complicated situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey must realize that no powers that be can halt such people in their tracks,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cYou have this power.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Matt Wolf learned that Paul Reubens had died along with the rest of the world",
      "Paul Reubens did not tell his director that he was dying.",
      "On July 31, 2023, the news of Reubens' death came as a shock to documentary filmmaker Matt Wolf, who had spent a year trying to convince him to make the ambitious two-part documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max, and over 40 hours interviewing him on camera.",
      "But in 2023, the project was in danger of falling apart: The two had been at an impasse for a while over the issue of creative control and they\u2019d finally found a way forward. He had one last interview scheduled, set for the first week of August. Then the texts started coming in. Wolf sat there shaking.",
      "They\u2019d spoken about everything \u2014 Reubens' childhood, his complicated relationship with fame, his ambitions, his commitment to his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman, his sexuality, his arrest \u2014 except the fact that he\u2019d been battling cancer for the past six years. But after the initial shock, a renewed purpose set in.",
      "\u201cI went to work the day after Paul died. I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview through the night and was struck by the significance and meaning that came by understanding that he was privately contemplating mortality,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was aware that this was an extraordinary situation that was part of the story of the film and that the stakes were the highest I had ever experienced.\u201d",
      "For the next year, Wolf would wake up and say to himself, \u201cYou cannot drop the ball. Rise to the occasion.\u201d It was, he said, \u201cthe most challenging and involved and emotional process of filmmaking that I\u2019ve ever gone through and maybe that I\u2019ll ever go through again.\u201d",
      "Reubens wanted to direct his own documentary. He\u2019d always prized creative control and couldn\u2019t fathom why he would cede it in telling his own story for the first time. But everyone around him seemed to think that was a bad idea. It would take over a year of getting to know Wolf, whose film credits include documentaries about cellist Arthur Russell and news archivist Marion Stokes, to consider letting go.",
      "Even after Reubens had agreed to let Wolf direct the project, he continued to push back and resist at times. Early on, they decided to record their phone conversations as well, recognizing that their dynamic illuminated something true about Reubens.",
      "\u201cRight away, Paul was sort of rebelling against the process, blowing off steam, procrastinating, teasing me, sometimes being adversarial, but in a funny wink-wink way,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was frustrated. I thought, how am I ever going to get through this? This is the most resistant interview subject I\u2019ve ever encountered. Then I realized this is actually a pretty significant form of portraiture. This is showing Paul\u2019s discomfort and uncertainty about really showing and sharing himself.\u201d",
      "The result is a collaboration, Wolf said, but one in which he also had editorial control. It wasn\u2019t going to be a hit piece, but it wasn\u2019t going to be a puff piece either.",
      "Wolf, 43, was part of the generation of kids who grew up with the children\u2019s television series \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was, he said, the first time he\u2019d felt viscerally moved by a work of art.",
      "Still, he wasn\u2019t approaching the project as a fan. He was coming as a filmmaker who makes documentaries about gay artists and unconventional visionaries who \u201cbeg for reappraisal.\u201d Unlike most of his subjects, however, Reubens was an icon and a cult figure.",
      "\u201cI was determined not to make a film that fell into the traps of the celebrity biopic with platitudes from other famous people and manufactured self-reflection,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI wanted to make portrait of an artist.\u201d",
      "Much of the film focuses on the prehistory of Pee-wee, showing how his childhood, his artistic awakening, his early improv days and his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d rejection would converge into the commitment to this alter ego. Part of that involved engaging with Reubens\u2019 sexuality in a direct way. In the film, Reubens speaks about living openly as a gay man, and then going back in the closet.",
      "\u201cHe had always intended to come out but was very ambivalent about that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I saw myself as a younger gay person who could help somebody achieve that and also to give a sense of nuance and depth to his artistry that one could appreciate, and to understand the personal sacrifices that were required for him to do that.\u201d",
      "Reubens\u2019 career was derailed when he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in 1991. He was handed a small fine but the damage was incalculable. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography, which was reduced to an obscenity charge with probation. These are covered in the documentary\u2019s second part.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to set the record straight, particularly about the unfortunate footnotes of his arrest, which to some extent have overshadowed his artistic accomplishments,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat to me felt like the easy part and also the least interesting part of the film.\u201d",
      "\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, where Wolf got to see emotional responses from audiences, no matter if they came to it as fans or out of some curiosity around the controversies. That emotional intensity was what he hoped they\u2019d feel.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film with a big range of emotions, from joy and delight to tragedy and sorrow,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cPaul contains that big spectrum of feelings. And I wanted the viewer to feel it, to have a lasting connection to him. When a film can affect you emotionally it becomes unforgettable.\u201d",

      "The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars: Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and relative newcomer Harris Dickinson.",
      "Their films are very different but the fulfillment of longtime dreams of being behind the camera. All three movies are part of Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, which has helped launch the careers of directors like Yorgos Lanthimos, Lynne Ramsay and Molly Manning Walker.",
      "At 28, Dickinson is an up-and-coming actor, known for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d and the Palme d'Or-winning \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d who worked for years to develop his film, \u201cUrchin.\u201d",
      "Johansson, a two-time Oscar acting nominee who's been a star since her teens and played Black Widow in multiple Marvel films, brought \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a film about a nonagenarian who coopts her late friend's Holocaust story, to Cannes this week.",
      "Stewart, also an acting Oscar nominee, debuted \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, last week.",
      "Awards for the Un Certain Regard section will be announced Friday, a day before the Cannes Film Festival closes.",
      "Here's what the actors-turned-directors had to say about their first forays into creating a film from behind the camera.",
      "\u201cI wanted to direct from a very young age. I wanted to make films,\u201d says Dickinson, who got his start as many young creators do now: on YouTube. He even had a web sketch series. \u201cThat was my first love, just making things.\u201d",
      "Dickinson's profile as an actor has exploded in recent years, but his desire to direct was so strong, he started saying no to roles.",
      "\u201c'Urchin' was all I could think about. It was pouring out of me. It was all that was on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no when you\u2019ve got something to take you away from that, you know? Nothing that came in would make me question my own film, which is a sign that I had to make it at this time.\u201d",
      "The film stars Frank Dillane as a homeless Londoner suffering from drug addiction.",
      "Johansson is now one of the world's most recognizable stars. She's also one of its most respected, earning two Oscar nominations in 2020, for \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d",
      "Her success as an actor helped her take on new roles on films, including producing, and, now, directing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I worked enough that I stopped worrying about not working, or not being relevant \u2014 which is very liberating,\u201d Johansson says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something all actors feel for a long time until they don\u2019t. I would not have had the confidence to direct this film 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "She says that throughout her career, imagining how to make movies has been part of her process: \u201cWhether it was reading something and thinking, \u2018I can envision this in my mind,\u2019 or even being on a production and thinking, \u2018I am directing some elements of this out of necessity.\u2019\u201d",
      "The New York-set \u201cEleanor the Great\u201d stars June Squibb as a 94-year-old who, out of grief and loneliness, takes over her friend's story of Holocaust survival as her own.",
      "\u201cIt was eight years in the making and then a really accelerated push. It\u2019s an obvious comparison but it was childbirth,\u201d says Stewart of the film. \u201cI was pregnant for a really long time and then I was screaming bloody murder.\u201d",
      "Stewart in interviews has talked about challenging the myth that men are better suited to directing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair for people to think it\u2019s hard to make a movie insofar as you need to know things before going into it. There are technical directors, but, Jesus Christ, you hire a crew. You just have a perspective and trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy inexperience made this movie.\u201d",
      "Yuknavitch's memoir recounts her surviving sexual abuse by her father and how she sought refuge in competitive swimming and, later, writing.",
      "While Stewart expressed doubts that she offered much to her film's star, Imogen Poots, in terms of useful direction, the actor disagrees.",
      "\u201cKristen is incredibly present but at the same has this ability, like a plant or something, to pick up on a slight shift in the atmosphere where it\u2019s like: \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Poots said, causing Stewart to laugh. \u201cThere is this insane brain at play and it\u2019s a skill set that comes in the form of an intense curiosity.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, known for his award-winning images of nature and humanity, died at 81 from leukemia, his family said Friday. Local media reported he died in Paris, where he lived for more than 55 years.",
      "Salgado's style is marked by black-and-white imagery, rich tonality, and emotionally charged scenarios. Many of his best pictures were taken in impoverished communities, especially in the Amazon and in Africa. He was recently experiencing undisclosed health problems.",
      "\u201cThrough the lens of his camera, Sebasti\u00e3o tirelessly fought for a more just, humane, and ecological world,\u201d Salgado's family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs a photographer who traveled the globe continuously, he contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Genesis project. Fifteen years later, complications from this illness developed into severe leukemia, which ultimately took his life,\u201d the family added.",
      "Earlier, Instituto Terra, which was founded by Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado, and the French Academy of Fine Arts, of which he was a member, announced his death, but did not provide details on the circumstances or where he died.",
      "\u201cSebasti\u00e3o was more than one of the best photographers of our time,\u201d Instituto Terra said in a statement. \u201cHis lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, (brought) the power of transformative action.\u201d",
      "Composer Laurent Petitgirard, secretary of the French Academy of Fine Arts, said in a statement that Salgado, one of his colleagues, was \u201cremarkable for his moral integrity, his charisma, and his commitment to serving art.\u201d",
      "\"He leaves behind a monumental body of work,\u201d Petitgirard said about a photographer who received many awards, and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the United States in 1992 and to the French Academy of Fine Arts in 2016.",
      "Salgado\u2019s main works include the recent \u201cAmazonia\u201d series, \u201cWorkers,\u201d which shows manual labor around the world, and \u201cExodus\u201d (also known as \u201cMigrations\u201d or \u201cSahel\u201d), which documents people in transit, including refugees and slum residents.",
      "Salgado had his life and work portrayed in the documentary \u201cThe Salt of the Earth\u201d (2014), co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado. The film was was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2015.",
      "One of Brazil\u2019s most famous artists, though, always insisted he was \u201cjust a photographer.\u201d",
      "Salgado moved to France in 1969 as Brazil endured a military dictatorship. He said in different interviews he was then a leftist militant against the regime.",
      "It was in Paris in 1973 that he started to fully dedicate his time to photography and develop his black-and-white style, years after his economics degree.",
      "His first professional works were for the agency Sygma in 1974. The following year, he documented the lives of peasants and Indigenous peoples in Latin America for the Gamma agency. Five years later, he joined Magnum, a top brand for photographers, of which he later became president.",
      "Salgado left it in 1994 to found Amazonia Images with his wife, an agency that exclusively handles his work.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who received Salgado\u2019s support throughout his political career, requested a minute of silence during a ceremony in the capital city of Brasilia to honor \u201cone of the greatest, if not the greatest, photographer the world has ever produced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis nonconformity with the fact that the world is so unequal and his stubborn talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSalgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and his heart.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron posted a picture of Salgado\u2019s in Alaska in his Instagram profile as a tribute to the photographer, who also had French citizenship.",
      "Salgado and his wife, whom he married in 1967, raised their two sons, Juliano and Rodrigo, in France. His friends said every morning that he could he would breathe the air near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. His death also caused commotion in the country he adopted.",

      "Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Salgado was passionate about their city.",
      "\u201cTonight I cry for a very close friend, a rare soul; a loyal, discreet and sensible man. His death moves us profoundly. He already leaves us an immense void,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cParis, the city that loved him, will give him the honors he deserves.\u201d",

In 1998, they turned a plot of land they owned into a nature reserve, according to Salgado\u2019s biography on the French Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 website. That same year, they created Instituto Terra, which promotes reforestation and environmental education.",

      "Buble, a five-time Grammy-winning pop icon, has signed on to be part of the team's fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society. The \u201cPanthers on the Prowl\u201d initiative combines art and philanthropy to support cancer research and patient services, and donors get the chance to sponsor life-sized panther sculptures that will be placed around South Florida.",

      "\u201c'Panthers on the Prowl' is a creative and really cool and uplifting way to demonstrate and show our support for those people that are suffering, so we can generate the much-needed funding to keep this fight going,\" Buble said. \"Cancer touches all of us, my family, friends, yours, neighbors, everyone. I joined my buddy Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers and all of our NHL hockey community because I want to be part of the solution.\u201d",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne on Tuesday where he will lay out the Canadian government\u2019s agenda when Parliament reopens.",
      "The monarch is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in our sovereign,\" Carney said when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, only did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re different,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cWe are not the United States. It sounds simple, but that\u2019s what the visit says.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same institutions. We don\u2019t have the same history,\u201d Charest said. \"We are a different country with a different choice in terms of how how we built ourselves, and King Charles tells that story.\u201d",
      "This will be Charles' first visit as monarch. He visited Canada 19 times as prince. The king has been showing his support for Canada in recent months, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.",
      "Historian Robert Bothwell said that the king\u2019s speech in Parliament \u201cis a gesture of solidarity and identity that can be construed to be a gesture of support.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn't necessary.",
      "\u201cWe're thrilled that the king will be here. If there's a message in there, you know, there's easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. Carney can call the president at any time,\u201d Hoekstra told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cBut I know what the implication is. It's, oh about ... the 51st state, it's over. And, you know, move on.\u201d",
      "The speech sets the legislative agenda for a new session of Parliament. It's not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state.",
      "The king will read what is put before him by Canada's prime minister and his team. The speech is usually read by Canada's governor general, the monarch's representative in Canada. The governor general holds a constitutional but mostly ceremonial and symbolic position.",
      "\u201cKing Charles is unlikely to comment directly on the 51st state issue. Yet, his introductory remarks could feature broad statements about Canada\u2019s integrity and sovereignty. At least this is what many Canadians would like him to do,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Former Canadian prime ministers and governor generals will attend the speech. The king will then pay his respects at the National War Memorial before a Royal Canadian Air Force flyby.",
      "B\u00e9land said the monarchy has long been unpopular among Quebec\u2019s French-speaking majority, and some nationalist voices in the province have been critical of the Carney government\u2019s decision to invite the king to deliver the throne speech.",
      "\"Whether the separatists work themselves into a lather over this frankly, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think Quebecers will care a lot,\u201d said Charest, the former premier of Quebec. \u201cThe may not like the monarchy or whatever they\u2019d like to read into it, but British institutions have served us very well.\u201d",

      "The Chinese government says the Trump administration\u2019s move to ban international students from Harvard will harm America\u2019s international standing",
      "BANGKOK -- The Chinese government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban international students from Harvard would harm America's international standing, and one university in Hong Kong looked to capitalize on the uncertainty by promising to take them in.",
      "Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard University\u2019s international student population. The university enrolled 6,703 international students across all of its schools in 2024, according to the school\u2019s data, with 1,203 of those coming from China.",
      "The Trump administration's move, announced Thursday, was a hot topic on Chinese social media. State broadcaster CCTV questioned whether the U.S. would remain a top destination for foreign students, noting Harvard was already suing the U.S. government in court.",
      "\u201cBut with the long litigation period, thousands of international students may have trouble waiting,\u201d the CCTV commentary said.",

      "It's been nearly a decade since robbers stormed Kim Kardashian\u2019s luxury residence and tied her up at gunpoint",
      "PARIS -- The Paris robbery of Kim Kardashian lasted only minutes \u2014 but its impact reverberated for nearly a decade.",
      "On Friday, a court in the French capital will decide the verdict in one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history \u2014 the night masked men stormed the star\u2019s luxury apartment, tied her up at gunpoint and vanished into the dark with $6 million in jewels.",
      "Nine men and a woman stand accused of carrying out or aiding the crime during the Paris Fashion Week in 2016, when the robbers, dressed as police, forced their way into the glamorous H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, bound her with zip ties and escaped with her jewelry \u2014 a theft that would force celebrities to rethink how they live and protect themselves.",
      "After delivering final statements in court, the defendants were dismissed Friday morning, with a verdict expected later in the day.",
      "Among them was 69-year-old Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the alleged ringleader, who arrived at court walking with a stick, his face hidden from cameras. Prosecutors have asked for a 10-year sentence. His DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Khedache says he was only a foot soldier. He blamed a mysterious \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 someone prosecutors say never existed.",
      "His lawyer pleaded for clemency, pointing to one of the trial\u2019s most visceral moments \u2014 Kardashian\u2019s earlier courtroom encounter with the man accused of orchestrating her ordeal. Though she wasn't present Friday, her words \u2014 and the memory of that moment \u2014 still echoed.",
      "\u201cShe looked at him when she came, she listened to the letter he had written to her, and then she forgave him,\u201d lawyer Franck Berton told The Associated Press.",
      "Kardashian, typically shielded by security and spectacle, had locked eyes with Khedache as the letter was read aloud.",
      "\u201cI do appreciate the letter, I forgive you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the feelings and the trauma and the fact that my life was forever changed.\u201d A tabloid crime had become something raw and human.",
      "Khedache on Friday asked for \u201ca thousand pardons,\u201d communicated via a written note in court. Other defendants also used their final words to express remorse.",
      "The accused became known in France as \u201cles papys braqueurs\u201d \u2014 the grandpa robbers. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. Some read the proceedings from a screen, hard of hearing and nearly mute. But prosecutors warned observers not to be seduced by soft appearances.",
      "The trial is being heard by a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will need a majority vote to reach a decision.",
      "The defendants face charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and gang association. If convicted, some of them could face life in prison.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony earlier this month was the emotional high point. In a packed courtroom, she recounted how she was thrown onto a bed, zip-tied, and had a gun pressed to her on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.\u201d",
      "She was dragged into a marble bathroom and told to stay silent. When the robbers fled, she freed herself by scraping the tape on her wrists off against the sink, then hid with her friend, shaking and barefoot.",
      "She said that Paris had once been her sanctuary \u2014 a city she would wander at 3 a.m., window shopping, stopping for hot chocolate. That illusion was shattered.",
      "The robbery echoed far beyond the City of Light. It forced a recalibration of celebrity behavior in the age of Instagram. For years, Kardashian had curated her life like a showroom: geo-tagged, diamond-lit, public by design. But this was the moment the showroom turned into a crime scene. In her words, \u201cPeople were watching \u2026 They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she stopped posting her location in real time. She stripped her social media feed of lavish gifts and vanished from Paris for years. Other stars followed suit. Privacy became luxury.",
      "Defense attorneys have asked the court for leniency, citing the defendants\u2019 age and health. But prosecutors insist that criminal experience, not frailty, defined the gang.",
      "Even by the standards of France\u2019s famously deliberate legal system, the case took years to reach trial.",
      "Kardashian, who once said that the experience \u201creally changed everything,\u201d now waits for a verdict \u2014 and perhaps, a final measure of closure.",

      "Shapiro had a pilot\u2019s license and was listed as the owner of the plane that crashed, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The music agency Sound Talent Group confirmed Shapiro died in the Thursday morning crash along with two employees.",
      "\"We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Shapiro cofounded Sound Talent Group in 2018 with Tim Borror and Matt Andersen. The agency\u2019s roster focuses on alternative bands across pop-punk, metalcore, post-hardcore and other popular hard rock subgenres. Clients have included Hanson, Pierce The Veil, Parkway Drive, Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton.",
      "Shapiro was a strong advocate for independent musicians and a co-founder of the National Independent Talent Organization. He was included in Billboard's 2012 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list recognizing rising stars in entertainment. Industry veterans say Shapiro paved the way for the formation of other independent agencies and helped many alternative bands find audiences in the mainstream.",

You\u2019re not just showing up for the paycheck, it\u2019s not a 9-to-5,\u201d he said in a music industry podcast in 2021. \u201cThis is part of living your life if you really love it.\u201d",
      "Shapiro grew up in upstate New York in the \u201cstraightedge hard-core\u201d scene, a subculture that promotes not using drugs and alcohol in reaction to mainstream punk.",
      "In high school, he started a band with his friends and got signed with Victory Records right when they graduated. They toured for a few years, during which he made connections in the music industry that would help his foray into the business side.",
      "Shapiro said he became instantly hooked on aviation after taking his first intro flight at age 22. He seemed to love music and flying with equal passion, at one point opening an office of his talent agency at a hangar in San Diego.",
      "Flying \u201chelps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever\u2019s going on outside the plane kind of doesn\u2019t matter in those moments,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview.",
      "Shapiro owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label, Velocity Records.",
      "He offered flights in both San Diego and Homer, Alaska, where he and his wife, Julia Pawlik Shapiro, owned a home, according to his online posts.",
      "Shapiro married his wife in 2016 in the small town of Talkeetna, Alaska. They picked up their wedding licenses, got on a plane and flew to a glacier inside Denali National Park, landing with skis strapped to the plane\u2019s wheels.",
      "\u201cWhen I met Dave, we became instantly bonded over the unconventional lifestyles we lead and our constant need for adventure,\u201d she wrote in a blog post.",
      "In 2019, he posted on Instagram that he had obtained his airline transport pilot rating, the highest level of certification issued by the U.S.",
      "\u201cAlthough I have a career and don\u2019t plan to change that I always want to learn more and be a better pilot,' he wrote. He was also an adrenaline junkie who enjoyed base-jumping.",
      "Tributes poured in Thursday from musicians and others in the industry who called him warm, genuine and someone who helped little-known bands put their names on the map.",
      "\u201cHe would listen to any band you put in front of him to give them a chance,\u201d said Dayna Ghiraldi-Travers, founder of public relations agency Big Picture Media, who worked with Shapiro for over 15 years.",

      "Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hasn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years",
      "CANNES, France -- Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hadn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "These and other films of Panahi\u2019s premiered to considerable acclaim at international film festivals where the director\u2019s conspicuous absence was sometimes noted by an empty chair. When his last film, 2022\u2019s \u201cNo Bears,\u201d debuted, he was in jail. Only after his hunger strike made worldwide news was Panahi \u2014 who had gone to Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison to inquire about his friend, the then-jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof \u2014 released, in early 2023.",
      "Two years later, with his travel ban finally lifted, Panahi arrived at the Cannes Film Festival with a film, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d riven with the fury and pain of incarceration by the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cBeing here does matter, of course. But what\u2019s even more important is that the film is here,\u201d Panahi said in an interview on a Palais terrace. \u201cEven when I went to jail, I was happy that the film was done. I didn\u2019t mind being in prison because my job was done.\u201d",
      "Yet Panahi\u2019s appearance in Cannes, where the film premiered Tuesday, carries tremendous meaning \u2014 and risk \u2014 for a filmmaker who has played such a massive role in international cinema in absentia. But for a director who has previously had his films smuggled out of Iran on USB drives, risk is a constant for Panahi.",
      "\u201cYes, this is an ongoing risk,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cNow it will probably be higher. But the Iran situation is unpredictable. It changes everyday. New politics everyday. So we have to see what happens the day we go back.\u201d",
      "Last year, in order to reach Cannes, Panahi\u2019s countryman Rasoulof crossed the Iranian border on foot before resettling in Germany. (His film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d was ultimately nominated for best international film at the Oscars.) Panahi says they speak every other day. After the premiere of \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Rasoulof texted Panahi to congratulate him on the moment.",
      "Unlike Rasoulof, though, Panahi \u2014 whose \u201cNo Bears\u201d captured him emotionally gazing across, but not crossing, the border \u2014 has no plans to flee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m flying back to Tehran on Sunday,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "What Panahi does have, as his latest film shows once again, is the ability to deftly lace complicated feelings of resistance, sorrow and hope into gripping movies of elegant, if heartbreaking, composition.",
      "In \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which is in competition for the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasser) believes he sees his former captor and torturer. Though blindfolded while imprisoned, Vahid recognizes the sound of the man's prosthetic leg. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In this strange odyssey, they are all forced to confront revenge or forgiveness for the man who ruined their lives. Panahi drew from his own imprisonment but also from the stories of detainees jailed alongside him.",
      "\u201cIt was the experience of all these people I met in prison, mixed with my own perception and experience,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cFor instance, the fact of never seeing the face of your interrogator is everyone\u2019s experience. But then the people who have spent over a decade in prison have more experience than myself, so I\u2019ve been very sensitive to their narratives.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d may be Panahi\u2019s most politically direct film yet. It\u2019s certainly his most anguished. That\u2019s a product of not just his personal experience in prison but of the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cI think ultimately violence will be inevitable. And it\u2019s exactly what the regime wants, because it gives a justification to the repression,\u201d says Panahi. \u201cThe longer they remain and the more pressure they put on the people, the more the people will feel that they have no other solution. And that\u2019s when it will get dangerous.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Panahi is without hope.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians\u2019 struggle and fight for freedom is extremely precious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat people are doing is so impressive. The regime is just trying to divide us. That\u2019s all they focus on now, to create division between the people.\u201d",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won't allow him to make the films he wants to. So committed is he to making film, he notes that the downside to being able to travel is that he might have to spend a year promoting his film, instead of making the next one. On Thursday, Neon acquired the North American distribution rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do. Maybe if I had other abilities, I would have changed to something else,\u201d Panahi says. \u201cWhen you know that\u2019s the only thing you can do, you find ways. Now, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It was harder at the beginning. There were less people doing underground films. We started this fashion, in a way, so there are ways we have learned and practiced, many of us.\u201d",
      "More than perhaps any filmmaker on earth, you can expect Panahi to find a way to keep making movies, no matter the circumstances.",

      "The music agency Sound Talent Group says three of its employees died on the private plane that crashed into a San Diego neighborhood on Thursday",
      "SAN DIEGO -- A private jet carrying a music talent agent and five others hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, slamming into a home and killing multiple people on the flight.",
      "With the home engulfed in flames and jet fuel rolling down the streets, half a dozen vehicles ignited while residents in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing were shaken awake just before 4 a.m. by the thunderous crash and subsequent explosions. Out their windows, they saw a wall of fire.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,\u201d San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.",
      "No one in the neighborhood died, but eight were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and injuries that were not life-threatening, including a person who was hurt climbing out a window, police officer Anthony Carrasco said.",
      "Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among those killed, the music agency said in a statement. Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and the Canadian rock group Sum 41. Hanson is perhaps best known for its earworm 1990s pop hit, \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Shapiro also owned Velocity Records.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Six people were on board the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities were still combing the scene and recovering the bodies before releasing an official number and identifying the dead, though there were not believed to be any survivors aboard the flight.",
      "Daniel Williams, former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, posted on his Instagram on Wednesday afternoon that he was boarding the plane with Shapiro. The band posted a tribute to Williams on their Instagram page.",
      "\u201cNo words. We owe you everything. Love you forever,\u201d the band wrote.",
      "A representative for the band referred to their social post when asked about Williams\u2019 death.",
      "Parts of Shapiro\u2019s 1985 Cessna 550 Citation littered a large area, including fragments under the power lines and a section of wing on a road behind the homes, said Elliot Simpson of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The home that was struck was destroyed, with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed, and about 10 others were damaged in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country, officials said.",
      "Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them.",
      "\u201cMy wife was screaming, and she\u2019s like, 'There's a fire,'\u201d McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV.",
      "When he walked toward the front of the house, he saw that the roof had fallen off and flames blocked their exit. They grabbed their children and dogs and ran to the back, where their neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape.",
      "The plane also hit both of the couple's vehicles, which burned.",
      "\u201cIt put my truck into our living room,\u201d McCarty said.",
      "Other vehicles along the block were melted and scorched into burned shells. One stubborn car fire sent smoke billowing up for hours.",
      "Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog.",
      "One of the family\u2019s cars was \u201ccompletely disintegrated,\u201d and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris.",
      "\u201cI definitely do feel blessed, because we\u2019ve been spared,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 100 residents were evacuated. Hours after the crash, jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street. The smell of fumes lingered throughout the day, and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.",
      "\u201cWe have jet fuel all over the place,\u201d Assistant San Diego Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy said.",
      "Eddy added that the fog was so thick in the morning that \u201cyou could barely see in front of you.\u201d",
      "The flight took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, near Manhattan, at about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before continuing on to San Diego, according to Simpson.",
      "Based on the flight path, it was bound for Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when it struck power lines about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of the airfield, Simpson said.",
      "Audio recorded by www.liveATC.net includes a brief transmission from the pilot saying he was on final approach to the airport and was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) out at 3:45 a.m.",
      "NTSB investigators planned to spend Thursday and Friday at the scene gathering evidence, Simpson said. He welcomed video or other details from any witnesses.",
      "At that hour and in foggy weather, the plane was likely operating on an instrument flight rules plan, which is typically used during reduced visibility, said Barry Newman, a board-certified aviation attorney.",
      "However, for that airport, once an aircraft reaches 673 feet (205 meters), the pilot also has to rely on sight.",
      "\u201cIf a pilot descends to that level and he can\u2019t see the runway, he has to call for a missed approach or divert to another airport,\u201d Newman said.",
      "In October 2021 a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes. It was preparing to land at the airport.",
      "And in December 2008, a Marine Corps fighter jet slammed into a house in San Diego\u2019s University City neighborhood, causing an explosion that killed four people inside. The Marine Corps blamed the crash on mechanical failure and human error.",

      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering day in early 1952 in Algiers",
      "PARIS -- Decades before transgender became a household word and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d became a worldwide hit \u2014 before visibility brought rights and recognition \u2014 there was Bambi, the Parisian icon who danced for Hollywood.",
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering summer day in early 1950s Algeria. An effeminate teenage boy named Jean-Pierre Pruvot stood mesmerized as traffic halted and crowds swarmed around a scandalous spectacle unfolding in the conservative Algiers streets.",
      "All had stopped to look at Coccinelle, the flamboyant \u201ctransvestite\u201d star of Paris\u2019 legendary cabaret, the Carrousel de Paris, who strutted defiantly down the boulevard, impeccably dressed as a woman, sparking awe and outrage and literally stopping traffic.",
      "What Pruvot \u2014 who would become famous under the female stage name \u201cBambi\u201d and Coccinelle\u2019s best friend \u2014 witnessed was more than mere performance. It was an act of resistance from the ashes of the Nazi persecution of the LGBTQ+ community in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that (identity) existed,\u201d Bambi told The Associated Press in a rare interview. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to do the same.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Carrousel troupe in the late 1940s emerged as a glamorous, audacious resistance. Bambi soon joined Coccinelle, April Ashley, and Capucine in Paris to revive queer visibility in Europe for the first time since the Nazis had violently destroyed Berlin\u2019s thriving queer scene of the 1930s.",
      "The Nazis branded gay men with pink triangles, deported and murdered thousands, erasing queer culture overnight. Just a few years after the war, Carrousel performers strode onto the global stage, a glittering frontline against lingering prejudice.",
      "Remarkably, audiences at the Carrousel knew exactly who these performers were \u2014 women who, as Bambi puts it, \u201cwould bare all.\u201d",
      "Elvis Presley, Ava Gardner, \u00c9dith Piaf, Maria Callas and Marlene Dietrich all flocked to the cabaret, drawn to the allure of performers labeled \u201ctravestis.\u201d The stars sought out the Carrousel to flirt with postwar Paris\u2019s wild side. It was an intoxicating contradiction: cross-dressing was criminalized, yet the venue was packed with celebrities.",
      "The history of queer liberation shifted in this cabaret, one sequin at a time. The contrast was chilling: as Bambi arrived in Paris and found fame dancing naked for film stars, across the English Channel in early 1950s Britain the code-breaking genius Alan Turing was chemically castrated for being gay, leading to his suicide.",
      "Today, Marie-Pierre Pruvot \u2014 as she is also known \u2014 lives alone in an unassuming apartment in northeastern Paris. Her bookshelves spill over with volumes of literature and philosophy. A black feather boa, a lone whisper from her glamorous past, hangs loosely over a chair.",
      "At nearly 90, Bambi is the last of a dying generation. She outlived all her Carrousel sisters \u2014 April Ashley, Capucine, and Coccinelle.",
      "And though the spotlight faded, the legacy still shimmers.",
      "In her heyday, Bambi wasn\u2019t just part of the show; she was the show \u2014 with expressive almond-shaped eyes, pear-shaped face, and beauty indistinguishable from any desired Parisienne. Yet one key difference set her apart \u2014 a difference criminalized by French law.",
      "The depth of her history only becomes apparent as she points to striking and glamorous photographs and recounts evenings spent with legends.",
      "Such was their then-fame that the name of Bambi\u2019s housemate, Coccinelle, became slang for \"trans\" in Israel \u2014 often cruelly.",
      "Once Dietrich, the starry queer icon, arrived at the tiny Madame Arthur cabaret alongside Jean Marais, the actor and Jean Cocteau 's gay lover. \u201cIt was packed,\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cJean Marais instantly said, \u2018Sit (me and Marlene) on stage' And so they were seated onstage, legs crossed, champagne by their side, watching us perform.\u201d",
      "Another day, Dietrich swept in to a hair salon.",
      "\u201cMarlene always had this distant, untouchable air \u2014 except when late for the hairdresser,\u201d Bambi says, smiling. \u201cShe rushed in, kissed the hairdresser, settled beneath the dryer, stretched her long legs imperiously onto a stool, and lit a cigarette. Her gaunt pout as she smoked \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says, her impression exaggerated as she sucked in her cheeks. Perhaps Dietrich wasn\u2019t her favorite star.",
      "Then there was Piaf, who, one evening, teasingly joked about her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the French singing legend Charles Aznavour, performing nearby. \u201cShe asked, \u2018What time does Aznavour start?\u2019\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Midnight.\u2019 So she joked, \u2018Then it\u2019ll be finished by five past midnight.\u2019\"",
      "Behind the glamour lay constant danger. Living openly as a woman was illegal. \u201cThere was a police decree,\u201d Bambi recalls. \u201cIt was a criminal offense for a man to dress as a woman. But if you wore pants and flat shoes, you weren\u2019t considered dressed as a woman.\u201d",
      "The injustice was global. Homosexuality remained criminalized for decades: in Britain until 1967, in parts of the U.S. until 2003. Progress came slowly.",
      "In 1950s Paris, though, Bambi bought hormones casually over-the-counter, \u201clike salt and pepper at the grocery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was much freer then,\u201d but stakes were high, she said.",
      "Sisters were jailed, raped, driven into sex work. One comrade died after botched gender reassignment surgery in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cThere was only Casablanca,\u201d she emphasized, with one doctor performing the high-risk surgeries. Bambi waited cautiously until her best friends, Coccinelle and April Ashley, had safely undergone procedures from the late 50s before doing the same herself.",
      "Each night required extraordinary courage. Post-war Paris was scarred, haunted. The Carrousel wasn\u2019t mere entertainment \u2014 but a one-fingered salute to the past in heels and eyeliner.",
      "\u201cThere was this after-the-war feeling \u2014 people wanted to have fun,\u201d Bambi recalled. With no television, the cabarets were packed every night. \u201cYou could feel it \u2014 people demanded to laugh, to enjoy themselves, to be happy. They wanted to live again \u2026 to forget the miseries of the war.\u201d",
      "In 1974, sensing a shift, Bambi quietly stepped away from celebrity, unwilling to become \u201can aging showgirl.\u201d Swiftly obtaining legal female identity in Algeria, she became a respected teacher and Sorbonne scholar, hiding her dazzling past beneath Marcel Proust and careful anonymity for decades.",
      "Despite what she\u2019s witnessed, or perhaps because of it, she\u2019s remarkably skeptical about recent controversies around gender. This transgender pioneer feels wokeism has moved too quickly, fueling a backlash.",
      "She sees U.S. President Donald Trump as part of \u201ca global reaction against wokeism\u2026 families aren\u2019t ready\u2026 we need to pause and breathe a little before moving forward again.\u201d",
      "Inclusive pronouns and language \u201ccomplicate the language,\u201d she insists. Asked about author J.K. Rowling\u2019s anti-trans stance, her response is calmly dismissive: \u201cHer opinion counts no more than a baker\u2019s or a cleaning lady\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Bambi still stands \u2014 proud, elegant, unbowed \u2014 in a life spanning World War II to \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d",
      "When she first stepped onstage, the world had no words for someone like her. So she danced anyway. Today, the words exist. So do the rights. And the movements she helped inspire.",
      "\u201cI never wore a mask,\u201d she says softly, but firmly. \u201cExcept when I was a boy.\u201d",

      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his status as a power broker to abuse women.",

      "The Cleveland born-and-raised, skinny-jean wearing, Grammy Award-winning rapper has long been celebrated for his alternative hip-hop, emotional music that effortlessly weaves genres together in surprising ways.",
      "Music blogs and other tastemakers quickly caught on to Cudi's 2007 single, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite,\u201d with its unique singsong style that later appeared on his blockbuster 2009 debut, \u201cMan on the Moon: The End of the Day\u201d as \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite (Nightmare).\" The album's hits included \u201cPursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)\u201d and is easily one of the most influential rap records of the last two decades. In September, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite\u201d was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.",
      "Cudi began as something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West, when the then-uncontroversial rapper signed Cudi to his G.O.O.D. Music label in 2008. Cudi left in 2013.",
      "He is featured on Jay-Z's \u201cThe Blueprint 3\u201d and West's landmark \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d Cudi has always had an eye and ear toward innovation.

      "Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, has been the trial\u2019s central witness with her accounts of years of violence and sexual abuse.",
      "She testified that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi in 2011 to work on music. The two began dating soon after, and she said she got a burner phone to communicate with Cudi in secret.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in sex parties that Combs orchestrated. It was during one of these that Combs looked at her phone and learned of the Cudi relationship, Cassie testified.",

      "A leading medical group is warning of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country",
      "CAIRO -- A leading medical group warned on Tuesday of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country, and said its teams have treated hundreds of patients in the region of the capital, Khartoum.",
      "Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF \u2014 said that the alarming spike began in mid-May, with Khartoum's twin city, Omdurman, as the epicenter.",
      "She said MSF treated almost 2,000 suspected cholera cases in the past week alone. There were no immediate official figures of fatalities from cholera in this latest outbreak, though an aid worker said he was told on Monday of 12 people dying of cholera.",
      "In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan\u2019s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.",
      "Sudan plunged into war more than two years ago, when tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group, or RSF, exploded with battles in Khartoum and across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher, and the African nation has been engulfed by what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.",
      "More than 14 million people have been displaced and forced from their homes and disease outbreaks, famine and atrocities have mounted as the country entered its third year of war.",
      "Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said on Saturday that the recent increase in cholera cases is estimated to average 600 to 700 per week, over the past four weeks.",
      "He attributed the surge to the return of many Sudanese to the Khartoum region \u2014 people who had fled their homes to escape the fighting and who are now coming back. Their returns have strained the city's dwindling water resources, he said.",
      "Last week, the Sudanese military said it had regained control of the Greater Khartoum area from the paramilitary forces.",
      "On Monday, Mohanad Elbalal, co-founder of the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, said he was told that 12 people had died of cholera in Omdurman, including a relative of one of his kitchen staff.",
      "Bakker, the MSF coordinator, said Tuesday that the group's treatment centers in Omdurman are overwhelmed and that the \u201cscenes are disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany patients are arriving too late to be saved,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture.\u201d",
      "She called for a united response, including water, sanitation and hygiene programs and more treatment facilities.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament adopted a bill Tuesday to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "The National Assembly vote is a key step on the long-debated issue, though others remain before the bill can become law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of all the patients and their loved ones that I\u2019ve met over more than a decade. Many are no longer here, and they always told me: Keep fighting,\" said Olivier Falorni, the bill's general rapporteur, amid applause from fellow lawmakers.",
      "The proposed measure on lethal medication defines assisted dying as allowing use under certain conditions so that people may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it. A definitive vote on the measure could take months to be scheduled amid France\u2019s long and complex process. The National Assembly has final say over the Senate.",
      "Activists have criticized the complexity and length of the parliamentary process that they say is penalizing patients waiting for end-of-life options.",
      "In parallel, another bill on palliative care meant to reinforce measures to relieve pain and preserve patients\u2019 dignity was also adopted Tuesday, unanimously.",
      "To benefit, patients would need to be over 18 and be French citizens or live in France.",
      "A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness \u201cat an advanced or terminal stage,\u201d is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will.",
      "Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease won\u2019t be eligible.",
      "The person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection. If approved, a doctor would deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home or at a nursing home or a health care facility.",
      "A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalizing end-of-life options, and opinion polls show growing support over the past 20 years.",
      "Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",
      "\u201cWhat a long road it has been, contrary to what the public thought, contrary to what the French people believed,\u201d said Jonathan Denis, president of the Association for the Right to Die With Dignity (ADMD).",
      "Earlier this month, Macron suggested he could ask French voters to approve the measure via referendum if parliament discussions get off track.",
      "Macron on Tuesday called the vote an important step, adding on social media that \"with respect for different sensibilities, doubts, and hopes, the path of fraternity I had hoped for is gradually beginning to open. With dignity and humanity.\u201d",
      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "\u201cI cannot accept that French men and women have to go to Switzerland \u2014 if they can afford it \u2014 or to Belgium to be supported in their choice, or that French men and women are being accompanied clandestinely in other countries,\" Denis said.",
      "French religious leaders this month issued a joint statement to denounce the bill, warning about the dangers of an \u201canthropological rupture.\u201d The Conference of Religious Leaders in France (CRCF), which represents the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist communities, said the proposed measures risk exerting pressure on older people and those with illnesses or disabilities.",
      "Assisted suicide is allowed in Switzerland and several U.S. states. Euthanasia is currently legal in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Belgium and Luxembourg under certain conditions.",

      "Haitians with HIV are defying stigma as they publicly denounce USAID cuts implemented by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that has led to a dwindling of life-saving medication",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A video showing dozens of people marching toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister elicited gasps from some viewers as it circulated recently on social media. The protesters, who were HIV positive, did not conceal their faces \u2014 a rare occurrence in a country where the virus is still heavily stigmatized.",
      "\u201cCall the minister of health! We are dying!\u201d the group chanted.",
      "The protesters risked being shunned by society to warn that Haiti is running out of HIV medication just months after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump slashed more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall aid across the globe.",
      "At a hospital near the northern city of Cap-Haitien, Dr. Eugene Maklin said he struggles to share that reality with his more than 550 HIV patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to them, to tell them that they\u2019re not going to find medication,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a suicide.\u201d",
      "More than 150,000 people in Haiti have HIV or AIDS, according to official estimates, although nonprofits believe the number is much higher.",
      "David Jeune, a 46-year-old hospital community worker, is among them. He became infected 19 years ago after having unprotected sex. \u201cI was scared to let people know because they would point their finger at you, saying you are infecting others with AIDS,\u201d he said.",
      "His fear was so great that he didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even his mother. But that fear dissipated with the support Jeune said he received from nonprofits. His confidence grew to the point where he participated in Monday\u2019s protest.",
      "\u201cI hope Trump will change his mind,\u201d he said, noting that his medication will run out in November. \u201cLet the poor people get the medication they need.\u201d",
      "Patrick Jean No\u00ebl, a representative of Haiti\u2019s Federation of Associations of HIV, said that at least five clinics, including one that served 2,500 patients, were forced to close after the USAID funding cuts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay silent,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people need to come out.\u201d",
      "But most people with HIV in Haiti are reluctant to do so, said Dr. Sabine Lustin, executive director of the Haiti-based nonprofit Promoters of Zero AIDS Goal.",
      "The stigma is so strong that many patients are reluctant to pick up their medication in person. Instead, it is sent via packages wrapped as gifts to not arouse suspicion, Lustin said.",
      "Lustin\u2019s organization, which helps some 2,000 people across Haiti, receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While their funding hasn\u2019t been cut, she said that shortly after Trump was sworn in, the agency banned prevention activities because they targeted a group that is not a priority. By that, Lustin said she understood they were referring to gay men.",
      "That means the organization can no longer distribute up to 200,000 free condoms a year or educate people about the disease.",
      "\u201cYou risk an increase in infections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a young population who is sexually active who can\u2019t receive the prevention message and don\u2019t have access to condoms.\u201d",
      "On a recent sunny morning, a chorus of voices drowned out the din of traffic in Haiti\u2019s capital, growing louder as protesters with HIV marched defiantly toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell the government that we exist, and we are people like any other person,\u201d one woman told reporters.",
      "Another marching alongside her said, \u201cWithout medication, we are dying. This needs to change.\u201d",
      "Three days after Monday's protest, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, announced that he had met with activists and would try to secure funding.",
      "Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations across Haiti are fretting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Marie Denis-Luque, founder and executive director of CHOAIDS, a nonprofit that cares for Haitian orphans with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe only have medication until July.\u201d",
      "Her voice broke as she described her frantic search for donations for the orphans, who are cared for by HIV-positive women in Cap-Haitien after gang violence forced them to leave Port-au-Prince.",
      "Denis-Luque said she has long advocated for the orphans\u2019 visibility.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding these children. They are part of society,\u201d she said, adding that she smiled when she saw the video of Monday\u2019s protest. \u201cI was like, whoa, things have changed tremendously. The stigma is real, but I think what I saw \u2026 was very encouraging to me. They can\u2019t be silenced.\u201d",
      "Experts say Haiti could see a rise in HIV infections because medications are dwindling at a time that gang violence and poverty are surging.",
      "Dr. Alain Casseus, infectious disease division chief at Zamni Lasante, the largest non-governmental healthcare provider in Haiti, said they expected to see a surge in patients given the funding cuts, but that hasn\u2019t happened because traveling by land in Haiti is dangerous since violent gangs control main roads and randomly open fire on vehicles.",
      "He warned that abruptly stopping medication is dangerous, especially because many Haitians do not have access or cannot afford nutritious food to strengthen their immune system.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long, especially given the situation in Haiti, to enter a very bad phase,\u201d he said of HIV infections. And even if some funding becomes available, a lapse in medication could cause resistance to it, he said.",
      "Casseus said gang violence also could accelerate the rates of infection via rapes or physical violence as medication runs out.",
      "At the New Hope Hospital run by Maklin in Haiti\u2019s northern region, shelves are running empty. He used to receive more than $165,000 a year to help HIV/AIDS patients. But that funding has dried up.",
      "\u201cThose people are going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or where we\u2019re going to get more medication.\u201d",
      "The medication controls the infection and allows many to have an average life expectancy. Without it, the virus attacks a person\u2019s immune system, and they develop AIDS, the late stage of an HIV infection.",
      "Reaction is swift when Dr. Maklin tells his patients that in two months, the hospital won\u2019t have any HIV medication left.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to keep living.\u201d",

Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",

      "Reproductive rights advocates are suing Arizona to unravel several laws regulating abortion access in the state",
      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Thursday to unravel several laws regulating abortion in the state.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by two providers in the state and the Arizona Medical Association. It comes more than six months after voters enshrined in the state constitution access to abortions up to fetal viability, which is the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.",
      "The advocates are seeking to undo laws including those that bar abortions sought based on genetic abnormalities, require informed consent in-person at least 24 hours before the procedure and offer an opportunity to view the ultrasound, and prohibit abortion medication delivered by mail and the use of tele-health for abortion care.",
      "\u201cThese stigmatizing and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions violate the right to reproductive freedom established by Arizona voters last November, and it\u2019s time for them to go,\u201d Rebecca Chan, staff attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \u201cArizonans are perfectly capable of making decisions about their own reproductive futures.\"",
      "The state attorney general's office is reviewing the complaint, and an agency spokesperson noted that state law should be in line with the amendment approved by voters last November. Arizona was one of a handful of states that passed ballot measures in the 2024 general election enshrining the right to abortion to their state constitutions.",
      "Earlier this year, an Arizona judge blocked the state's 15-week abortion ban.",
      "Peter Gentala, president of Center for Arizona Policy, a socially conservative nonprofit, said it is too early to determine if the organization will intervene in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWomen\u2019s health is important and this lawsuit reflects an agenda to maximize abortion in Arizona and that comes at a cost to women\u2019s health,\u201d he said.",

      "It would require many low-income adults to work to receive Medicaid health insurance coverage and more to work to get food assistance, require hospitals to verify the citizenship status of patients, and cut funding for services like birth control to the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Supporters of the bill say the moves will save money, root out waste and encourage personal responsibility.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "The measure, which also includes tax cuts, passed the House by one vote and could have provisions reworked again as it heads to the Senate.",
      "Here's a look at the potential impact.",
      "Starting next year, many able-bodied Medicaid enrollees will be required to show that they work in exchange for the health insurance coverage.",
      "While about 92% of people enrolled now meet the requirement, roughly 5 million would likely lose their coverage, according to previous estimates of an earlier version of the bill provided by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Increased eligibility checks and red tape related to work requirements may result in some people wrongly getting booted off, said Eduardo Conrado, the president of Ascension, a health care system that operates hospitals across 10 states.",
      "That could spell trouble for rural hospitals, in particular, who will see their small pool of patients go from paying for their emergency care with Medicaid coverage to not paying anything at all. Hospitals could have to eat their costs.",
      "\u201cAdding work requirements is not just a policy change, it\u2019s a shift away from the purpose of the program,\u201d Conrado said of the rule.",
      "Only Arkansas has had a work requirement that kicks people off for noncompliance. More than 18,000 lost coverage after it kicked in in 2018, and the programs was later blocked by federal courts.",
      "Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, said work requirements do not result in more people having jobs \u2014 but in fewer people having health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you lose your job going forward, good luck to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a good chance you\u2019re going to be uninsured because of this bill.\u201d",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, already requires work for some of its roughly 42 million recipients. Adults ages 18-54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents must work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month, or else be limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation passed by the House would raise the work requirement to age 65 and also extend it to parents without children younger than age 7. The bill also would limit the ability to waive work requirements in areas with unemployment rates significantly above the national average.",
      "The combination of those changes could put 6 million adults at risk of losing SNAP benefits, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Like work requirements for Medicaid, those for SNAP tend to cause a decrease in participation without increasing employment, according to an April report by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project.",
      "Under the bill, the federal government would punish states that use their own state dollars to provide Medicaid-covered services to immigrants lacking legal status or to provide subsidies to help them buy health insurance.",
      "Some states that provide that sort of coverage extend it only to children.",
      "Those states would see federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population \u2014 typically low-income adults \u2014 drop from 90% to 80%.",
      "That could mean states pull back that Medicaid coverage to avoid the federal penalty.",
      "\u201cIf that penalty of 10% is imposed, we would expect that states will have to drop that coverage,\u201d said Georgetown's Alker.",

      "Planned Parenthood says a provision barring it from receiving Medicaid funds could lead to about one-third of its health centers closing.",
      "The group said about 200 centers are at risk \u2014 most of them in states where abortion is legal. In those states, the number of Planned Parenthood centers could be cut in half.",
      "Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, also offers other health services, including birth control and cancer screening.",
      "Federal money was already barred from paying for abortion, but state Medicaid funds in some states now cover it.",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That has big implications for the fall vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "The FDA deflected questions about the new policy at Thursday's meeting to decide whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. The committee\u2019s recommendation is nonbinding guidance ahead of an agency decision.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "With JN.1 descendants still dominating worldwide, Pfizer and Moderna representatives told panelists Thursday that their current vaccines remain effective, although switching to a newer subtype, LP.8.1, could provide even more protection. Novavax said sticking with the parent strain JN.1 \u2014 the company\u2019s current vaccine formula \u2014 might be best.",
      "The challenge for regulators is there's no way to predict how the virus will evolve by the time fall vaccinations begin.",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued guidance that last year's version remained OK but that vaccine-makers could also choose an update. A representative for the organization told FDA panelists that current data on the COVID-19's continuing evolution might not yet warrant switching to a newer subtype. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency recently recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "While demand for vaccinations has dropped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 30,000 to 50,000 adults have died from COVID-19 since October. The virus continues to cause \u201cenormous burden\u201d on the health care system, CDC\u2019s Dr. Fiona Havers told panelists. Older adults count for most hospitalizations and deaths but COVID-19 also is \u201ca major cause of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d especially in children under 2 -- many of whom had no underlying medical problems before their infections.",
      "The strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The CDC's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "CDC staffers presented real-world data Thursday showing that getting a booster last fall offered added protection even in people who had been infected and previously vaccinated. Company studies reached the same conclusion \u2014 including one by Moderna that compared medical records of about 900,000 people.",

      "Erdogan, who has led Turkey as president since 2014 and was prime minister for more than a decade before that, has advocated for a new constitution arguing that the current one, which was drafted following a military coup in 1980, is outdated and retains elements of military influence even though it was amended several times.",
      "\u201cAs of yesterday, I have assigned 10 legal experts to begin their work, and with this effort, we will proceed with the preparations for the new constitution,\u201d Erdogan told his ruling party\u2019s local administrators in a speech. \u201cFor 23 years, we have repeatedly demonstrated our sincere intention to crown our democracy with a new civilian and libertarian constitution.\u201d",
      "Under the current constitution, Erdogan cannot run again unless early elections are called or the legal framework is changed. Critics see the push for a new constitution as a possible path for re-election, allowing legal changes that would bypass the constitutional term limits.",

      "A Swedish man has been indicted as a member of the Islamic State group in connection with the killing of a Jordanian pilot whose plane went down in Syria on Christmas Eve 2014",
      "A Swedish man was indicted Tuesday in connection with the killing by the Islamic State group of a Jordanian pilot whose plane went down in Syria on Christmas Eve 2014, prosecutors said.",
      "The 26-year-old Jordanian, 1st Lt. Mu\u2019ath al-Kaseasbeh, was taken captive after his F-16 fighter jet crashed near the extremists\u2019 de facto capital of Raqqa in northern Syria. He was forced into a cage that was set on fire, killing him on camera in early 2015.",
      "The suspect was identified by Swedish prosecutors as Osama Krayem, 32, who is alleged to have traveled to Syria in September 2014 to fight for IS.",
      "The airman became the first known foreign military pilot to fall into the militants\u2019 hands after the U.S.-led international coalition began its aerial campaign against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq in 2014. Jordan, a close U.S. ally, was a member of the coalition and the pilot\u2019s killing appeared aimed at pressuring the government of Jordan to leave the alliance.",
      "Krayem is set to go on trial June 4 in Stockholm. He was previously convicted in France and Brussels for fatal Islamic State attacks in those countries.",
      "In a 20-minute video released in 2015, purportedly showing al-Kaseasbeh's killing, he displayed signs of having been beaten, including a black eye. Toward the end of the clip, he is shown wearing an orange jumpsuit. He stands in an outdoor cage as a masked militant ignites a line of fuel leading to it.",
      "The footage was widely released as part of the militant group's propaganda.",
      "The killing sparked outrage and anti-IS demonstrations in Jordan, and King Abdullah II ordered two al-Qaida prisoners to be executed in response.",
      "In 2022, Krayem was among 20 men convicted by a special terrorism court in Paris for involvement in a wave of Islamic State attacks in the French capital in 2015, targeting the Bataclan theater, Paris caf\u00e9s and the national stadium. The assaults killed 130 people and injured hundreds, some permanently maimed.",
      "Krayem was sentenced to 30 years in prison, for charges including complicity to terrorist murder. French media reported that France agreed in March to turn Krayem over to Sweden for nine months, to assist with the Swedish probe and his expected trial.",
      "Sweden is then to return him to France so he can serve out his sentence, French media reported.",
      "In 2023, a Belgian court sentenced Krayem, among others, to life in prison on charges of terrorist murder in connection with 2016 suicide bombings that killed 32 people and wounded hundreds at Brussels airport and a busy subway station, the country\u2019s deadliest peacetime attack.",
      "Krayem was aboard the commuter train that was hit, but did not detonate the explosives he was carrying.",
      "Both the Paris and Brussels attacks were linked to the same Islamic State network.",
      "Krayem grew up in Rosengard, a district notorious in Sweden for high crime and unemployment rates where more than 80 percent of the residents are first- or second-generation immigrants.",
      "\u201cHe was well-known to the local police for multiple criminal activities like thefts, for instance,\u201d Muhammad Khorshid, who ran a program in Rosengard to help immigrants integrate into Swedish society, told The Associated Press in 2016.",
      "He said Krayem \u201cwas the perfect target for radicalization \u2014 no job, no future, no money.\u201d",
      "Krayem had posted photos on social media from Syria, including one where he posed with an assault rifle in front of the black flag of the Islamic State group.",
      "At its peak, IS ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom in Iraq and Syria and was notorious for its brutality \u2014 much of it directed against fellow Sunni Muslims as well as against those the group deemed to be heretics. It beheaded civilians, slaughtered 1,700 captured Iraqi soldiers in a short period, and enslaved and raped thousands of women from the Yazidi community, one of Iraq\u2019s oldest religious minorities.",
      "In March 2019, the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the the last sliver of land the extremists controlled in the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz. While IS has lost its hold on all of the territory it once controlled, sleeper cells still stage occasional attacks in Iraq and Syria and abroad.",
      "Also on Tuesday, the German federal prosecutor separately announced the arrest of an alleged member of the Syrian secret intelligence services under former Syrian President Bashar Assad. The suspect, who was only named as Fahad A. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested on suspicion of acts of killing, torture, and deprivation of liberty as crimes against humanity.",
      "He allegedly took part in more than 100 interrogations between late April 2011 and mid-April 2012. At least 70 prisoners died from the torture and prison conditions, the federal prosecutor's office said.",

      "Poland is set to hold a presidential runoff election in which a right-wing nationalist and a pro-European liberal are running neck-and neck",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland is set to hold a presidential runoff election on Sunday, with a right-wing nationalist and a pro-European liberal running neck-and-neck in a race that could shape the future of one of NATO's and the European Union\u2019s most strategically important member states.",
      "The vote comes amid heightened regional tensions driven by Russia\u2019s war in neighboring Ukraine, security concerns across Europe and internal debates about the rule of law.",
      "The winner will replace conservative incumbent Andrzej Duda, whose second term expires this summer. Most political power in Poland lies with a government led by a prime minister and parliament, but the president holds the power to veto laws and influences foreign policy.",
      "Sunday\u2019s vote follows a first round on May 18, in which Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski won 31.36% of the vote and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian, earned 29.54%. Eleven other candidates were eliminated.",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian with no political experience who is not even a party member, was tapped by Law and Justice as part of a push for a fresh start.",
      "Law and Justice governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.",
      "Nawrocki currently heads the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland. Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump, who met Nawrocki this month at the White House, released photos of the meeting. Nawrocki said Trump predicted his victory.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Many oppose abortion and LGBTQ+ visibility and say Nawrocki reflects the traditional values they grew up with.",
      "A common refrain from his supporters is that Nawrocki will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags appear at his rallies.",
      "Nawrocki performed better in the first round than expected, an indication he was underestimated in the polling. But his quick political rise has not been without controversy, with reports of links to underworld figures whom he met while boxing or working as a hotel security guard in the past.",
      "Nawrocki has also been linked to a scandal involving the acquisition of a Gdansk apartment from an elderly pensioner named Jerzy. Allegations suggest Nawrocki promised to care for Jerzy in return but failed to fulfill the commitment, leading the man to end up in a publicly funded retirement home.",
      "His shifting explanations have raised questions about his transparency and credibility. After the scandal erupted he donated the apartment to a charity.",
      "It recently emerged Nawrocki took part in a 2009 Gdansk hooligan brawl involving about 140 rival football fans, some later convicted of crimes. Nawrocki described the fight as a form of \u201cnoble\" combat.",
      "His behavior during a presidential debate on Friday also generated a lot of discussion. At one point during the debate, while Trzaskowski spoke about plans for senior care, Nawrocki covered his mouth with one hand and put something in his mouth. He first said it was gum, but later said it was a nicotine pouch.",
      "His critics say all of these things make him unfit to represent Poland as the head of state. His supporters dismiss the allegations as politically motivated, and it is not clear if any of the allegations will hurt him.",
      "Trzaskowski, 53, is Warsaw\u2019s mayor and a close ally of Prime Minister Donald Tusk. A deputy leader of the pro-EU Civic Platform, he has been prominent in national politics for years. This is his second presidential bid after narrowly losing to Duda in 2020.",
      "Supporters credit him with modernizing Warsaw through infrastructure, public transit expansion and cultural investments. He is widely seen as pro-European, pragmatic and focused on aligning Poland more closely with EU norms, especially on democratic governance and judicial independence.",
      "Fluent in several foreign languages including English and French, he is praised by supporters but mocked by opponents, who see those skills as a sign of elitism and taunt him with the nickname \u201cBonjour\u201d at right-wing rallies.",
      "His right-wing critics accusing him of being willing to sell out Poland's sovereignty to the EU and embracing green economic policies, which they believe are harmful to Poland's traditional reliance on coal as an energy source.",
      "His open support for LGBTQ+ rights, including appearances at Pride parades, has made him a polarizing figure in conservative and rural areas. His conservative critics feel he is out of touch with traditional Polish values and say his administration has mismanaged aspects of Warsaw\u2019s real estate and budget.",
      "Voter fatigue is another challenge. Some centrist and progressive voters have expressed disappointment with the Tusk government\u2019s failure to deliver on key promises, particularly on easing Poland\u2019s near-total abortion ban.",
      "Trzaskowski has sought to reinvigorate that base, leading a major Warsaw rally on Sunday that aimed to mobilize voters.",
      "He has framed the election as a choice between a European future and authoritarian nationalism. His campaign stresses democratic institutions, EU cooperation and women\u2019s rights, messages that resonate more in cities than in rural areas.",

      "France\u2019s lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, is to vote on a bill meant to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demand grows across Europe for legal end-of-life options",
      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, is voting Tuesday on a bill to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "Tuesday's vote, expected in the late afternoon, is a key legislative step on the contentious and long-debated issue. If approved by a majority of lawmakers, the bill will be sent to the Senate for further debate.",
      "The proposed measure defines assisted dying as allowing people to use a lethal substance under certain conditions so that they may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "To benefit from the newly proposed measure, patients would need to be over 18 and be French citizens or live in France.",
      "A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness \u201cat an advanced or terminal stage,\u201d is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain, and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will.",
      "Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease won\u2019t be eligible.",
      "The person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection.",
      "If approved, a doctor would then deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home, at a nursing home or a health care facility.",
      "In parallel, another bill on palliative care meant to reinforce measures to relieve pain and preserve patients' dignity will also be put to a vote Tuesday.",
      "A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalizing end-of-life options, and opinion polls show growing support over the past 20 years. Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",
      "A definitive vote on the measure could take months to be scheduled amid France\u2019s long and complex legislative process. The National Assembly has the final say over the Senate.",
      "Earlier this month, Macron suggested he could ask for French voters to approve the measure via referendum if parliament discussions get off track.",
      "Activists supporting the change have criticized the complexity and length of the parliamentary process that they say is penalizing patients waiting for end-of-life options.",
      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",
      "The Association for the Right to Die with Dignity (ADMD) has called on French lawmakers \u201cto respect the French who want the same right that our Dutch, Belgian, Luxembourgian, Swiss, Spanish, Portuguese neighbors have.\u201d",
      "French religious leaders issued this month a joint statement to denounce the bill, warning about the \u201cdangers\u201d of an \u201canthropological rupture.\u201d The Conference of Religious Leaders in France (CRCF), which represents the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist communities, said the proposed measures risk exerting pressure on older people and those with illnesses or disabilities.",
      "The debate in France comes as similar talks are ongoing in the U.K., where lawmakers are debating a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales after giving it initial approval in November.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication that has been prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "Assisted suicide is allowed in Switzerland and several U.S. states. Euthanasia is currently legal in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Belgium and Luxembourg under certain conditions.",

      "A Ukrainian official says Russian forces have taken over four border villages in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Sumy region",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces have taken four border villages in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Sumy region, a local official said Tuesday, days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had issued an order to establish a buffer zone along the border.",
      "Sumy borders Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where a surprise Ukrainian incursion last year captured a pocket of land in the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II. Creating a buffer zone could help Russia prevent further Ukrainian cross-border attacks there.",
      "Meanwhile, a Russian bombing campaign that had escalated in recent days slowed overnight as far fewer Russian drones targeted Ukrainian towns and cities.",
      "Moscow's invasion has shown no signs of stopping despite months of intense U.S.-led efforts to secure a ceasefire and get traction for peace talks. Since Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Turkey earlier this month for their first direct talks in three years, a large prisoner exchange has been the only tangible outcome, but negotiations have brought no significant breakthrough.",
      "Between Friday and Sunday, Russia launched around 900 drones at Ukraine, officials said, amid a spate of large-scale bombardments. On Sunday night, Russia launched its biggest drone attack of the 3-year war against Ukraine, firing 355 drones.",
      "From Monday to Tuesday, Russia fired 60 drones at Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said Tuesday. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense claimed its air defenses downed 99 Ukrainian drones overnight over seven Russian regions.",
      "The weekend surge in Russia's bombardments of Ukraine drew a rebuke from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said Putin had gone \u201ccrazy.\u201d That comment prompted a sharp Kremlin reaction Monday, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticizing \u201demotional reactions\u201d to events.",
      "Peskov adopted a milder tone Tuesday, hailing U.S. peace efforts and saying that \u201cthe Americans and President Trump have taken a quite balanced approach.\u201d",
      "In Sumy, Russian forces are trying to advance deeper after capturing villages, Oleh Hryhorov, head of the Sumy regional military administration, said in a statement.",
      "Ukrainian forces are endeavoring to hold the line, he said. Residents of the captured villages were evacuated earlier, and there is no immediate threat to civilians, Hryhorov said.",
      "Putin visited the Kursk region last week for the first time since Moscow claimed last month that it drove Ukrainian forces out of the area where they captured land last August. Kyiv officials have denied the claim.",
      "The long border remains vulnerable to Ukrainian incursions, Putin said. He said he told the Russian military to create a \u201csecurity buffer zone\u201d along the border but provided no public details of where the proposed zone would be or how far it would stretch.",
      "Putin said a year ago that a Russian offensive at the time aimed to create a buffer zone in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region. That could have helped protect Russia\u2019s Belgorod border region, where frequent Ukrainian attacks have embarrassed the Kremlin.",

      "Thomas Parker, from Cumbria in northwest England, was arrested Jan. 21 at a villa near Kuta beach, a popular tourist spot, after he allegedly collected a package containing drugs from a motorcycle taxi driver on a nearby street.",
      "Police officers said Parker was \u201cacting suspiciously\u201d while he collected the package, according to the court document. He allegedly discarded it in a panic and fled when police approached him. He was traced back to the villa where he was staying and arrested.",
      "A lab test confirmed the package contained slightly over a kilogram (2.326 pounds) of MDMA, the main ingredient in ecstasy, the document said.",
      "During the police investigation, the 32-year-old electrician was able to prove that he did not order the package. It was sent by a drug dealer friend, identified only as Nicky, whom Parker had known for around two years and spoke to regularly through the Telegram messaging app.",
      "Parker was told someone would pick it up shortly from him, and he was not promised money or anything else by Nicky in return.",
      "Police reduced the initial charge of drug trafficking, which carries a possible death sentence, to the less serious offense of hiding information from authorities after investigators determined that the package was not directly linked to him.",
      "During the trial, which began last month at the Denpasar District Court, Parker told the court he initially refused to collect the package but agreed to do it after Nicky assured him the package was safe and would not put him in danger.",
      "Prosecutors on May 6 sought a one-year prison term for Parker, but the judges said they reduced the penalty because Parker regretted his acts, had not been previously convicted and promised to reform.",
      "Parker sat silently as a panel of three judges at Denpasar District Court handed down the punishment. The judges also ordered the time he has already served since he was arrested to be deducted from his sentence, meaning he will be free in several months.",

      "\u201cI believe the ASEAN-GCC partnership has never been more important than it is today, as we navigate an increasingly complex global landscape marked by economic uncertainty and geopolitical challenges,\u201d Anwar said.",

      "ASEAN has maintained a policy of neutrality, engaging both Beijing and the United States, but U.S. President Donald Trump's threats sweeping tariffs came as a blow. Six of the bloc's members were among the worst hit, with tariffs between 32% and 49%.",
      "Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs in April for most of the world, and this month struck a similar deal with key rival China, easing trade war tensions. Anwar is seeking an ASEAN summit with Trump on the tariffs.",

      "While relying on U.S. defense support, ASEAN is increasing reliance and partnership with China and other U.S. rivals, Chong said.",
      "\u201cIf this continues under the current Trump administration, it will create further room for Washington to distance itself from the region, which will spell disaster and create an even deeper Chinese presence,\u201d he said.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Marcelo Colai\u00e1covo was driving to his bar in Downtown Sao Paulo on a recent May afternoon when he noticed something unusual: the hundreds of drug users that for years roamed around the neighborhood were all gone. He walked around for 10 minutes finding no trace of them. Also gone was the stench of their waste being cleaned by city hall staffers.",
      "\u201cI felt this strange peace,\u201d said the 42-year-old Sao Paulo resident. \u201cEveryone had disappeared. But how come?\u201d",
      "Colai\u00e1covo's bar-museum is located in one of the edges of Cracolandia, or Crackland, a sprawling downtown Sao Paulo area that for decades has been home to thousands of drug users, often lying on the ground or jaywalking with pipes between their lips.",
      "But by May 12 the scene had changed.",
      "Only police officers were seen where crack users dominated for decades. Shop owners and residents who worried about muggings were chatting outside. Pavement that until recently featured scattered shoes, single socks, broken pipes and, sometimes, feces seemed spotless. The makeshift shelters, made of cardboard and fabric, were gone, and some of the graffiti on deteriorated buildings of Crackland, once a backdrop to the human drama, can finally be seen.",
      "The transformation that stationed police officers in the area and scared residents into other parts of the city is the result of an aggressive local government initiative to change the region for good.",
      "Experts caution, however, that the cleanup carried significant costs: police brutality, the spread of security risks to other areas and the neglect of treatment and protection to drug users, who are not criminals. Instead, they say, Crackland residents have only scattered and will inevitably return.",
      "Residents told The Associated Press that police aggression has escalated since earlier this year under Gov. Tarcisio de Freitas and Mayor Ricardo Nunes. They say officers more frequently are using batons, preventing them from carrying bags where drugs could be hidden, closing several local pensions and even threatening to kill them. About a fourth of neighboring slum, where drug traffickers are reportedly based, has been removed.",
      "Nearly two weeks after drug users vanished from the main Crackland area, hundreds have been spotted in smaller pockets around Sao Paulo's old city center. Social media videos show some attempting to return at night to their former drug use spot, now a 24/7 police-protected area. But all attempts have failed.",
      "Many hope to soon return to the area they occupied for decades \u2014 provided police brutality wanes and authorities lose their grip of the region, as has happened in the past.",
      "\u201cMy guitar is in the mud because of a criminal wearing blue,\" said Rog\u00e9rio, a tearful man in a dirty shirt and yoga pants, who didn't provide his surname due to fear of retribution. \"I have nothing against the law. But the law has to understand we live there. Now we have to roam, it's horrible. We can't enter where we lived, we can\u2019t even carry a blanket.\u201d",
      "Crackland is located in what was once part of Sao Paulo\u2019s old city center. The decline of the region began in the 1960s, as business moved to Paulista Avenue, a more central artery, and industries relocated to the cheaper outskirts. For about two decades, until the mid 1980s, low budget film companies moved in, earning the region the nickname of \u201cGarbage Mouth.\u201d Drug users first arrived about three decades ago.",
      "Brazilian researchers say Crackland emerged in the 1990s due to a confluence of two factors: the proximity of a major transportation hub, encompassing buses, subways and trains, and widespread mass killings in the city\u2019s most impoverished districts, which forced residents to congregate in the downtown\u2019s most dilapidated sector.",
      "For much of the last 30 years, shop owners and residents feared being mugged. Today, the area the size of 10 soccer fields in Sao Paulo\u2019s old city center, is spotless and silent.",
      "Lieutenant Sao Paulo Gov. Felicio Ramuth, who was picked by Gov. de Freitas to clean up Crackland, said last week that there was no police brutality linked to the scattering of residents.",
      "\u201cWe had 50 police raids at the scene (and) 1,000 criminals were jailed,\u201d he told daily O Estado de S.Paulo on Wednesday. \u201cWe did not receive any accusation of police brutality.\u201d",
      "Ramuth said that 1,200 drug users who were in the area until a few weeks ago are now under treatment in clinics, but offered no evidence to support his claim. He added that he will deem Crackland free of drug users if its current condition remains for the next six months.",
      "Gov. De Freitas, a former minister under President Jair Bolsonaro, is reportedly considering running against President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in the 2026 presidential election. His rivals claim he stands to gain political capital by ending Crackland, which could also make way for a 5-billion Brazilian reais ($900 million) project to relocate about 60 state government buildings to the area.",
      "Critics of the government's strategy to end Crackland are crying foul. Catholic priest J\u00falio Lancelotti, who has worked with homeless people for most of his 76 years, said police brutality and the scattering of drug users will not solve the problem.",
      "\u201cIt is not right to make political propaganda to say Crackland disappeared,\" Lancelotti said. \"Crackland is not a physical area, it's about people. They are being taken to isolated regions, they are not going to clinics.\u201d",
      "The city hall of Guarulhos, a city within the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, expressed concern in a recent statement about the accusations by Lancelotti and other activists who claim that the residents of Crackland \u201chad been brought and abandoned\u201d there. It added it will investigate the case.",
      "Sao Paulo Mayor Nunes denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Giordano Magri, a University of Sao Paulo researcher specializing in urban issues, said the current crackdown on Crackland aims to remove the infrastructure for drug users to survive in the area, but they will eventually find similar conditions elsewhere.",
      "\u201cSince the governor and the mayor became more authoritarian, that ecosystem is gone. But they can't do this forever,\u201d said Magri, who added that people leaving Crackland will have more than 70 smaller spots across the city to relocate to.",
      "Rog\u00e9rio, the man whose guitar was broken, fears the situation could get worse in the coming days as hundreds seek to return.",
      "\u201cWe are real people. I say that with a sour heart. I am garbage, I know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now that they are scattering the garbage, the problem will grow.\u201d",

      "Hong Kong\u2019s first locally born giant pandas have finally been named and introduced as Jia Jia and De De on Tuesday",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's first locally born giant pandas have finally been named and introduced as Jia Jia and De De.",
      "The names of the cubs, affectionately known as \u201cElder Sister\u201d and \u201cLittle Brother,\u201d were announced Tuesday in a ceremony at Ocean Park, the theme park housing them, their parents and two other giant pandas that arrived from mainland China last year.",
      "The names were the winning suggestions from residents in a naming contest that drew more than 35,700 entries.",
      "The Chinese character \u201cJia,\u201d from the female cub's name \u201cJia Jia,\u201d carries a message of support and features an element of family and a sense of auspicious grace. The name embodies the prosperity of families and the nation and the happiness of the people, the park said.",
      "The Chinese character \u201cDe,\" from the male cub's name, means to succeed, carrying the connotation that Hong Kong is successful in everything. De also has the same pronunciation as the Chinese character for virtue, the park said, suggesting giant pandas possess virtues cherished by Chinese people.",
      "Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said they followed tradition by using Mandarin pronunciation for the pandas\u2019 English names. He said \u201cJia\" sounds like a word in the Cantonese term for elder sister, while \u201cDe De\u201d sounds a bit like the Cantonese phrase for little brother. Cantonese is the mother language of many Hong Kongers.",
      "\u201cIt's a very positive pair of names,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be a bit creative here with the names.\u201d",
      "The cubs, who live with their mom, attracted crowds of visitors on Tuesday. Jia Jia explored a rock and walked around their area, while De De climbed a tree.",
      "Visitor Polly Luk, a panda lover with an annual pass to the park, spent an hour in line to see the cubs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so used to their old names. Even now they have new names, I'll still call them \u2018Elder Sister\u2019 and \u2018Little Brother\u2019,\" Luk said.",
      "The twins' birth in August made their mother, Ying Ying, the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mom. Their popularity among residents, visitors and on social media raised hopes for a tourism boost in the city, where politicians touted the commercial opportunities as the \u201cpanda economy.\u201d",
      "Observers are watching whether housing six pandas helps the park revive its business, especially when caring for the animals in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year.",
      "The park recorded a nearly 40% growth in visitor flow and 40% increase in overall income during a five-day holiday beginning May 1 in mainland China, said Pong, who hopes the growth momentum will continue through summer, Halloween and Christmas seasons.",
      "Pandas are considered China\u2019s unofficial national mascot. The country\u2019s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing\u2019s soft-power diplomacy.",

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) \u2014 King Charles III will outline new Prime Minister Mark Carney's government priorities in a speech in the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday. It's widely viewed as a show of support in the face of annexation threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex Canada  prompted Prime Minister Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",

      "The speech is not written by the king or his U.K. advisers as Charles serves as a nonpartisan head of state. He will read what is put before him by Canada\u2019s government.",
      "Carney , the new prime minister and a former head of the Bank of England, and Canada\u2019s first Indigenous governor general, Mary Simon, the king\u2019s representative in Canada, met with the king on Monday.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the United States. The king\u2019s visit clearly underscores Canada\u2019s sovereignty, he said.",

    "story": [
      "More than 200 Ukrainian POWs have died in Russian prisons since Moscow's full-scale invasion three years ago",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cEverything will be all right.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian soldier Serhii Hryhoriev said this so often during brief phone calls from the front that his wife and two daughters took it to heart. His younger daughter, Oksana, tattooed the phrase on her wrist as a talisman.",
      "Even after Hryhoriev was captured by the Russian army in 2022, his anxious family clung to the belief that he would ultimately be OK. After all, Russia is bound by international law to protect prisoners of war.",
      "When Hryhoriev finally came home, though, it was in a body bag.",
      "A Russian death certificate said the 59-year-old died of a stroke. But a Ukrainian autopsy and a former POW who was detained with him tell a different story about how he died \u2013 one of violence and medical neglect at the hands of his captors.",
      "Hryhoriev is one of more than 200 Ukrainian POWs who have died while imprisoned since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion three years ago. Abuse inside Russian prisons was likely a contributing factor in many of these deaths, according to officials from human rights groups, the U.N., the Ukrainian government and a Ukrainian medical examiner who has performed dozens of POW autopsies.",
      "The officials say the prison death toll adds to evidence that Russia is systematically brutalizing captured soldiers. They say forensic discrepancies like Hryhoriev's, and the repatriation of bodies that are mutilated and decomposed, point to an effort to cover up alleged torture, starvation and poor health care at dozens of prisons and detention centers across Russia and occupied Ukraine.",
      "Russian authorities did not respond to requests for comment. They have previously accused Ukraine of mistreating Russian POWs \u2014 allegations the U.N. has partially backed up, though it says Ukraine's violations are far less common and severe than what Russia is accused of.",
      "Hryhoriev joined the Ukrainian army in 2019 after he lost his job as an office worker at a high school. When the war began three years later, he was stationed with other soldiers in Mariupol, an industrial port city that was the site of a fierce battle \u2014 and far from his home in the central Poltava region.",
      "On April 10, 2022, Hryhoriev called his family to reassure them that \u201ceverything will be all right.\u201d That was the last time they ever spoke to him.",
      "Two days later, a relative of a soldier in Hryhoriev\u2019s unit called to say the men had been captured. After Mariupol fell to Russia, more than 2,000 soldiers defending the city became Russian prisoners.",
      "Soon his family got a call from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which confirmed he was alive and officially registered as a POW, guaranteeing his protection under the Geneva Conventions. \u201cWe were told: \u2018that means everything is fine \u2026 Russia has to return him,\u2019\u201d Hryhoriev\u2019s wife, Halyna, recalled.",
      "In August 2022, she received a letter from him, that addressed her by a nickname. \u201cMy dear Halochka,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am alive and well. Everything will be all right.\u201d",
      "Desperate for more information, his daughter Oksana, 31, scoured Russian social media accounts, where videos of Ukrainian POWs regularly appeared. Eventually, she saw him in one \u2014 looking gaunt and missing teeth. His gray hair was cropped very short, framing gentle features now partially covered by a beard.",
      "In the video, likely shot under duress, Hryhoriev said to the camera: \u201cI\u2019m alive and well.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut if you looked at him, you could see that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Oksana said.",
      "The truth was dismal, said Oleksii Honcharov, a 48-year-old Ukrainian POW who was detained with him.",
      "Honcharov lived in the same prison barracks as Hryhoriev starting in the fall of 2022. Over a period of months, he witnessed Hryhoriev absorb the same severe punishment as every other POW at the Kamensk-Shakhtinsky Correctional Colony in southwest Russia.",
      "\u201cEveryone got hit -- no exceptions,\u201d said Honcharov, who was repatriated to Ukraine in February as part of a prisoner swap. \u201cSome more, some less, but we all took it.\u201d",
      "Honcharov endured months of chest pain while in captivity. Even then, the beatings never stopped, he said, and sometimes they began after his pleas for medical care, which were ignored.",
      "\u201cToward the end, I could barely walk,\u201d said Honcharov, who was diagnosed with tuberculosis once back in Ukraine \u2013 an increasingly common ailment among returning POWs.",
      "A 2024 U.N. report found that 95% of released Ukrainian POWs had endured \u201csystematic\u201d torture. Prisoners described beatings, electric shocks, suffocation, sexual violence, prolonged stress positions, mock executions, and sleep deprivation.",
      "\u201cThis conduct could not be more unlawful,\u201d said Danielle Bell, the U.N.\u2019s top human rights monitor in Ukraine.",
      "The report also said some Russian POWs were mistreated by Ukrainian forces during their initial capture -- including beatings, threats and electric shocks. But the abuse stopped once Russian POWs were moved to official Ukrainian detention centers, the report said.",
      "Hryhoriev was physically strong and often outlasted younger prisoners during forced exercises, Honcharov recalled. But over time, he began showing signs of physical decline: dizziness, fatigue and, eventually, an inability to walk without help.",
      "Yet despite his worsening condition, prison officials provided only minimal health care, Honcharov said.",
      "In a bright, sterile room with the sour-sweet smell of human decomposition, Inna Padei performs autopsies on Ukrainian soldiers repatriated by Russia, as well as civilians exhumed from mass graves. Hundreds of bodies zipped up in black plastic bags have been delivered in refrigerated trucks to the morgue where she works in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.",
      "Those who died in battle are still wearing military fatigues and often have obvious external wounds. The bodies of former POWs are dressed in prison uniforms and are often mutilated and decomposed.",
      "It is the job of Padei and other forensic experts to piece together how soldiers like Hryhoriev died. These reports are often the only reliable information the soldiers\u2019 families get \u2014 and they will be used by Ukraine, along with testimony from former POWs, to bring war crimes charges against Russia at the International Criminal Court.",
      "The body of a former POW recently examined by Padei had an almond-sized fracture on the right side of its skull. That suggested the soldier was struck by a blunt object \u2013 a blow potentially strong enough to have killed him instantly, or shortly after, she said.",
      "\u201cThese injuries may not always be the direct cause of death,\u201d Padei said, \u201cbut they clearly indicate the use of force and torture against the servicemen.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Amnesty International documented widespread torture of Ukrainian POWs in Russia. Its report was especially critical of Russia's secrecy regarding the whereabouts and condition of POWs, saying it refused to grant rights groups or health workers access to its prisons, leaving families in the dark for months or years about their loved ones.",
      "Of the more than 5,000 POWs Russia has repatriated to Ukraine, at least 206 died in captivity, including more than 50 when an explosion ripped through a Russian-controlled prison barracks, according to the Ukrainian government. An additional 245 Ukrainian POWs were killed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield, according to Ukrainian prosecutors.",
      "The toll of dead POWs is expected to rise as more bodies are returned and identified, but forensic experts face significant challenges in determining causes of death.",
      "In some cases, internal organs are missing. Other times, it appears as if bruises or injuries have been hidden or removed.",
      "Ukrainian officials believe the mutilation of bodies is an effort by Russia to conceal the true causes of death. Extreme decomposition is another obstacle, officials say.",
      "\u201cThey hold the bodies until they reach a state where nothing can be determined,\u201d said Petro Yatsenko, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian government agency in charge of POW affairs.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the prompt exchange of POWs must be part of any ceasefire agreement, along with the return of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, including children forcibly deported to Russia. A major prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine took place over the weekend.",
      "The Associated Press interviewed relatives of 21 Ukrainian POWs who died in captivity. Autopsies performed in Ukraine found that five of these POWs died of heart failure, including soldiers who were 22, 39 and 43. Four others died from tuberculosis or pneumonia, and three others perished, respectively, from an infection, asphyxia and a blunt force head wound.",
      "Padei said cases like these \u2014 and others she has seen \u2014 are red flags, suggesting that physical abuse and untreated injuries and illness likely contributed to many soldiers' deaths.",
      "\u201cUnder normal or humane conditions, these would not have been fatal,\u201d Padei said.",
      "In one autopsy report, coroners said an individual had been electrocuted and beaten just days before dying of heart failure and extreme emaciation. Other autopsies noted that bodies showed signs of gangrene or untreated infections.",
      "\u201cEverything the returned prisoners describe \u2026 we see the same on the bodies,\u201d Padei said.",
      "Months into Hryhoriev\u2019s detention at the Kamensk-Shakhtinsky prison \u2013 and after his daughter saw him in the Russian army\u2019s social media video -- his health deteriorated significantly, according to Honcharov.",
      "But instead of being sent to a hospital, Hryhoriev was moved to a tiny cell that was isolated from other prisoners. Another Ukrainian captive, a paramedic, was assigned to stay with him.",
      "\u201cIt was damp, cold, with no lighting at all,\u201d recalled Honcharov.",
      "He died in that cell about a month later, Honcharov said. It was May 20, 2023, according to his Russian death certificate.",
      "The Hryhoriev family didn't learn he had died until more than six months later, when a former POW reached out. Then, in March 2024, police in central Ukraine called: A body had arrived with a Russian death certificate bearing Hryhoriev\u2019s name. A DNA test confirmed it was him.",
      "An autopsy performed in Ukraine disputed Russia\u2019s claim that Hryhoriev died of a stroke. It said he bled to death after blunt trauma to his abdomen that also damaged his spleen.",
      "Hryhoriev\u2019s body was handed over to the family last June, and soon after he was buried in his hometown of Pyriatyn.",
      "To honor him, Hryhoriev\u2019s wife and older daughter, Yana, followed Oksana's lead and tattooed their wrists with the optimistic expression he had drilled into them.",
      "\u201cNow we have an angel in the sky watching over us,\u201d Halyna said. \u201cWe believe everything will be all right.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Stragglers beware: U.S. travelers flying with United Airlines will have to check in to domestic flights a little earlier starting next week",
      "NEW YORK -- Stragglers beware: U.S. travelers flying with United Airlines will have to check in to domestic flights a little earlier starting next week. That is, if they're customers only taking carry-on bags.",
      "Effective June 3, United's \u201ccheck-in cutoff\u201d for most U.S. flights will be 45 minutes before departure. That's the same deadline United has for passengers checking luggage at the airport but 15 minutes earlier than the current one for people without bags to check.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, a United spokesperson said the change to a single cut-off minimum \u201cbrings greater consistency for our customers\u201d and conforms with the policies of many other airlines.",
      "Checking in for a flight confirms a passenger's booking and intent to travel ahead of takeoff. Most major U.S. carriers have online check-in systems that can be used at least 24 hours in advance, so the process no longer reflects when many travelers arrive at the airport. But it's still an important step since boarding passes are issued once check-ins are completed.",
      "Other U.S. and international carriers have tightened their check-in and boarding policies as part of their strategies for maintaining on-time departures, particularly amid the high demand that followed the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Generally speaking, checking in allows airports and airlines to prepare for upcoming flights \u2014 from confirming seat assignments to making sure passenger names are at the security checkpoint. Check-in cutoffs, or the latest possible time to claim a flight reservation, are typically earlier for international flights to account for the time needed to check passports and clear customs.",
      "Still, requirements may vary by airline and airport. Dubai-based Emirates, for example, closes online check-ins 90 minutes before departure. Ireland\u2019s Ryanair allows online check-in up to two hours before a flight; passengers still may check in at the airport 40 minutes in advance, but for a fee.",
      "Here's what check-in cutoffs look like for United and some other U.S. carriers.",
      "Again, if you\u2019re flying United within the U.S., you'll need to check in to your flight at least 45 minutes prior to takeoff as of June 3.",
      "While the new cutoff applies to most of United's domestic trips, check-in deadlines may vary by location and route. The carrier's website notes that St. Thomas' airport in the U.S. Virgin Islands has a check-in time limit of 90 minutes prior to departure \u2014 the same cutoff listed for flights between Guam and Honolulu.",
      "For international flights, United requires checking in at least an hour before departure. But many airports have earlier deadlines \u2014 such as 75 minutes for major airports in Paris and Dubai, and 90 minutes for the airports in Toronto and Lagos, Nigeria.",
      "Delta passengers not checking any bags still have a minimum of a half-hour before a domestic flight to check in. Travelers with luggage to check need to get to the airline ticket counter at least 45 minutes prior, Delta's website notes, per an update that went into effect last month.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP on Tuesday, Delta said it had made this \u201cminor change\" so that \u201cDelta teams can ensure all customers have a great experience.\u201d",
      "For international flights, Delta travelers must be checked in at least 1 hour before departure. But, like other carriers, Delta's minimum check-in requirements can vary by location for certain airports. Delta customers checking bags at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, for example, are supposed to check in an hour before departure whether their flights are domestic or international.",
      "If you're flying with American Airlines within the U.S., the deadline for checking in and checking a bag before a flight is 45 minutes ahead of departure, according to the carrier's website.",
      "For trips to or from locations outside the U.S., the cutoff to both check-in for your flight and check a bag is 60 minutes ahead of takeoff. But again, a handful of airports have earlier requirements.",
      "Passengers with more than a carry-on bag should get to the airline counter at least 45 minutes before a scheduled flight on Southwest. The carrier warns that baggage destined for a plane's cargo hold is considered a \u201clate check\u201d and not guaranteed to get on your flight if it's dropped off less than 45 minutes ahead of departure.",
      "Beyond baggage, if Southwest travelers aren\u2019t checked-in and in the boarding area at least 10 minutes prior to departure, their reservation could be canceled, a Southwest spokesperson told the AP via email.",
      "The carrier did not specify any additional, firm check-in cutoffs for domestic flights. For international trips, Southwest's website notes that all passengers and their luggage must be checked in a minimum of 60 minutes prior to departure. And again, that can vary \u2014 with flights departing Aruba, for example, having an earlier deadline of 75 minutes before takeoff for passengers with or without checked bags.",
      "Alaska requires a minimum of 50 minutes before takeoff to check in passengers for flights within the U.S., whether or not they have bags to check. The cutoff is 60 minutes for international flights, the carrier\u2019s website notes.",
      "Again, there are exceptions for certain locations and airports. Passengers traveling from Guadalajara, Mexico, for example, have to check their baggage and into their flights at least 90 minutes ahead of time.",

      "It's the last day to book a flight on Southwest Airlines without being hit with a fee to check bags after the airline abandoned a decades-long luggage policy that executives had described last fall as key to differentiating the budget carrier from its rivals.",
      "The airline announced the change in March, saying at the time that the the new policy would start with flights booked on Wednesday.",
      "Southwest had built years of advertising campaigns around its policy of letting passengers check up to two bags for free. Under its new policy, people who haven\u2019t either reached the upper tiers of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, bought a business class ticket or hold the airline\u2019s credit card will have to pay for checked bags.",
      "Southwest will continue to offer two free checked bags to Rapid Rewards A-List preferred members and customers traveling on Business Select fares, and one free checked bag to A-List members and other select customers. Passengers with Rapid Rewards credit cards will receive a credit for one checked bag.",
      "People who don\u2019t qualify for those categories will get charged to check bags. The airline said in March that it also would roll out a new, basic fare on its lowest priced tickets when the change takes effect.",
      "The airline estimated in September that charging bag fees would bring in about $1.5 billion a year but cost the airline $1.8 billion in lost business from customers who chose to fly Southwest because of its generous baggage allowance.",
      "Southwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its new checked bag fees, but most major airlines typically charge between $35 and $40 for checked bags.",
      "Another policy that will take effect on Wednesday is Southwest requiring passengers to keep their portable chargers in plain sight while using them because of concerns about the growing number of lithium-ion battery fires.",
      "These aren't the only changes at Southwest. The Dallas airline previously announced that it was leaving behind another Southwest tradition, the open-boarding system it has used for more than 50 years. Southwest expects to begin operating flights with passengers in assigned seats next year.",
      "The airline also said last year that it would charge customers extra for more legroom and offer red-eye flights.",
      "Southwest has struggled recently and is under pressure from activist investors to boost profits and revenue. The airline reached a truce in October with hedge fund Elliott Investment Management to avoid a proxy fight, but Elliott won several seats on the company's board.",
      "The airline announced in February that it was eliminating 1,750 jobs, or 15% of its corporate workforce, in the first major layoffs in the company\u2019s 53-year history.",

      "BRUSSELS -- A large majority of European Union countries on Tuesday called on Hungary to revise a new law that allows bans on public events by LGBTQ+ communities, as pressure mounts on the country\u2019s populist government over democratic backsliding.",
      "In a declaration, at least 20 out of the EU's 27 nations, including France, Germany and Spain, expressed concern that the law passed in April allows for fines on people organizing or taking part in Pride events, and the use of facial recognition software to identify them.",
      "\u201cWe are highly alarmed by these developments, which run contrary to the fundamental values of human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights\u201d enshrined in the EU treaties, they said.",

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) \u2014 King Charles III said Canada is facing unprecedented challenges in a world that's never been more dangerous as he opened the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday with a speech widely viewed as a show of support in the face of annexation threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex Canada prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne outlining his government's priorities for the new session of Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cWe must face reality: since the Second World War, our world has never been more dangerous and unstable. Canada is facing challenges that, in our lifetimes, are unprecedented,\" Charles said in French.",
      "He added that \u201cmany Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them.\"",
      "It's rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice before in 1957 and 1977.",
      "Charles, on his 20th visit to Canada, noted that it has been nearly 70 years since his mother first opened Parliament.",
      "\"Canada has dramatically changed: repatriating its constitution, achieving full independence, and witnessing immense growth. Canada has embraced its British, French, and Indigenous roots, and become a bold, ambitious, innovative country that is bilingual, truly multicultural,\u201d the monarch said.",
      "He said when his late mother opened a new session of Canadian Parliament in 1957, World War II remained a fresh, painful memory and said the Cold War was intensifying.",
      "\"Freedom and democracy were under threat,\" he said. \u201cToday, Canada faces another critical moment.\"",
      "The speech isn't written by the king or his U.K. advisers as Charles serves as a nonpartisan head of state. He read what was put before him by Canada\u2019s government, but makes some remarks of his own.",
      "\u201dI have always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values, and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians,\u201d he said.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the United States. The king\u2019s visit clearly underscores Canada\u2019s sovereignty, he said.",
      "Carney won the job of prime minister by promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump and made his first trip as prime minister to London and Paris, the capital cities of Canada's two founding nations.",
      "Carney is eager to diversify trade, and the king said that Canada can build new alliances. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.",
      "The new U.S. ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, said that sending messages to the U.S. isn\u2019t necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that if there\u2019s a message to be sent, there are easier ways to do that, such as calling him or calling the president.",
      "The king said that among the priorities for the government is protection of the French language and Quebec culture, which are at the heart of Canadian identity.",
      "\u201cThey define the country that Canadians, and I, love so much. Canada is a country where official and Indigenous languages \u200b\u200bare respected and celebrated,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said the Canada must protect Quebec's dairy supply management industry. Trump attacked the industry in trade talks.",
      "And he said that the Canadian government will protect Canada\u2019s sovereignty by reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces. Trump has complained that Canadas doesn't spend enough on its military.",
      "The king said that Canada would look to the European Union to purchase military equipment by joining the \"REARM Europe\u201d plan \u2014 a major defence procurement project to ramp up arms production in Europe. The speech made no mention of buying from the U.S.",
      "A horse-drawn carriage tookCharles and Queen Camilla to the Senate of Canada Building for the speech. It was accompanied by 28 horses, 14 before and 14 after. After inspecting a 100-person honor guard and receiving a 21-gun salute, King Charles entered the Senate building as the crowd cheered.",
      "Former Canadian Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau and Stephen Harper were among those in attendance.",
      "The king returned U.K. after the speech and a visit to Canada\u2019s National War Memorial.",
      "Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian, said the king\u2019s visit reminds him of when Queen Elizabeth II opened the Parliament in Grenada, a member of the commonwealth, in 1985.",

      "A Texas oil executive from Elon Musk\u2019s government efficiency team has been tasked with overhauling the federal agency that manages vast tracts of public lands",
      "A Texas oil executive from Elon Musk\u2019s government efficiency team has been given sweeping powers to overhaul the federal department that manages vast tracts of resource-rich public lands, but he hasn't divested his energy investments or filed an ethics commitment to break ties with companies that pose a conflict of interest, records show.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently directed Tyler Hassen, who lacks Senate confirmation and has no public administration experience, to reorganize the Interior Department, which oversees some 70,000 employees in 11 agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.",
      "Before joining DOGE, Hassen spent nearly two decades as an executive at Basin Holdings, an enterprise involved in the manufacture, sale and servicing of oil rigs worldwide. A financial disclosure report obtained by AP shows Hassen made millions annually from these companies, owned by John Fitzgibbons \u2014 an industry giant who is well-connected in Russia.",
      "These and other potential conflicts of interest are compounding the concerns of Democratic lawmakers, conservation groups and environmental advocates, who say Hassen\u2019s appointment appears designed to evade Senate confirmation and oversight while testing the limits of congressional authority.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a dereliction of duty to offload decisions about staffing and funding at the Interior Department to someone who hasn\u2019t even been confirmed by the Senate,\u201d said Kate Groetzinger, with the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation group.",
      "Interior officials didn\u2019t respond to requests to interview Hassen.",
      "Department spokesperson Katie Martin said in an email that Hassen is helping achieve the president\u2019s vision for major changes, and Interior will \u201ccontinue to prioritize retaining first responders, parks services and energy production employees.\u201d",
      "Once inside Interior in January, Hassen reviewed \u201cevery single contract, every single grant,\u201d and sent action items to Burgum, he told FOX News in an April interview. Burgum praised Hassen and DOGE on X, saying they \u201chave identified massive amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse already!\u201d",
      "A draft copy of Interior's new strategic plan includes increasing \u201cclean coal, oil, and gas production through faster permitting\u201d while reducing regulations to \u201cgenerate more revenue from lands and resources for the U.S. Treasury.\u201d",
      "Hassen also has twice filed a notice in the Federal Register extending Trump\u2019s freeze on regulations \u2014 which stops agencies from proposing or issuing new rules \u2014 and removed the opportunity for public comment as \u201ccontrary to the public interest.\u201d The latest extension pushes it to June 4.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how Hassen became involved with Musk. There\u2019s little information about him online. He told FOX News that before DOGE, he was \u201crunning five businesses in Houston.\" He said this work \u201cis me giving back to the country.\u201d",
      "Hassen was an executive at Fitzgibbons-owned Basin Holdings \u2014 the privately held parent company for Basin Energy and Basin Industries \u2014 since 2008. An old Facebook page for Tyler Hassen includes a 2010 photo of him at the \u201cSamotlor Field, Western Siberia - largest oilfield in Russia.\u201d",
      "Hassen\u2019s brother, Todd, is also a Texas energy executive. He's been CEO of Red Wolfpack Resources since 2024 and was with Tellurian, a natural gas company, and EagleStone Resources before that, according to his LinkedIn page.",
      "Burgum named Hassen his assistant secretary for policy, management and budget in March, but changed his title in April to \u201cprincipal deputy assistant secretary.\u201d An assistant secretary requires Senate approval and an ethics commitment to resign positions that would create a conflict of interest. A principal deputy does not.",
      "Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, said Interior officials are committing fraud \u201cby calling someone by a different name so that they don\u2019t have to file a really important document where they explain how they\u2019re going to comply with ethics standards.\u201d",
      "Hassen sought to fire a top department lawyer in April for refusing to give him and other DOGE officials access to a highly sensitive personnel database as he pushed for massive department-wide staff reductions through buyouts, early retirements and layoffs. Hassen wrote that Tony Irish, an associate solicitor, was \u201csubverting, obstructing and delaying the process\" and should be removed for misconduct.",
      "Irish is on leave while appealing the firing and is represented by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. \u201cIn seeking to remove Tony Irish, Tyler Hassen has demonstrated his own unfitness for federal service,\u201d PEER executive director Tim Whitehouse said in a press release. \u201cThis type of corporate bullying is not how the people\u2019s business is supposed to be conducted.\u201d",
      "Jacob Malcom, a former Interior Department executive, said Burgum's order directing Hassen to make \u201cappropriate funding decisions\u201d for administrative changes and ensure \u201cthe appropriate transfer of funds, programs, records and property\" is unconstitutional \u2014 Congress appropriates funds, not assistant secretaries.",
      "\u201cUnless Congress has explicitly authorized those funds to be moved, they can\u2019t actually transfer the funds,\u201d Malcom said. \u201cThat\u2019s just flat out illegal.\u201d",
      "Although Hassen didn't file a divestment commitment, he did file a financial disclosure in February \u2014 revised five times, the most recent dated April 21 \u2014 revealing he made almost $4 million annually from Fitzgibbon's oilfield services companies. Hassen said he sold his equity in these companies and is being paid in installments through June 2026.",
      "Hassen reported that he holds $50,001 to $100,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon\u2019s company Block Harvest, a cryptocurrency mining business that uses flared natural gas to run data centers. He reported owning $250,000 to $500,000 worth of stock in Fitzgibbon\u2019s Global Guardian, a security company.",
      "Hassen also declared 254 stock holdings, including cryptocurrency, tobacco, foreign banking and between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock each in Archrock, a Houston company that specializes in natural gas compression services; WEC Energy Group, which holds electric and natural gas companies and Quanta Services, which is involved in pipelines and pumping.",
      "He's got a similar stake in Albemarle Corp., which owns the Silver Peak lithium mine in Nevada \u2014 the nation's only active lithium source. It's currently seeking authorization from Interior's Bureau of Land Management to expand its operations.",
      "Hassen\u2019s potential conflicts of interest have raised concerns among environmental groups and some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "He\u2019s attempting to remove regulations constraining the fossil fuel industries, said Josh Axelrod, a senior policy advocate with the National Resources Defense Council. \u201cAs a member of those industries, he\u2019s uniquely qualified to flag the ones they don\u2019t like.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, the ranking Democrats on Interior's Senate and House oversight subcommittees, have demanded a stop to Hassen's large-scale reorganization.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told Burgum in a May 7 letter that \u201cdelegating sweeping authorities and responsibilities to a non-Senate confirmed person in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act is baffling and extremely troubling.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor ASEAN, our peace, stability and prosperity have often depended on an open, inclusive, rules-based international order... These foundations are now being dismantled under the force of arbitrary action,\" Anwar said.",
      "ASEAN, which has agreed to avoid retaliatory measures, has formed a taskforce to coordinate a response to the U.S. tariffs in parallel with bilateral negotiations by some member countries, Anwar said. ASEAN members include bigger economies such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.",

Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs in April for most of the world, and this month struck a similar deal with key rival China, easing trade war tensions.",

The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "ASEAN leaders later Monday will launch a new 20-year vision to deepen their economic and social integration, Anwar said.",
      "Analysts said China, which is ASEAN's top trading partner, wants to expand its influence by presenting itself as a reliable ally in the region. But tensions persist over Beijing's aggressive stance in the disputed South China Sea that has led to frequent clashes especially with the Philippines.",

      "On the Myanmar crisis, Anwar said Malaysia has managed to \u201cmove the needle forward\u201d after forming an informal advisory group headed by former Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra. Anwar met last month with Myanmar military chief Gen. Ming Aung Hlaing in Bangkok and held virtual talks with the opposition National Unity Government.",
      "Officials said the current emphasis on aid delivery following a March earthquake that killed 3,700 people could eventually pave the way for peace talks. But critics accuse the army of violating a self-proclaimed ceasefire with dozens of airstrikes, with aid not freely allowed into areas not under the army\u2019s control.",
      "The Myanmar war, which has killed thousands and displaced millions, is a challenge to ASEAN since refugees have fled across borders to neighboring nations. The region has also seen rising transnational crimes and cybercrimes. The bloc has made little headway after the Myanmar military refused to comply with its peace plan, including a ceasefire, delivery of humanitarian aid and negotiations.",
      "Anwar said more engagement is being planned in Myanmar.",
      "\u201cQuiet engagement matters. The steps may be small and the bridge may be fragile but as they say: In matters of peace, even a fragile bridge is better than a widening gulf,\u201d Anwar said.",
      "Thomas Daniel from Malaysia's Institute of Strategic and International Studies said ASEAN has no real leverage to push for reconciliation. The Myanmar military has reportedly lost control of a large part of the country, making the situation even more challenging.",
      "\u201cThe conditions on the ground are extremely difficult. I don\u2019t think we have reached a stage where ASEAN can facilitate any kind of political dialogue between conflicting parties. They are not ready for that yet,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans were jubilant after muscling through President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax and immigration package by a single vote. But across the Capitol, senators were more cautious.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune can afford to lose three Republican senators and still pass the bill, and there are more than that, right now, who have problems with it. Like the House, he will have to balance the concerns from moderate and conservative members of his conference.",
      "Republicans\u2019 aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to discuss the legislation and that they would want to take some time to review it. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll put our stamp on it,\u201d he said.",

      "Several Republican senators have said the House\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar tax package doesn't have enough savings. Thune said many in his GOP conference favor the tax breaks in the bill but \u201cwhen it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time, in history, where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about how to control government spending.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a sharp critic of the House bill, wants the United States to go back to pre-pandemic spending levels. He has indicated he would be a no on the bill as it stands now, and he says he has at least three other senators aligned with him.",

But Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Susan Collins of Maine, among others, have voiced concerns about other changes in the bill that could potentially cut funding to rural hospitals or increase copays and other health care costs for recipients.",
      "The senators could have a powerful ally in Trump, who has frequently said he doesn\u2019t want cuts to Medicaid, even as he\u2019s endorsed the House bill. Hawley said he talked to Trump this week on the phone and \u201chis exact words were, \u2018Don\u2019t touch it, Josh.\u2019\u201d",
      "Others have been wary of the House bill\u2019s effort to shift some costs of the food stamp program to states, potentially a major issue for some red states that have high numbers of food aid recipients. The House bill saves $290 billion from the food aid, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman said the Senate savings will be \u201cprobably be a little bit lower.\u201d",
      "Thune said this week that \u201cone of the principal differences\u201d between the House and Senate is that Republican senators want to make many of the tax cuts permanent while the House bill has shorter time frames for many of its cuts \u2014 including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car-loan interest and others.",
      "Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo said Thursday that trying to make some of the cuts permanent is \u201can objective right now.\"",
      "One of the biggest questions for the Senate: whether the tax breaks really need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
      "To offset the costs of lost tax revenue, House Republicans have proposed more than $1 trillion in spending reductions across Medicaid, food stamps and green energy program rollbacks. However, Republicans in the Senate do not believe there is a cost associated with permanently extending the existing taxes, setting up a political and procedural showdown ahead.",
      "The House bill includes a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the United States is on track to run out of money to pay its bills as early as August without congressional action.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he won\u2019t support the bill if the debt ceiling increase is included. He said he\u2019s willing to consider it if it\u2019s taken out.",
      "But most Republican senators want it to avoid a separate fight that would require 60 votes in the Senate. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that if they deal with the debt ceiling outside of the legislation then they would have to \u201cpay a king\u2019s ransom\u201d to Democrats to get enough votes.",
      "Several Republican senators have said they are concerned about House provisions that repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 that have spurred investment in many states.",
      "Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Moran wrote Thune a letter last month arguing that removing the credits could \"create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.\u201d",
      "The House bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, giving the federal government more control over the policy. It\u2019s an approach that has been favored by the AI industry but has drawn concern from members on both sides of the aisle.",
      "And even if it has enough support, the provision may not pass muster from the Senate parliamentarian because it\u2019s unlikely to have impact on the federal budget.",
      "With a narrow margin for victory and only 53 Republicans in the Senate, every senator\u2019s top priority takes on outsize importance. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said he supports the House bill but that the way that it deals with spectrum auctions \u2014 selling off telecommunications signal rights \u2014 is a \u201cdealbreaker\u201d for him. He said he\u2019s in talks with other senators on the issue.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said one of his main goals is that they include money for certain farm safety net programs and set up passage for a broader farm bill later this year.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have to have 50 plus one supporting it,\u201d Hoeven said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got some work to do.\"",

      "Sales at building materials and garden supply retailers rose 0.8% last month from March, the biggest gain since 2022, and were up 3.2% from April last year. At the same time, U.S. retail sales overall rose 0.1%, a sharp slowdown from March.",

      "Spending on home renovations has remained resilient as elevated mortgage rates and skyrocketing home prices have frozen out many would-be buyers. That's kept U.S. home sales in a slump, limiting the market for homeowners who want to sell.",
      "Many homeowners also bought or refinanced their mortgage when the average rate on a 30-year home loan was below 3% or 4% in the first couple of years of the pandemic. That's made them reluctant to sell now, when the average rate is hovering near 7%.",

Nearly half of the owner-occupied homes in the U.S. were built before 1980 and have a median age of 41 years, according to an analysis of Census data by the National Association of Home Builders. That aging stock of homes has helped fuel the need for repairs and improvements.",

      "It also forecasts annual increases from here that will drive spending to $526 billion by the first quarter of next year. That would represent a 2.5% increase from the first quarter of this year.",
      "Rising home prices and signs of a solid economy have supported the outlook for higher spending on home improvement, but that could change if the housing market and economic outlook worsen, said Carlos Mart\u00edn, director of the JCHS\u2019 Remodeling Futures Program.",
      "\u201cBuilding materials retail sales are strong, but we are seeing a significant downturn in the sales of existing homes and their median sales price since the last projection \u2014 both are known contributors to home improvements,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBroader economic turbulence like a recession, a worsening job market or higher inflation would almost certainly temper our expectations.\u201d",

MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander threw a pass between Jaden McDaniels' legs while doing the splits and falling to the ground, and Williams caught it and drained a 3-pointer that gave the Thunder a 116-109 lead.",
      "\u201cHonestly I think the clock was low so I was just kind of like, \u2018Shoot it.\u2019 ... Just shots in general, I work really hard and shoot a lot of them, so when I\u2019m shooting them, that\u2019s kind of my mindset going into it: Just being aggressive and take what the defense gives me,\" Williams said.",
      "The timing of the shot was critical, and it gave the Thunder some much-needed cushion against a Timberwolves team that did not quit.",
      "\u201cThis journey is not easy, and it\u2019s not meant to be easy,\" Williams said. \"These experiences will make us better. Down the stretch, you\u2019ve got to know the score, obviously, but you can\u2019t let that affect the game. They\u2019re going to score. They\u2019re a really good team. ... I think a lot of it is we just stayed with it.\u201d",
      "While Gilgeous-Alexander has garnered most of the attention for the Thunder this season, Williams quietly has stacked up accolades and played a key role in their league-best 68-14 regular-season record. Williams was named an All-Star for the first time, then was selected third-team All-NBA and second-team all-defense.",
      "It hasn't been all smooth for Williams in the playoffs \u2014 he hit some ruts against Denver in the Western Conference semifinals and he scored only 13 points in the Game 3 blowout loss at Minnesota on Saturday. But Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said the 24-year-old Williams keeps improving because he has the right approach to the game. He is averaging 23 points on 49% shooting from the field and 50% shooting from 3-point range in the series.",
      "\u201cThe thing I\u2019m impressed with about him is his ability to learn from his experiences very quickly is impressive,\" Daigneault said. \u201cHe had some games in the Denver series that he wasn\u2019t great offensively. He just looks at it in a very intentional way and improves.\u201d",
      "Where some players' growth can be measured year by year, Williams seemingly takes steps daily.",
      "\u201cI just think his carryover and his growth from game to game is exciting,\u201d Daigneault said. \"He\u2019s still a young player, as great of a player as he is.\u201d",
      "Williams helped the Thunder overcome a game from a Timberwolves team that did a lot of things right. The Wolves shot 51.2% and made 18 3s in Game 5. Before Monday's game, teams that shot 50% or better from the floor and made 18 or more 3s were 55-0 in the playoffs.",
      "Randle wasn't responsible for the fireworks. After posting 28 points in Game 1 and 24 points in Game 3, he scored five points on 1-for-7 shooting and had five turnovers in Game 4.",
      "He also had a 2-for-11, six-point clunker in a Game 2 loss.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to figure out a way to get myself in position to be more aggressive, rather than just standing, spectating or trying to crash the glass,\u201d he said. \"Or, I can just find other little things to do.\u201d",

      "Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott says edge rusher Joey Bosa is expected to miss all of the team\u2019s spring practices because of a calf injury as the team opened its first voluntary session",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Buffalo Bills veteran edge rusher Joey Bosa is expected to miss all of the team\u2019s spring practices because of a calf injury, coach Sean McDermott announced Tuesday as the team opened its first series of voluntary sessions.",
      "McDermott said Bosa was hurt while working out with the team last week, and he expects the player entering his 10th NFL season to be ready for the start of training camp in late July.",
      "\u201cYeah, I mean, listen, it is concerning. Durability, availability are key ties to our roster,\u201d McDermott said of Bosa\u2019s recent injury history, which led to him being released by the Los Angeles Chargers this offseason.",
      "\u201cAnd so we basically look ahead in terms of what he\u2019s doing now, which is getting himself the treatment that he needs and he\u2019s working hard at it,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all that he can control right now. And we get him back when we get them back probably at this point, training camp.\u201d",
      "The Bills signed Bosa to a one-year, $12.6 million contract in March in the hopes that he can reestablish himself as one of the NFL\u2019s premier pass rushers. Bosa, who turns 30 in July, is coming off three injury-shortened seasons in which he was limited to playing in 28 games because of groin, foot, hip and back issues.",
      "His 72 sacks are tied for 10th most in the league since 2016, though he has combined for only 14 over the past three years.",
      "Also, McDermott said running back James Cook was the only player not in attendance. Cook is entering his fourth season and is coming off a season in which he finished tied for the NFL lead and matched a team single-season record set by O.J. Simpson in 1975 with 16 TDs rushing touchdowns.",
      "Cook has gone on social media this offseason to express his desire to seek an extension to his contract, which expires after this upcoming season.",
      "General manager Brandon Beane said in March that he was moving on from negotiations with Cook to focus on the draft. And Cook has been the odd player out after Beane signed quarterback Josh Allen, receiver Khalil Shakir, linebacker Terrel Bernard, edge rusher Greg Rousseau and cornerback Christian Benford to long-term extensions over the past three months.",
      "Cook has been working out on his own in Florida, and McDermott said he\u2019s been in regular contact with the player.",
      "\"James will be here when he\u2019s ready to be here and we move forward.\u201d",

      "Novak Djokovic has returned to Roland-Garros with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 victory over Mackie McDonald in the first round",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic experienced the lowest of lows \u2014 pulling out of the French Open after tearing the meniscus in his right knee \u2014 and the highest of highs \u2014 winning a long-sought Olympic gold medal for Serbia \u2014 at Roland-Garros last year. This trip to the site went smoothly, once he got going.",
      "Other than some first-set interruptions by, and lengthy discussions about, the windy, wet weather, the 24-time major champion was unbothered during a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 victory over 98th-ranked Mackie McDonald of the United States at Court Philippe-Chatrier in the first round.",
      "\u201cHe makes it seem like a video game, almost, for him,\u201d said McDonald, a 30-year-old Californian who played college tennis at UCLA and twice has been to the fourth round at Grand Slam tournaments. \u201cHe\u2019s able to just do so much. I don\u2019t even think he was playing his best tennis or his highest level. But if I pushed him to a different point, he would bring it up.\u201d",
      "One example: When McDonald earned his first break points, getting to love-40 at 3-2 in the second set, Djokovic came up with three big serves, a 120 mph (193 kph) ace, a 123 mph (199 kph) ace and a 122 mph (197 kph) service winner.",
      "Djokovic compiled 32 winners \u2014 18 more than McDonald \u2014 and just 20 unforced errors in a match that eventually was played with the lights on and the retractable roof closed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a competitor, and losing stings,\u201d McDonald said, \u201cbut playing Novak on that court is something I\u2019ll remember.\u201d",
      "Before Djokovic, who just turned 38 and won his 100th career title last weekend, walked onto the playing surface, he was identified by the stadium announcer by his total number of Slam trophies, the three he's won at the French Open, and the Summer Games gold he won \u201chere in Paris.\u201d",
      "\u201cI still remember last year\u2019s Olympic Games. It was the last time I was here,\u201d Djokovic said afterward. \u201cThe emotion is very strong.\u201d",
      "The medal that means so much to him?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the medal with me. But I have a picture of the medal in my bag,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medal is with my father. My dad likes trophies more than I do, so I gave him mine.\u201d",
      "Once Coco Gauff found her rackets \u2014 a relatively important piece of equipment for a tennis player \u2014 all was well for her in the first round. Gauff showed up on court, opened her bag and peered inside to find it was missing her rackets. The start of the warmup was delayed, but then everything went Gauff's way, and the 2023 U.S. Open champion got past Olivia Gadecki 6-2, 6-2. Other winners included the No. 3 seeds, Jessica Pegula and Alexander Zverev, and 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, but 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who was seeded 11th, lost to Cam Norrie 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5 across nearly four hours.",
      "The second round begins on Day 4, with a schedule that includes defending champions Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz, 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini and two-time finalist Casper Ruud. Swiatek meets 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu in the day session's last match in the main stadium.",

      "Berlin has formally presented its bid to rehost the Olympic Games",
      "BERLIN -- Berlin has formally presented its bid to rehost the Olympics in the same stadium where Jesse Owens starred during the 1936 Games under the Nazis.",
      "Berlin Sports Minister Iris Spranger on Tuesday said the city wants to put on a sustainable Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2036, 2040 or 2044, by refurbishing existing sports venues.",
      "But her announced plans to include the former airport Tempelhof are likely to be resisted by locals who already opposed any development of the popular city park in a 2014 referendum.",
      "Spranger envisaged beach volleyball at the Brandenburg Gate, and water sports in Gr\u00fcnau, a riverside locality which also staged water sports in 1936.",
      "Otherwise, Spranger gave few details during the presentation, saying the bid was still at concept phase.",
      "\u201cYou'll have to be patient,\u201d she told a journalist.",
      "Many Berliners are against the idea of staging the Olympics at all, regardless of them potentially taking place on the 100th anniversary of the Games already hosted by the Nazis. An initiative called \u201cNOlympia Berlin\u201d has already announced plans to block it by collecting enough signatures to force a referendum.",
      "Munich's bid to host the Winter Games in 2022 and Hamburg's hopes of hosting the Summer Games in 2024 were both foiled by referendums.",
      "Spranger said she was against a referendum, saying she preferred \u201cdialogue with one another. Not just yes or no, but that the public really knows what we're planning.\u201d",
      "But for that, Tuesday's presentation was little help.",
      "Local politician Klara Schedlich of the opposition Green party spoke against the bid.",
      "\u201cOur tax money is better spent on sports clubs than the IOC,\u201d Schedlich said, referring to the International Olympic Committee.",
      "Berlin\u2019s bid \u2014 titled \u201cBerlin+\u201d with support from the states of Brandenburg, Saxony, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Schleswig-Holstein \u2014 is to be presented to the German Olympic Sports Confederation (DOSB) before an end-of-month deadline.",
      "International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons said Wednesday that another bid would be \u201cvery positive\u201d sign for future Games. He\u2019s also a member of the IOC\u2019s Future Host Commission.",
      "\u201cThe more quality bids we have to work with, the better,\u201d Parsons, who was in Brisbane, Australia meeting organizers of the 2032 Games, said. \u201cWe can compare different Games propositions ... the different visions for different Games going to different parts of the world.",
      "\u201cSo if they (Berlin) put together a good bid, I think it\u2019s very welcome.\u201d",
      "It will be up to the DOSB to decide which Games to bid for. Los Angeles is hosting the 2028 Olympics and Brisbane the 2032 Olympics, so the next available edition will be 2036, the 100th anniversary of the Berlin Games.",
      "\u201cI believe that the 2036 Games, regardless of where they take place, will also focus on the Nazi Games of 1936. That\u2019s part of history and attention will be paid to it,\u201d Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner said. \u201cI have to tell you, I\u2019m proud to be the governing mayor of a city that has changed in the last 100 years, that we no longer stand for dictatorship, exclusion, and mass violence, but that Berlin is now a cosmopolitan, international metropolis, a colorful, diverse city.\u201d",
      "The DOSB previously said a German bid for 2040 was also possible. Munich, Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia also plan bids. A final decision on a German bidder is expected by fall next year.",
      "\u201cIt's important for Germany to make a bid. We\u2019re making an offer here today,\u201d Wegner said.",
      "The formal presentation took place in the same battle-scarred stadium, Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion, where Adolf Hitler watched Owens, the Black American athlete, win four gold medals in the 1936 Games, dealing a blow to Hitler's notions of racial superiority.",
      "Hitler was personally involved in the design and construction of the 100,000-seat track-and-field stadium after the Nazis assumed power in 1933, two years after the Games were awarded to the city.",

      "Kristina Smithe was running a marathon in California a few years ago when she started thinking about all the waste such events produce \u2014 especially the blizzard of disposable paper cups that can pile up at water spots",
      "Kristina Smithe was running the California International Marathon in 2019, grabbing cups of water to stay hydrated, when she started to think about how much waste such events produce. On the flight home, she did the math: 9,000 runners, 17 aid stations and something like 150,000 cups used once and thrown away.",
      "\u201cI was just shocked that, even in California, it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Smithe said.",
      "That sparked her idea for something more durable \u2014 a lightweight, pliable silicone cup that could be used again and again. After working out a design, Smithe ordered her first shipment and tested them at a race in 2021.",
      "Now her business, Hiccup Earth, has 70,000 cups that Smithe rents out to interested races to replace the typical white paper cups that can pile up like snowdrifts at busy water stops.",
      "Billions of disposable cups are used around the world each year. These cups are often made of plastic, but even if they are made of paper, they typically have a plastic lining that makes it difficult for them to biodegrade. And making these cups, and disposing or burning them, generates planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just a small subset of the amount of plastic waste that we produce, but it\u2019s a pretty visible one,\u201d said Sarah Gleeson, solutions research manager and plastics waste expert at climate nonprofit Project Drawdown. \u201cIt\u2019s something that generates a lot of waste, and waste \u2014 depending on what exactly it\u2019s made of \u2014 can really last in landfills for hundreds of years.\u201d",
      "As she was getting her business off the ground, Smithe emailed race directors to ask if their event used disposable cups.",
      "\"The answer was always yes,\u201d she said. Her response: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a sustainable solution, I have one.\u201d",
      "Now, she rents out the cups by the thousand, driving them to events in massive totes and leaving bins with the company logo for collection after use. Smithe picks up the used cups and washes them in a proprietary dishwasher.",
      "At the PNC Women Run the Cities race in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, in early May, Smithe helped quench the thirst of thousands of runners, dropping off 17-gallon tote bags full of her flexible blue cups.",
      "After that race, Smithe, 35, estimated she's taken her cups to 137 races and spared 902,000 disposable ones from the landfill. She also says her washing process needs only 30 gallons (114 liters) of water per 1,500 cups. An average efficient household dishwasher uses 3 to 5 gallons (11 to 19 liters) for far fewer dishes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a solution to a problem that\u2019s long overdue,\u201d Smithe said.",
      "One trade-off is that the cup rentals cost race directors more than other options. Disposable cups might run just a few cents each, while 10,000 Hiccup cups would rent for about 15 cents each. That price drops if more cups are needed.",
      "Gleeson, of Project Drawdown, sees the reusable cups as just one of many ways that innovators are looking to cut down on waste. Such solutions often have to be rooted in convenience and grounded in local or small applications to get more people to adopt them. Some cities, for instance, are experimenting with reusable food takeout containers that customers return to nearby drop-off spots later on.",
      "While no one solution can fully tackle the problem, \u201cThe scalability is there,\u201d Gleeson said. \u201cI think in general, high adoption of these kinds of solutions is what is able to bring costs down and really maximize environmental benefits that you could get.\u201d",

      "When Leo entered the Clementine Hall inside the Apostolic Palace where Napoli's players and staff were seated, there was a slight delay before the guests applauded.",
      "\u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t want to applaud because in the media they say I\u2019m a Romanista,\u201d Leo said, referring to Roma fans. \u201cThat\u2019s what the press says. Not everything that you read in the press is true.\u201d",
      "Napoli clinched its fourth Serie A title following a 2-0 win over Cagliari on Friday with goals from Scott McTominay and Romelu Lukaku.",
      "Napoli president and film producer Aurelio Del Laurentiis presented Leo with a Napoli No. 10 shirt \u2014 the same number worn by the late Diego Maradona when he played for the southern Italian team \u2014 with the pope's name on it and featuring signatures from all of the club\u2019s players.",

      "\u201cWe know how popular soccer is in Italy and practically the entire world,\u201d Leo said. \u201cSo, in that respect, the social value of an achievement like this, which is greater than the mere technical-sports aspect, is an example of a team that works together, in which the individual talents are sacrificed for the common good.\u201d",
      "The pope also warned that \u201cwhen sports becomes a business, it risks losing the values that make it educational, and it can actually become un-educational.\"",
      "\u201cI want to make an appeal to parents and sports officials: you need to pay careful attention to the moral quality of the sports experience at the competitive level, because it has an impact on the humane growth of young people,\u201d Leo said.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff caused a brief and amusing delay at the French Open on Tuesday when she stepped onto Court Philippe-Chatrier without her rackets.",
      "Gauff looked confused before a ball boy ran out minutes later carrying her pack of mint-colored rackets.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said the court announcer, drawing laughter, applause and smiles from the crowd in the tournament\u2019s main stadium.",
      "Despite the mix-up, No. 2-seeded Gauff went on to defeat Australia\u2019s Olivia Gadecki 6-2, 6-2 in her opening match.",
      "The American jokingly blamed her coach for the missing rackets.",
      "\u201cHonestly, as long as I\u2019ve been on tour, my coach has always put the rackets in the bag before the match because he\u2019s very superstitious,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m blaming it on my coach. It\u2019s OK.\u201d",
      "Gadecki also found humor in the incident.",
      "\u201cNow that I think about it, it seems like that was the only way I was going to win the match,\u201d she said about Gauff\u2019s empty-handed arrival. \u201cIt was a funny little incident.\u201d",
      "Gauff was a 2022 finalist at Roland-Garros and is among the title contenders again.",

      "Nic Enright thought he would be caught up in the emotions of finally making it to the majors this past weekend",
      "CLEVELAND -- Nic Enright thought he would be caught up in the emotions of finally making it to the majors this past weekend.",
      "Compared to everything he has dealt with the past three years since being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, the 28-year-old Cleveland Guardians right-hander was able to take everything in stride.",
      "Enright threw two scoreless innings and struck out three for Cleveland on Sunday in a 5-0 loss to Detroit. He was called up on Saturday after Hunter Gaddis was placed on the bereavement list.",
      "\u201cI remember feeling calmer and much more at peace than I thought I would,\u201d Enright said Monday before the Guardians' 7-2 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "\u201cAfter I finished warming up and when I jogged in, we stopped for a minute to play \u2018God Bless America.\u2019\u201d he added. \"I used that time to just kind of think of everything that had gone on these last couple of years, all the obstacles that I\u2019ve been through, everything that I and my parents have overcome. And then when the song finished, I was like, \u2018All right, let\u2019s go play baseball.\u2019\"",
      "Enright received his cancer diagnosis in December 2022 after experiencing tightness in his neck. He was surprised about the diagnosis before going through some of the symptoms \u2014 such as getting itchy at night, experiencing night sweats and eczema on his elbow \u2014 and discovering he had all of them.",
      "Enright has been undergoing treatments before and after each season, including four rounds of immunotherapy at the end of last season. He will have four more rounds of immunotherapy at the end of this season.",
      "Cleveland selected Enright in the 20th round of the 2019 amateur draft out of Virginia Tech. The Miami Marlins took him in the Rule 5 draft two weeks before his cancer diagnosis in 2022.",
      "\u201cThere were some dark days, and that\u2019s when I leaned on all those people around me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest thing was not letting cancer control me and not letting it dictate how I was going to live my life.\"",
      "Enright returned to the Guardians organization in 2023. He missed most of last season due to a right shoulder strain, but went 2-1 with a 1.06 ERA in 16 appearances with Triple-A Columbus.",
      "He missed the first three weeks of this season due to a lat muscle injury. When Enright returned, he allowed only two earned runs in nine innings with one save in nine appearances with Columbus.",
      "Enright made the majors after a 17-11 record and 3.13 ERA in 156 minor league games, including two starts. He is wearing No. 59 with Cleveland, the same number worn by Carlos Carrasco for 12 seasons. Carrasco was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in 2019 and returned to pitch for Cleveland later that season.",
      "Coincidentally, Enright's big league debut came in Detroit when the Tigers were hosting Strikeout Cancer Weekend.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t draw it up. It\u2019s just one of those cool things,\u201d manager Stephen Vogt said. \u201cJust to see all that he\u2019s persevered through different organizations, coming back to Cleveland and getting to make his major league debut with the Guardians. It was a really special day for Nic and his family and really fortunate we were there to watch it.\u201d",
      "Enright said he has received plenty of text messages the past couple days, but one of the more meaningful ones came from Boston's Liam Hendriks, who recently returned to the majors for the first time in two years after battling non-Hodgkin lymphoma and recovering from Tommy John surgery.",
      "Even though Enright has reached a couple of significant milestones, he doesn't want his story to end with what happened Sunday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m super happy with how yesterday went, but the goal isn\u2019t to just debut,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to come up here, take the ball every time my name is called and do everything I can to help this team win games.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "For Novak Djokovic, this is a relatively easy call",
      "PARIS -- For Novak Djokovic, this is a relatively easy call: He, like many players, thinks the French Open is making a mistake by eschewing the electronic line-calling used at most big tennis tournaments and instead remaining old school by letting line judges decide whether serves or other shots land in or out.",
      "Plenty of sports, from soccer and baseball to the NFL, are replacing, or at least helping, officials with some form of high-tech replays or other technology. Tennis, too, is following that trend, except at Roland-Garros, where competition continues through June 8.",
      "Even the longest-running and most tradition-bound of the majors, Wimbledon, is \u2014 gasp! \u2014 abandoning line judges and moving to an automatic system this year. The WTA and ATP added machine-generated rulings this season for tour events on red clay, the surface at the French Open. But Grand Slam hosts can do what they want, and the French tennis federation is keeping the human element.",
      "Djokovic, the 24-time major champion scheduled to play his first-round match in Paris on Tuesday, understands why folks might prefer the way to keep things the way they were for more than a century in his sport. He gets why there could be an inclination to shy away from too much change in a world now drowning in cell phones and streaming and social media.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to give everything away to the technology, right? But if I have to choose between the two, I\u2019m more of a proponent of technology. It\u2019s just more accurate, saves time, and ... (means) less people on the court\u201d said Djokovic, 38, who was disqualified from the 2020 U.S. Open for inadvertently hitting an official with a ball hit out of frustration between games.",
      "That edition of the tournament in New York only placed line judges on its two largest courts, while others used an electronic setup, a nod to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Australian Open got rid of all line judges in 2021, a first at a tennis major; the U.S. Open did the same later that year.",
      "The French Open remains a holdout, and that's not likely to change anytime soon.",
      "\u201cUnless the players are unanimous and come to us and say, \u2018We won\u2019t play if there isn\u2019t a machine\u2019 ... then I think we\u2019ve got a great future ahead of us to maintain this style of refereeing,\u201d French federation president Gilles Moretton said, while boasting of the quality of his country's officials.",
      "Players don't sound that adamant, although they tend to echo the opinion of 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, who is 21: \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like the \u2018Gen Z\u2019 in me, but I think if we have the technology, we should use it.\u201d",
      "Still, there is some charm to be found in the choreography of players insisting a call was wrong and chair umpires climbing down for a closer look at a ball mark on the clay. Watch a day of TV coverage from Paris and odds are good that dance will take place \u2014 probably more than once.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what makes clay special, in a way \u2014 that you can always review the shots. ... Obviously, you can\u2019t deny that electronic line-calling is the future, and everything is moving towards AI and artificial intelligence,\u201d said Stefanos Tsitsipas, the runner-up to Djokovic at Roland-Garros four years ago. \"But me, personally, I wouldn\u2019t mind playing on clay with maybe the judgment of a human instead of a robot.\u201d",
      "No matter the form of officiating, there invariably are times when athletes \u2014 perhaps eyesight or faith strained by heat-of-the-moment tension and an eagerness to be correct \u2014 just won't agree with a call.",
      "That, in turn, can lead to extended arguments and sometimes a scene seen recently: A player grabs a cell phone from the sideline to snap a photo of a mark in a bid to prove, and win, a point.",
      "Aryna Sabalenka, a three-time Slam champ and No. 1 women's player, and Alexander Zverev, a three-time major finalist, did just that, although they weren't the first. Back at the 2013 French Open, Sergiy Stakhovsky put down his racket and took a picture of where a ball had landed during a loss to Richard Gasquet; Stakhovsky said then he'd done it before.",
      "\u201cLinespeople mess up sometimes,\u201d said 2023 Australian Open semifinalist Tommy Paul. \u201cAutomatic line-calling is going to mess up probably less.\u201d",

      "Even the NBA MVP needs a wing man, and Gilgeous-Alexander has two. Williams and Chet Holmgren were so good in their own ways that a 40-point, 10-assist, nine-rebound performance by Gilgeous-Alexander on Monday night was somehow overshadowed.",
      "Williams had 13 of his 34 points in the first quarter to give the Thunder the scoring to match their tenacious start after a 42-point loss in Game 3. He shot 13 for 24, including 6 for 9 from 3-point range, and pitched in three of the team's 14 steals.",
      "\u201cFrom start to finish, he picked his spots great, he was aggressive, stepped into everything,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cHe was who he is. He\u2019s gotten all these awards this year for a good reason, and he proved it tonight. He\u2019s a really good basketball player. It\u2019s crazy to think he\u2019s so young and what he has already achieved.\u201d",

      "\u201cOn both ends of the floor, he affects the game at such a high level,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s crazy because he\u2019s out there just running around right now. We rarely call plays for him. He rarely gets anything set for him.

We\u2019ve just grown up together. Obviously Shai\u2019s a little bit older than us, but we\u2019ve been through a lot of experiences in a short amount of time that have either forced us to trust each other or grow apart, and we\u2019ve grown closer to each other.",
      "\"That\u2019s just kind of how we play \u2014 live and die by trusting each other, and whatever happens from there happens.\u201d",

      "\u201cSixteen has had more traction in my league than I would've anticipated,\u201d Greg Sankey said Monday at the kickoff of the league's annual meetings.",
      "A move to 14 teams had been widely viewed as the next expansion, but Sankey said \"16 has become more central in the conversation. We're interested, not committed, but the interest level has gone higher.\u201d",
      "The future of the playoff will be among the topics discussed among school presidents, athletic directors and coaches in what might be the most consequential of the many conference meetings taking place this spring.",
      "Last week, all 10 conferences and Notre Dame provided the unanimous agreement needed to move to a straight seeding model for next year's playoff, which will remain a 12-team affair.",

      "SpaceX has launched its Starship mega rocket again after back-to-back explosions",
      "After back-to-back explosions, SpaceX launched its mega rocket Starship again on Tuesday evening, but fell short of the main objectives when the spacecraft tumbled out of control and broke apart.",
      "The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.",
      "CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced \u201ca rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or burst apart. \u201cTeams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,\u201d the company said in an online statement.",
      "Musk noted in a post on X it was a \u201cbig improvement\u201d from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.",
      "It was the first time one of Musk's Starships \u2014 intended for moon and Mars travel \u2014 flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.",
      "Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.",
      "\u201cNot looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\u201d said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield during a controlled reentry.",
      "Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.",
      "The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.",
      "Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft\u2019s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.",
      "NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship \u2014 the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built \u2014 in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year\u2019s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",

      "The soil was removed from across the Fukushima prefecture as part of decontamination work following the 2011 nuclear disaster and has since been in interim storage. Some of it has since reached levels safe enough for reuse, officials say.",
      "Using the soil at Ishiba's office in Tokyo is aimed at reassuring the public it is safe. The government said that it plans to reuse the soil for flower beds and other purposes within the grounds of government agencies. The plan is based on guidelines set by the Environment Ministry in March and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "The Fukushima disaster resulted in large amounts of radioactive materials spewing out from the plant, polluting surrounding areas.",
      "Japan is stuck with large volumes of the dirt, chopped trees and other debris collected during intensive decontamination work. It has 14 million cubic meters of dirt and other materials \u2014 enough to fill 11 baseball stadiums \u2014 stored at a sprawling outdoor facility straddling the towns of Futaba and Okuma, near the Fukushima plant.",
      "The government is aiming to find disposal sites for the soil by 2045, with officials suggesting low risk material could be used to build roads and in other public works projects across the country.",
      "The Environment Ministry said that the soil will be used as foundation material and safely covered with top soil thick enough to keep radiation at negligible levels.",
      "But there is much public unease. The government has already been forced to discontinue a plan to experiment using some of the soil in flower beds at several public parks in and around Tokyo following protests.",
      "The IAEA is providing assistance with the Fukushima decommissioning process, which requires removing more than 880 tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "In 2023 Japan began discharging treated radioactive wastewater from the plant into the sea to reduce the risk of accidental leaks and to make space to build facilities needed for melted fuel removal.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have pinpointed the oldest known evidence of humans making tools from whale bone.",
      "The bones, fashioned into narrow projectiles for hunting, had been uncovered in excavations dating back over a century in the Bay of Biscay near Spain and France. Scientists figured the tools were quite ancient, but many were small fragments so it was hard to determine their age.",
      "Technological advancements in the past decade have now made it possible to date the oldest of the tools to about 20,000 years ago. Scientists found that the bones came from blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales and other species.",
      "\u201cHumans and whales have clearly been encountering one another for a long time,\u201d said Vicki Szabo with Western Carolina University, who studies the history of whaling and was not involved with the latest research.",
      "Scientists think that ancient humans were crafting whale bone instruments in places including the Arctic and South Pacific. There\u2019s been solid evidence of whale bone tools dating back to about 5,000 years ago, but the new research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications pushes the timeline back.",
      "Ancient humans weren't necessarily hunting whales, said study author Jean-Marc Petillon with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. More likely, they were scavenging the bodies of beached whales and fashioning their dense, heavy bones into tools to hunt reindeer or bison.",
      "The tools indicate that ancient people in the area took advantage of resources near the sea for survival. They likely also collected seashells and fished. Finding such evidence has been difficult as rising sea levels disrupt coastlines across the globe, scientists said.",

      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

      "But today that system is being shaken.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.",
      "The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation\u2019s by 55%.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people\u2019s priorities and continue our innovative dominance,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.",
      "Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold.",

      "Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends \u201cto enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.\u201d She spoke at the launch of the bloc's \u201cChoose Europe for Science\u201d \u2014 which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.",
      "Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution\u2019s \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program.",
      "\u201cOur American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,\" he said of applicants. \"What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.\"",
      "It\u2019s too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.",
      "Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous \u2014 and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world\u2019s leading funder of R&D \u2014 including government, university and private investment \u2014 for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world\u2019s R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d \u2014 139 out of 300 total \u2014 came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school\u2019s ability to enroll international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of \u201cperpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 policies.\u2019\u201d Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school\u2019s research mission.",
      "Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step.",
      "The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States.",
      "Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week.",
      "However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S.",
      "No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity.",
      "Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students.",
      "Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze.",
      "The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. Doing so would strike at the school's ability to fundraise, as wealthy donors often give to tax-exempt institutions to lower their own tax burdens.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers working for Russian military intelligence targeted Western technology and logistics companies involved in shipping assistance to Ukraine, the U.S. National Security Agency said.",
      "The hackers were trying to obtain details about the type of assistance entering Ukraine and, as part of the effort, sought access to the feeds of internet-connected cameras near Ukrainian border crossings, according to the NSA's report on the cyberattack, which was issued late Wednesday.",
      "The cyber campaign sought to penetrate defense, transportation and logistics companies in several Western countries, including the U.S., as well as ports, airports and rail systems. The report didn\u2019t specify which types of aid Russia was surveilling, but Ukraine\u2019s allies have contributed significant amounts of military and humanitarian assistance since the war began.",
      "More than 10,000 internet-connected cameras were targeted, including private devices and public traffic cameras near critical transportation points, such as ports, rail hubs or border crossings. Most were in Ukraine, though some were in Romania, Poland and other eastern or central European countries.",
      "Officials did not disclose details about the hackers' success or how long they remained unnoticed. The activity detailed in the report began in 2022, the same year that Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "Russia is expected to continue its efforts to spy on aid shipments, and companies involved in aid logistics or shipments should be on guard, according to the report, which was issued jointly by the NSA, the FBI and security agencies in several allied nations.",
      "\u201cTo defend against and mitigate these threats, at-risk entities should anticipate targeting,\u201d the NSA said.",
      "Authorities linked the activity to a Russian military intelligence unit dubbed \u201cFancy Bear\u201d that is well known for its past campaigns targeting the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The hackers used a variety of tactics to gain access, including spearphishing, which involves sending authentic-looking messages to a potential victim that contain links to harmful software or requests for sensitive information.",
      "The Russian team also exploited security vulnerabilities in computer devices used at small and in-home offices, networks that often lack the security measures found in larger systems.",
      "The hackers didn't use particularly innovative techniques, according to Grant Geyer, chief strategy officer at the cybersecurity company Claroty. Nevertheless, the sprawling yet carefully orchestrated effort gives the Russians a \u201cgranular understanding\u201d of the aid sent to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cThey have done detailed targeting across the entire supply chain to understand what equipment is moving, when and how \u2014 whether it\u2019s by aircraft, ship or rail,\u201d Geyer said.",
      "Russia could use the information it obtained to hone its war planning, Geyer said, or to plot further cyber or physical attacks on the supply chain to Ukraine.",
      "Last fall, U.S. intelligence officials issued a public bulletin directing American defense companies and suppliers to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.",

      "The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they\u2019re worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices.",
      "Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it\u2019s giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world.",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:",
      "The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency\u2019s still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn\u2019t rely on a third party \u2013 like a government or financial institution \u2013 for transactions.",
      "Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin more effectively.",
      "Central to bitcoin\u2019s technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what\u2019s known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining.",
      "In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.",
      "In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.",
      "\u201cI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.",
      "Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.",
      "\u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d he wrote.",
      "But the next day, Hanyecz said he\u2019d successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John\u2019s pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d",
      "\u201cA great milestone reached,\u201d said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz.",
      "It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.",
      "By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.",
      "\u201cI mean people can say I\u2019m stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,\u201d Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have known it would take off like this.\u201d",
      "Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.",
      "\u201cIt made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,\u201d Hanyecz said on the television show \u201c60 minutes.\u201d",
      "Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.",
      "After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn\u2019t taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value.",
      "Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning \u2014 a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",

      "The third week of testimony in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking trial resumed on Tuesday with emotional testimony from the rap mogul's former personal assistant, who testified about the violence and threats she said she witnessed on the job.",
      "Crying at points on the witness stand, Capricorn Clark told jurors that she was told she would be \"thrown into the East River\" if she failed a lie detector test about the theft of Combs' jewelry, that she was forced to accompany Combs to confront rival musician Kid Cudi, and how she witnessed Combs beat his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura.",
      "The intense testimony was complicated by an emotional cross-examination, as defense attorneys questioned Clark about her desire to reconcile with Combs and continue working with him.",
      "\"You want to work with him again?\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo pressed after showing messages where Clark sought to reconcile with Combs.",
      "\"I wanted to work in the music industry,\" Clark replied.",
      "Combs faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted on sex-trafficking and racketeering charges. Prosecutors allege he used his music empire -- including his vast wealth and control over his employees -- to run a criminal enterprise that used violence and threats to coerce women into sex and then enforce their silence. The trial has already seen the onetime cultural tastemaker and music industry titan reduced to a drug-addled abuser who led a sex life replete with voyeurism, orgies and prostitutes.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued that Combs' actions, while outside the mainstream, were a private matter and not criminal in nature.",
      "\"If you don't convince him, I'm going to kill all you m-------------.\"",
      "Last week, rapper and actor Kid Cudi -- whose legal name is Scott Mescudi -- told jurors that he believed Combs broke into his home in a spasm of jealousy after he learned Mescudi had been dating Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura.",
      "Mescudi offered few details about the alleged break-in, telling jurors he rushed over to his home after being tipped off by Clark. Once there, he testified he only found traces of Combs' alleged actions, including finding Christmas gifts tampered with and his dog locked in his bathroom.",
      "Taking the stand on Tuesday, Clark testified about that episode, which she said began in the early morning hours of Dec. 22, 2011, when a furious Combs arrived at her apartment with a handgun.",
      "\"He said, 'Why didn't you tell me?' I said, 'I don't know what you're talking about.' He said, 'Who is Scott?' I said, 'I don't know Scott.' He said, 'Kid Cudi,'\" Clark recalled.",
      "When she protested, Clark testified Combs, gun allegedly in hand, told her, \"I don't give a f--- what you want to do, go get dressed.\"",
      "Clark said she was forced to join Combs and a bodyguard named Ruben to drive to Mescudi's home. While Combs and Ruben allegedly entered the house, Clark said she called Ventura to tell her about the break-in, warning Mescudi that he might \"get himself killed\" if he tried to intervene.",
      "Later that day, Clark testified that Combs ordered her and the bodyguard to pick up Cassie and convince Mescudi not to tell police Combs was involved in the break-in at the house.",
      "\"If you don't convince him, I'm going to kill all you m-------------\" Clark recalled Combs telling her. When she returned with Ventura, Clark said Combs, standing in his robe and underwear, began kicking Ventura.",
      "She testified that Combs kicked Ventura repeatedly, \"and each kick she would crouch into more and more a fetal position\" until she was all the way to the street.",
      "Asked why she did not intervene, Clark responded that Combs told her, \"If I jump in, he was going to f--- me up too.\"",
      "Breaking down on the witness stand, Clark told jurors she later called Ventura's mother and urged her to report Combs to the police. \"He's beating the s--- out of your daughter. Please help her. I can't call the police, but you can,\" she recounted to the jury.",
      "Ventura's mother testified last week that after she learned about Combs' threat to release two sex tapes of her daughter, she took out a home equity loan to pay Combs $20,000, which was eventually returned to her.",

      "Cross-examining Clark, Combs' attorneys tried to cast doubt on the former assistant's recollection of the events and suggested she accompanied Combs and Ruben willingly.",
      "\"You went because you were afraid he was going to do something stupid?\" Agnifilo asked. \"I went because he told me he didn't care that I didn't want to go,\" Clark responded. \"I did not want to go and it was not my choice, sir.\"",
      "\"They're going to throw you in the East River.\"",
      "Clark told jurors that working for Combs was fast-paced, intense and required loyalty. Within her first year working for Combs, she said she was forced to take a series of lie detector tests to prove she was not involved with the disappearance of three pieces of high-end jewelry Combs had given her.",
      "After she reported the jewelry missing, Clark testified that she was locked inside the unfinished corporate headquarters of Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment by a bodyguard nicknamed \"Uncle Paulie.\" Taken to the sixth floor of the building, Clark said she found \"a heavy-set gentleman who was chain-smoking cigarettes and drinking black coffee.\" She said the man told her, \"I had been brought to the building to take a lie detector test to figure out what happened to this jewelry.\"",
      "If she flunked the test, she testified that the man told her, \"They're going to throw you in the East River.\"",
      "\"I was petrified,\" Clark said.",
      "Clark said \"Uncle Paulie\" took her five days in a row to the same deserted location inside 1710 Broadway in Manhattan, near New York's famous Carnegie Hall, for lie-detector tests.",
      "\"I wanted to prove my innocence. I didn't like the threats,\" Clark testified.",
      "When she was allowed to return to work, Clark told the jury that Combs never mentioned the lie detector tests or inquired where she had been.",
      "During a cross-examination that hopscotched from time period to time period, Capricorn Clark testified she did not know the connection between Sean Combs and the large man she remembered repeatedly administering the lie-detector test. She testified that Combs suspected her of stealing the jewelry, which had been loaned to Combs for his famous annual July 4 white party in the Hamptons.",
      "\"You don't know what relationship he has to Mr. Combs?\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked. Clark responded that she did not know.",
      "\"I felt that I was somewhat of a protector for Puff.\"",
      "While prosecutors sought to use Clark's testimony to highlight how Combs used his wealth, power, and employees to lead a criminal enterprise, defense attorneys attempted to undercut that narrative by highlighting messages that suggested Clark was eager to work for a man who held a singular position atop the worlds of music and culture.",
      "Clark again broke down in tears and sobs when confronted by several emails she had sent to Combs. One, in 2014, said, \"Hopefully you'll forgive me soon. It's been long enough. I feel like you've forgiven everyone else but me.\"",
      "A second one, in early 2015, said, \"Sending you blessings and love for a new year.\"",
      "More tears flowed when Agnifilo showed Clark an email she sent to Combs on his birthday, Nov. 4, 2015. \"My hope for this year is that you make good on your promise to get over things and actually be my friend again.\"",
      "Defense attorney Agnifilo kept asking why she wanted to work with Combs again.",
      "\"I wanted my life back, sir,\" Clark explained.",
      "\"You want to work with him again?\" Agnifilo asked.",
      "\"I wanted to work in the music industry,\" Clark replied.",
      "Federal prosecutors, resuming their questioning after the cross-examination, suggested Clark returned to work for Combs because he stymied her attempts to work elsewhere in the music industry.",
      "\"He held all the power as it related to me,\" Clark testified through sobs.",

    "summary": "After launch, an apparent propellant leak entered its suborbital trajectory left Starship spinning and mission control unable to control the craft.",
    "story": [
      "\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" SpaceX said.",
      "Elon Musk and SpaceX are getting a little closer to sending humans to Mars, but they still have plenty of work to do.",
      "After the last two test flights ended prematurely with the destruction of the spacecraft, Tuesday's Starship launch demonstrated that the vehicle could successfully reach orbit. However, an apparent propellant leak after the craft entered its suborbital trajectory caused a loss of attitude control, leaving the spacecraft spinning and mission control unable to control the craft.",
      "Without the ability to steer the craft, SpaceX said it re-entered Earth's atmosphere at an angle that is not ideal for its heat shield. As a result, most of it was expected to burn up, with the remaining pieces falling into the Indian Ocean. The company said it cleared a large area of the landing zone to ensure public safety.",
      "The company posted a statement on X reading, \"As if the flight test was not exciting enough, Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly. Teams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's test will help us improve Starship's reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.\u201d",
      "Mounted atop a Super Heavy rocket that's powered by 33 Raptor engines, the uncrewed Starship successfully lifted off from SpaceX's Starbase test facility in South Texas just after 7:30 p.m. ET. The sound of the building shaking was audible as all 33 engines lit on the powerful rocket that propelled Starship past the tower and into its planned suborbital trajectory.",
      "At nearly 400 feet tall, SpaceX says the Starship and its booster are the most powerful rocket system ever developed. And unlike the company's partially reusable Falcon 9, SpaceX aims for Starship to be fully reusable and capable of launching, landing and flying again with minimal maintenance.",
      "Tuesday's launch is part of SpaceX's iterative approach to engineering. With each mission, the company evaluates the data, makes adjustments to the spacecraft, and builds upon its previous successes and lessons learned from failures. Those flight test learnings are applied to future vehicles and missions until Starship is ready for passengers.",
      "For Tuesday's mission, SpaceX made significant modifications to the upper stage based on lessons learned from previous flight tests, including the last two that resulted in the destruction of the Starship.",
      "During Starship's eighth flight test in early March, several engines shut down unexpectedly about 5 1/2 minutes into the launch, resulting in SpaceX losing control of the craft. Communication with the vehicle was lost several minutes later.",

      "After an investigation, the company said a \"hardware failure\" with one of the engines caused fuel to mix and ignite where it shouldn't have. And while the ship wasn't instructed to self-destruct, SpaceX says it likely did so automatically.",
      "As Starship broke up, debris fell across South Florida and parts of the Atlantic, leading to ground stops at nearby airports. Photos and videos shared on social media showed rocket debris streaking across the sky.",
      "A similar failure occurred in January when stronger-than-expected vibrations caused a propellant leak and explosion. In both cases, the upper stage was lost, but the first-stage booster was successfully returned to the launch site and caught using giant robotic \"chopsticks\" attached to the launch tower.",
      "SpaceX said it has made significant modifications to the upper stage based on what it learned from previous flight tests and noted that while both failures occurred around the same time during the missions, the causes were unrelated.",
      "No astronauts were aboard the previous missions, and none were onboard this time.",
      "According to SpaceX, Tuesday's ninth test marked \"the first launch of a flight-proven Super Heavy booster,\" one that flew and returned during the seventh test flight. Of the booster's 33 engines, 29 were also reused from the previous test. Engineers inspected and replaced known single-use components, such as the heat shield, but left the booster mostly intact to study real-world wear and tear.",
      "Unlike the previous two missions, where the heavy booster returned to its launch site, during Tuesday's launch, the booster followed a modified flight path that included a flip before it appears to have exploded while splashing down in the Gulf. Data and video were lost before the booster hit the water, but the company said that it ultimately ended up in the ocean.",
      "After achieving its planned trajectory in space, Starship's upper stage tried to deploy a set of mock Starlink satellites to test its payload deployment capabilities. However, mission control was unable to get the doors open for the test. SpaceX said they will try it again on a future mission.",
      "After the SpaceX Starship exploded in March during that test flight, Musk wrote \u201crockets are hard\u201d on X. On Tuesday evening, it was a stark reminder of just how hard space travel can be.",

      "Solicitor General John Sauer told the court in the filing that a nationwide mandate issued last week by Judge Brian Murphy of the District Court of Massachusetts has created a \"diplomatic and logistical morass\" that is imposing \"significant and irreparable harm\" on the government's efforts to remove criminal aliens.",
      "After a group of detainees said to be headed to South Sudan sued over their alleged inability to raise fears of torture, Judge Murphy issued a preliminary injunction halting any future removals unless detainees were given notice of their destination, at least 10 days to raise concerns for their safety, and 15 days to contest an adverse finding by an immigration officer.",
      "The temporary order applies universally to any individual slated for removal to a third country. The government is required under international law to ensure that migrants in its custody are afforded protections under the Convention Against Torture, of which the U.S. is a signatory. The Trump administration insists it has been in compliance.",
      "\"Based on what I've learned,\" Judge Murphy said during a hearing last week, \"I don't see how anybody could say that these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object. If I was in any of those groups and I was going to be deported to South Sudan, I would need an opportunity to investigate that and to be able to articulate a well-founded fear about why being returned to South Sudan would be would result in torture or death. The department did not do it. In this case, they did not offer any opportunity to object.\"",
      "Sauer told the justices Murphy's move exceeds his authority, \"jeopardizes the public interest,\" and has upended sensitive diplomatic and national security negotiations with third countries. He said all of the detainees to be removed have already received adequate due process and had final orders for removal entered.",
      "\"The district court's invented process offers little but delay. While certain aliens may benefit from stalling their removal, the Nation does not,\" he wrote.",

    "summary": "Trump will pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley who were sentenced to prison for tax evasion and bank fraud.",
    "story": [
      "The reality TV series stars were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud.",
      "President Donald Trump will pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, according to a video posted by Trump's communications adviser Margo Martin on X. The couple was sentenced to prison for tax evasion and bank fraud.",
      "According to the video, Trump called Savannah Chrisley, the couple's 27-year-old daughter, to share the news that her parents were getting pardoned and would be released from prison soon.",
      "Savannah Chrisley appealed to the Trump administration for pardons for her parents and spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention.",
      "The couple, who became famous for their show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison on charges including fraud and tax evasion. Todd Chrisley was sentenced to 12 years in prison and 16 months of probation while Julie Chrisley was ordered to serve seven years in prison and 16 months of probation.",
      "The couple was also ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution.",
      "Asked by ABC News if the White House could provide any background information regarding the pardons, principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields did not provide any details behind the pardons and echoed Trump's comments in the video that the couple were treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cThe President is always pleased to give well-deserving Americans a second chance, especially those who have been unfairly targeted and overly prosecuted by an unjust justice system,\" Fields said in a statement to ABC News. \"President Trump called Savannah and her brother from the Oval Office to personally inform them that he would be pardoning their parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, whose sentences were far too harsh.\"",
      "\"Chrisley Knows Best\" premiered in 2014 and followed the lavish lifestyle of wealthy real estate developer Todd Chrisley and his family.",
      "The charges against the Chrisleys stem from activity that occurred at least as early as 2007, when the couple allegedly provided false information to banks and fabricated bank statements when applying for and receiving million of dollars in loans, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. In 2014, two years after the alleged bank fraud scheme ended, the couple is accused of fabricating bank statements and a credit report that had \"been physically cut and taped or glued together when applying for and obtaining a lease for a home in California.\"",
      "In their sentencing memo, prosecutors said the Chrisleys had engaged in a \"fifteen-year fraud spree.\"",
      "\"After they defrauded community banks out of tens of millions of dollars, they hid millions of dollars from the IRS, all while going on television to boast about how much they spend on designer clothes,\" the memo read. \"And when they learned that they were under investigation for those crimes, they involved their own family members and friends to obstruct justice.\"",

      "The bill now heads to Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "Texas lawmakers have passed a bill that would make it easier for parents to opt out of vaccinating their children, despite the current measles outbreak in West Texas.",
      "The bill -- HB 1586 -- would allow parents to download and fill out a form available on the Texas Department of State of Health Services website to exempt their children from all vaccinations required to attend public school.",
      "Under current state law, a person claiming an exemption from required immunizations must submit a written request to the department requesting an affidavit form. They would then complete an affidavit on a form and disclose the reason for the exemption, according to Texas law.",
      "Republicans have argued it simplifies the process, and saves money, while Democrats have argued it could lessen immunity -- especially during an ongoing measles outbreak.",
      "\"This will save taxpayer dollars in printing and mailing, increase government efficiency, and ensure kids are enrolled in school on time, guaranteeing children their fundamental right to an education,\" Republican state Rep. Lacey Hull, who introduced the bill, said on social media after it passed the House.",
      "Democratic state Rep. John Bryant said on social media, \"This session, over a dozen bills have been filed to weaken vaccine mandates, promote immunization exemptions, and eliminate reporting requirements. Just last month, a second unvaccinated child died from the measles outbreak in Texas. ... The spread of misinformation has led to preventable deaths and hurts our public health. I urge everyone to elect people who put science and the well being of others over political ideology.\"",
      "In addition to measles, Bryant also cited the past benefits of vaccination against polio and, more recently, COVID-19.",
      "As of Tuesday, there have been 729 confirmed cases of measles in Texas -- primarily in West Texas -- according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.",
      "There have been two deaths in Texas among school-aged children, according to the department.",
      "The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with two doses of a vaccine against measles, with two doses of the\u00a0MMR vaccine preventing more than 97% of measles infections, according to the department.",
      "Parents or individuals requesting an exemption must sign a document saying they understand the \"benefits and risks of immunizations and the benefits and risks of not being immunized,\" the bill states.",
      "To become law, the bill -- which passed in the Senate on Sunday, 11 days after the House -- needs to be signed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. It would go into effect beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, according to the bill.",
      "ABC News has reached out for comment on whether the governor plans to sign the bill.",
      "Current law requires the department to maintain a record of the total number of affidavit forms sent out each year and provide that information to the legislature.",
      "The proposed bill would allow the department to maintain a record of the total number of times the form was accessed or requested online, but it would no longer be required.",
      "Measles infections in the U.S. have surpassed 1,000 cases, according to most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "This year's total number of cases is the second-highest case count in 25 years, according to data from the CDC.",
      "About 96% of measles cases are among those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, according to CDC data.",
      "At least three deaths have been confirmed this year -- two children and one adult -- all of whom were unvaccinated.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the appeal of a Massachusetts student who was barred from wearing a T-shirt to school proclaiming there are only two genders.",
      "The justices left in place a federal appeals court ruling that said it would not second-guess the decision of educators in Middleborough, Massachusetts, to not allow the T-shirt to be worn in a school environment because of a negative impact on transgender and gender-nonconforming students.",
      "Educators at the John T. Nichols Middle School barred the student from wearing the T-shirt and an altered version with the words \"two genders\u201d covered up by tape with the word \u201ccensored\u201d written on it.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.",
      "The court should have heard the case, Alito wrote, noting that \u201cthe school permitted and indeed encouraged student expression endorsing the view that there are many genders,\u201d but censored an opposing view.",
      "\u201cThis case presents an issue of great importance for our Nation\u2019s youth: whether public schools may suppress student speech either because it expresses a viewpoint that the school disfavors or because of vague concerns about the likely effect of the speech on the school atmosphere or on students who find the speech offensive,\u201d Alito wrote.",

      "Former New York Rep. Charles Rangel, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus who spent more than four decades in the House, died on Monday, according to his family. He was 94 years old.",
      "Rangel, a Democrat, served in the House from 1971 until 2017, spending part of his tenure as the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.",
      "\"A towering figure in American politics and a champion for justice, equity, and opportunity, Congressman Rangel dedicated over four decades of his life to public service,\" his family said in a statement about his death.",
      "While in Congress, Rangel -- often referred to as the \"Lion of Lenox Avenue\" by his Harlem district -- achieved many notable firsts during his 46 years in Congress: he was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971 and became the first Black chair of the Ways and Means Committee in 2007.",
      "He stepped down from leading the Ways and Means Committee amid an ethics scandal for violating House rules. Rangel was accused of 13 counts of violating those rules, but emphatically denied any wrongdoing. Ultimately, Rangel was found to have violated 11 separate rules of the House and was censured -- a public shaming in the well of the chamber.",
      "That vote made him the 23rd member of the House to be censured -- and the first in nearly 30 years.",
      "Still, after being embroiled in the scandal, Rangel was reelected and went on to serve two more terms in Congress -- and was still widely respected. As he was censured, he talked about being wounded in the Korean War -- for which he received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star with Valor -- and not having another bad day since.",
      "After leaving Congress, Rangel served as statesman-in-residence at The City College of New York, its website said.",
      "\"Rangel was a war hero, history-making congressman, and master lawmaker,\" the college wrote on its website, later adding that he was \"recognized as one of the hardest working legislators in Congress.\"",
      "His family added that his legacy lives on through the school's Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service, \"which continues to inspire and train new generations of public servants.\"",
      "'Transformational force of nature'",
      "After news of his death, tributes came in from those who worked with the former congressman and those who valued the work he did.",
      "The Congressional Black Caucus mourned the passing of one of its \"trailblazing\" founders, calling him \"the very definition of a life devoted to public service.\"",
      "\"His legacy is one of tireless advocacy, historic firsts, and unwavering dedication to justice and equality. May he rest in power and everlasting peace,\" Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke said in a statement.",
      "House Minority Leader and fellow New Yorker Hakeem Jeffries honored Rangel Monday morning, acknowledging his service in the military and Congress in a post on X.",
      "\"Rep. Charlie Rangel was a phenomenal patriot, hero, statesman, leader, trailblazer, change agent & champion for justice. The Lion of Lenox Ave was a transformational force of nature. Harlem, NYC & America are better today because of his service. May he forever rest in power,\" Jeffries posted on X.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted to X on Monday that Rangel \"was a great man, a great friend, and someone who never stopped fighting for his constituents and the best of America.\"",
      "\"The list of his accomplishments could take pages, but he leaves the world a much better place than he found it,\" Schumer said.",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, called Rangel \"an impactful legislator and a lifelong voice for the voiceless and champion of the oppressed.\"",
      "\"Throughout his decades of public service, Chairman Rangel was a skilled, relentless advocate for justice, for equality and for the people of Harlem,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"May it be a comfort to his loving wife Alma, their beloved children Steven and Alicia and the entire Rangel family that so many mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time.\"",

      "Despite repeated claims from the White House that President Donald Trump's Thursday night gala for the top holders of his cryptocurrency meme coin had nothing to do with his official duties, several of those investors visited the White House Friday afternoon for what they described as a special VIP event, the attendees told ABC News.",

      "Thursday night's black tie event, held at Trump's Washington-area golf club, was attended by around 200 cryptocurrency traders, including many from overseas, who gained admission through a contest that awarded invitations to the top investors in Trump's meme coin -- with at least some of the funds flowing directly into the Trump family's coffers.",
      "Critics have blasted the gala as a \"pay for play\" event in which investors who poured millions into Trump's crypto coin got special access to the president.",
      "News that top $TRUMP coin investors visited the White House appeared to contradict White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's assertion Thursday that the president was attending the crypto gala in a personal capacity, and that since the dinner did not take place at the White House, it was separate from his official duties.",
      "\"The president is attending [the dinner] in his personal time,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"It is not a White House dinner. It's not taking place here at the White House.\"",

      "And late Friday, Justin Sun, a Chinese crupto mogul and the top investor in Trump's meme coin, posted a highly produced video of his White House tour, writing on X, \"Was an honor to be invited to tour the @WhiteHouse. Such a privilege to see it in person.\"",
      "In addition to his multimillion-dollar investment in the $TRUMP coin, Sun has also invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another Trump-backed crypto venture. One month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun.",
      "The Trump meme coin's website at one point earlier this month advertised a \"Special VIP White House tour\" for the top 25 meme coin holders as part of the contest -- but as of last week, the site said only that a \"Special VIP tour\" would be arranged, without mentioning the White House.",
      "The site also included a disclaimer saying the tour was being arranged by the Fight Fight Fight LLC, and that the president himself would be appearing as a \"guest.\"",

      "The conference, co-sponsored by France and Costa Rica, takes place in Nice on the French Riviera from June 7 to June 13. It is expected to bring together more than 60 world leaders, dozens of ministers, about 4,000 government officials and 6,000 members of civil society, Li told The Associated Press.",
      "Costa Rica\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Maritza Chan Valverde said accelerating action to conserve and use the ocean sustainably \u201cmeans cutting decision-making time from years to months\u201d and engaging all 193 U.N. member nations, more than 1,000 cities and over 500 corporations simultaneously.",
      "\u201cWhat is different this time around?,\u201d she said. \u201cZero rhetoric. Maximum results.\u201d",
      "Valverde said she expects participants to make commitments totaling $100 billion in new funding to address the crisis facing the oceans.",
      "France\u2019s U.N. Ambassador J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonnafont said his country\u2019s priorities for the conference include obtaining 60 ratifications for the treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas adopted in March 2023 so it goes into effect. The treaty's mission is to ensure sustainable fishing, mobilize support to protect and conserve at least 30% of the oceans\u2019 waters, fight plastic pollution, \u201caccelerate decarbonization\u201d of maritime transportation and mobilize financing.",
      "Conference participants are expected to adopt a declaration that says action is not advancing fast enough to address the impact of \u201cthe triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe underscore the central role of a healthy and resilient ocean in sustaining life on Earth, ensuring global food security, and supporting billions of lives,\u201d the final draft says.",
      "It supports new scientific research to meet the challenges of climate change and improve the scientific understanding of the oceans. It does not address the issue of deep-sea mining because a consensus could not be reached, Li said.",
      "The Trump administration said last week that it will consider selling leases to extract minerals from the seabed off the South Pacific island of American Samoa, a potential first step in a wider industry push to allow deep-sea mining, which environmentalists oppose because they say it could irreparably harm marine ecosystems.",
      "The declaration and voluntary commitments from governments and all sectors are expected to become the Nice Ocean Action Plan.",

      "Former NBA star Shawn Kemp has pleaded guilty to an assault charge for shooting at two men inside a vehicle in a Washington state mall parking lot",
      "TACOMA, Wash. -- Former NBA star Shawn Kemp pleaded guilty to an assault charge on Tuesday for shooting at two men inside a vehicle in a Washington state mall parking lot.",
      "Kemp, 55, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault in Pierce County Superior Court in Tacoma as part of a plea agreement, according to the county Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office. The Toyota 4Runner the men were inside and another vehicle were damaged in the March 2023 shooting, but the men were not hurt.",
      "Kemp was initially charged with one count of first-degree assault with a firearm enhancement, but prosecutors last week added another count of assault as well as a drive-by shooting charge, The Seattle Times reported. Convictions on those charges could have resulted in a lengthy prison term.",
      "He will be sentenced in August. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Thomas Howe recommended that Kemp be sentenced to nine months in jail, one year of Department of Corrections supervision and support after he is released, and to pay restitution.",
      "Kemp, a six-time NBA all-star who played for the Seattle SuperSonics from 1989 to 1997, declined to comment to the newspaper on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cShawn is committed to moving forward in a positive direction,\u201d Kemp\u2019s attorney, Tim Leary, told the Times. \u201cHe was presented with an offer from the state that allows him to take responsibility, but I think also recognizes the self-defense nature of how this transpired.\u201d",
      "According to court documents filed by Kemp's attorneys, Kemp and several employees who worked at his cannabis dispensary were at a Seattle concert venue when Kemp\u2019s truck was broken into on March 8, 2023. An employee's purse was stolen along with keys to Kemp's business, a cellphone, paperwork and sports memorabilia, including game-worn Gary Payton and Kemp jerseys that were to be auctioned off for charity, the defense's trial brief says.",
      "Using a phone tracking app, Kemp located and briefly tried to talk to the driver of the 4Runner that was circling a casino parking lot, according to the trial brief. The men in the vehicle afterward dumped some of Kemp\u2019s belongings but hung on to the phone, the brief says.",
      "Kemp later saw his phone was near the Tacoma Mall. He drove there, spotted the same 4Runner and \u201cexpressed his understandable frustration\u201d with the driver, according to the brief.",
      "The brief says a man in the back seat \u201cfired off a round from a handgun at Mr. Kemp. Mr. Kemp returned fire and attempted to disable the Toyota. It did not work.\u201d The 4Runner fled and when the vehicle was found abandoned days later, an empty holster was found inside but there was no gun, documents said.",
      "A police call log included in court records indicates that at least one witness who called 911 reported that two men were firing at each other.",
      "Howe, in a statement explaining the plea agreement, wrote that because of the two witnesses\u2019 past crimes of dishonesty and the \u201cfact that those people were illegally in possession\u201d of Kemp\u2019s belongings, the case should be resolved short of trial.",
      "As part of his plea, Kemp cannot have a firearm and will be required to provide a sample for a law enforcement DNA database.",
      "Kemp debuted in the NBA during the 1989-90 season as a 20-year-old who had never played college basketball. He also played for Cleveland, Portland and Orlando and was known for his high-flying dunks.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department has halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for foreign students hoping to study in the U.S. while it prepares to expand the screening of their activity on social media, officials said.",
      "A U.S. official said Tuesday the suspension is intended to be temporary and does not apply to applicants who already had scheduled their visa interviews. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal administration document.",
      "A cable signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press says the State Department plans to issue guidance on expanded social media vetting.",
      "\u201cEffective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consulate sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor visa appointment capacity\" until the guidance is issued, the cable says.",
      "Asked about the suspension at a briefing Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the U.S. uses every available resource to vet people applying for visas.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to use every tool we can to assess who it is that\u2019s coming here, whether they are students or otherwise,\u201d Bruce said.",
      "The move, first reported by Politico, is the latest in the Trump administration's crackdown on international students.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, removing the college from the program that allows schools to sponsor foreign students for visas. That effort was quickly challenged in court and for now is blocked by a federal judge.",
      "This spring the administration also revoked the legal status of thousands of international students already in the country, leading some to leave the U.S. out of fear of deportation. After many students filed successful legal challenges, the administration said it was restoring the students\u2019 legal status. But the government also expanded the grounds for terminating international students' legal status going forward.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s previous administration stepped up scrutiny of all visa applicants, introducing reviews of their social media accounts. The policy remained during President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "An extended pause in scheduling student visas could lead to delays that may disrupt college, boarding-school or exchange students' plans to enroll in summer and fall terms.",

      "Autumn Welch dons a fur coat, leather gloves and a bear mask for work these days, then enters an enclosure to feed and fawn over a 12-pound (5.4 kg) black bear cub who she hopes will consider her family.",
      "The orphaned cub was about two months old when he was found April 12 in Southern California's Los Padres National Forest \u2014 weak, underweight and alone. Since then, the baby bear has been cared for by Welch's team with the San Diego Humane Society in sessions that mimic familial behaviors. The hope is to eventually return the cub to the wild.",
      "The bear costume is meant to stop the rescued cub from bonding with humans. The fur coats are stored in bins with hay scented by black bears. The team went through a few masks before finding one that fit properly.",
      "\u201cMama\u201d is a giant stuffed teddy bear propped up in the corner of a pen at the humane society's 13-acre (5-hectare) Ramona Wildlife Center near San Diego. That's where the cub turns when he's spooked or just wants to snuggle up for a nap, said Welch, the wildlife operations manager.",
      "\u201cHe's probably really missing his real mom,\u201d she said.",
      "When the costumed caregivers enter, the cub treats them like siblings. He rambunctiously plays with them and happily accepts grass and fresh wildflowers to munch.",
      "A milestone was met recently when the youngster learned to dig through soil for worms and insects, \u201cwhich he caught on to pretty quick,\u201d Welch said. Other food is placed in tree branches for him to find on his own. Team members took heart when they recently found the cub snoozing on a tree branch, a common behavior for bears in the wild.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very thoughtful. He\u2019s constantly taking in his environment,\u201d Welch said.",
      "The California Department of Fish and Wildlife tried to reunite the cub with his mother after campers found him. They returned the youngster to the wild overnight, but took him in when she didn't appear. The emaciated 3-pound (1.3-kg) baby bear was then transported to the Ramona wildlife center.",
      "The cub has quadrupled in size since then.",
      "Biologists hope they can return him to the wilderness next year, provided he can learn to find food, seek shelter and avoid people.",
      "The cub is the fourth to enter rehab care in California in the past five years. He could be paired with a buddy if another one turns up, because that would reduce the risk of them imprinting on humans.",
      "In Virginia, employees of the Richmond Wildlife Center last year acted like mother foxes to feed and care for an orphaned kit. Video shows a caregiver in a red fox mask and rubber gloves feeding the tiny animal from a syringe. Like the California cub and his teddy bear, the kit sat on a large stuffed animal fox that was supposed to look like her mother.",
      "The costumed-care technique is relatively new, Welch said, so there's no conclusive research on its effectiveness. But in Ramona, humane society employees wearing coyote masks successfully raised three orphaned pups who have since been released into the wild.",
      "And the humane society is amassing animal masks just in case.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t found a good skunk mask yet,\u201d Welch said.",

      "The court agreed with a judicial conduct review panel's suspension recommendation for Ellen Berz, finding that she deserved more than a reprimand because she behaved impulsively and showed a lack of restraint. The suspension will begin June 26, the court ordered.",
      "\u201cWe believe that the recommended seven-day suspension is of sufficient length to impress upon Judge Berz the necessity of patience, impartiality, and restraint in her work, and to demonstrate to the public the judiciary's dedication to promoting professionalism among its members,\" the justices wrote in the suspension order. Justice Jill Karofsky, herself a former Dane County judge, did not participate in the case.",
      "The suspension order noted that Berz has acknowledged the facts of the case and has accepted full responsibility. Andrew Rima, one of two attorneys for Berz listed in online court records, declined to comment. Her other attorney, Steven Caya, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email.",
      "Berz is the second Wisconsin judge that the state Supreme Court has suspended in the last five weeks. The justices suspended Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan indefinitely on April 29 after federal prosecutors accused her of helping a man evade U.S. immigration agents by showing him out a back door in her courtroom.",
      "A federal grand jury has indicted Dugan on one count of obstruction and one count of concealing a person to prevent arrest. She has pleaded not guilty and is set to stand trial in July.",
      "The Wisconsin Judicial Commission filed a misconduct complaint against Berz, the Dane County judge, in October accusing her of failing to promote public confidence in judicial impartiality, failing to treat people unprofessionally, and failing to performing her duties without bias.",
      "According to the complaint, Berz was presiding over an operating-while-intoxicated case in December 2021. The defendant didn't show up in court on the day the trial was set to begin. His attorney told Berz that the defendant had been admitted to a hospital.",
      "Berz had a staff member investigate and learned that he was in a Sun Prairie emergency room. The judge ordered her bailiff to go arrest him, but was told the bailiff couldn't leave the courthouse. She declared that she would retrieve the defendant herself, and if something happened to her, people would hear about it on the news, according to the complaint. She then left court and began driving to the emergency room with the defendant\u2019s attorney in the passenger seat, the complaint says. No prosecutor was present in the vehicle.",
      "She eventually turned around after the defense attorney warned her that traveling to the hospital was a bad idea because she was supposed to be the neutral decision-maker in the case, according to the complaint. She went back into court and issued a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest.",
      "The complaint also alleges she told a defendant in a child sexual assault case who had asked to delay his trial for a second time that he was playing games and should \u201cgo to the prison and talk to them about all the games you can play.\u201d",
      "When the defendant said her sarcasm was clear, she told him: \u201cGood. I thought it would be. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it to you that way, because I thought you would relate with that.\u201d",

      "Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe is calling lawmakers into a special session to consider aid for tornado victims and incentives for stadiums for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Missouri lawmakers are to kick off a special session Monday to consider aid for tornado victims and a package of financial incentives aimed at keeping the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals from leaving the state for new or improved facilities in neighboring Kansas.",
      "Gov. Mike Kehoe announced the special session Tuesday, less than two weeks after a deadly tornado hit St. Louis and the Legislature wrapped up its work without giving final approval to a late-developing plan that would authorize state bonds for the Chiefs and Royals valued at up to half the cost of the stadium projects.",
      "Missouri officials are scrambling to come up with an offer because Kansas lawmakers last year authorized bonds for up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales, and new sales and alcohol taxes.",
      "\u201cIf Missouri does not put some sort of offer forward,\u201d Kehoe said, \u201cI think the risk is real that they don\u2019t stay here.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs and Royals have played professional football and baseball for five decades in side-by-side stadiums in eastern Kansas City in Jackson County, Missouri, drawing fans from both sides of the split metropolitan area. Their stadium leases run until 2031, and Royals owner John Sherman has said the team won\u2019t play at Kauffman Stadium beyond the 2030 season.",
      "Jackson County voters turned down a sales tax extension last year that would have helped finance a $2 billion ballpark district for the Royals in downtown Kansas City and an $800 million renovation of the Chiefs\u2019 Arrowhead Stadium. That prompted Kansas officials to put together an offer and forced Missouri officials to recalculate their plans.",
      "The Chiefs and Royals are part of a new round of stadium construction that is underway for professional sports teams across the U.S., with taxpayers often helping to pay the multibillion-dollar tabs. Many economists contend public funding for stadiums isn\u2019t worth it, because sports tend to divert discretionary spending away from other forms of entertainment rather than generate new income.",
      "But Kehoe said the teams drive \u201cbillions of dollars in economic activity and tourism.\u201d Supporters of the projects also point to the sense of community and national attention that sports teams can bring, noting the three recent Super Bowls won by the Chiefs and the Royals' World Series title a decade ago.",
      "The proposal would allow Missouri to make 30 years of bond payments equal to the annual state tax revenue generated by the teams in the year before their application for state aid. It also authorizes up to $50 million of tax credits for the stadium projects. Local governments also would have to provide some aid for the teams. The location and total cost of the projects are not specified in the proposal.",
      "The prospects for a special session are uncertain because of tensions in the Missouri Senate. In the final days of the regular session, majority Republicans used rare procedural moves to shut down Democratic opposition and force passage of two measures. One repeals a paid sick leave law approved last November by votes. The other authorizes a referendum on repealing a voter-approved abortion-rights amendment. Democrats vowed to retaliate by slowing down the Senate for a year to come.",
      "The day after the Legislature wrapped up its work, tornadoes struck St. Louis and other parts of Missouri, capping a series of severe storms that also caused damage in March and April. Kehoe is proposing a $5,000 income tax deduction to help offset the cost of insurance policy deductibles for affected people and $25 million to expand eligibility for a state emergency housing assistance program for people living in areas covered by state requests for presidential disaster declarations.",
      "Kehoe's special session agenda also includes spending on constructions projects around the state, including $25 million to help fund a research nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri. That's half the amount that was included in a budget bill that failed to pass the House amid concerns about state spending and conflicts with the Senate. Other proposed projects include a 200-bed mental health facility in Kansas City and new livestock barns at the Missouri State Fairgrounds.",

      "The airline announced the change in March, saying at the time that the the new policy would start with flights booked on Wednesday.",
      "Southwest had built years of advertising campaigns around its policy of letting passengers check up to two bags for free. Under its new policy, people who haven\u2019t either reached the upper tiers of its Rapid Rewards loyalty program, bought a business class ticket or hold the airline\u2019s credit card will have to pay for checked bags.",

      "When President Donald Trump directed his attorney general last month to investigate campaign fundraising, he cited concerns that foreigners and \u201cmalign actors\u201d were laundering illegal contributions to U.S. politicians through the internet",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump directed his attorney general last month to investigate online fundraising, he cited concerns that foreigners and fraudsters were using elaborate \u201cschemes\u201c and \"dummy accounts\u201d to funnel illegal contributions to politicians and causes.",
      "Instead of calling for an expansive probe, however, the president identified just one potential target: ActBlue, the Democrats\u2019 online fundraising juggernaut, which has acknowledged receiving over 200 potentially illicit contributions last year from foreign internet addresses.",
      "Trump's announcement contained a glaring omission \u2014 his political committees also received scores of potentially problematic contributions.",
      "An Associated Press review of donations to Trump over the past five years found 1,600 contributions from donors who live abroad, have close ties to foreign interests or failed to disclose basic information, often making it difficult, if not impossible, to identify them and verify the legality of their donations Among those was $5,000 linked to a derelict building, and $5,000 from a Chinese businessman who listed a La Quinta Inn as his address. Another sizable donation \u2014 $1 million \u2014 was made by the wife of an African oil and mining magnate.",
      "It\u2019s against the law for U.S. candidates and political committees to accept contributions from foreign nationals. Laws also place strict limits on donation amounts and prohibit the laundering of contributions to get around legal caps. For the most part, such donations have been policed by campaigns and the Federal Election Commission, with only the most egregious examples being targeted by federal law enforcement.",
      "But after reclaiming the White House, Trump embarked on a campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies, launching broadsides against universities, law firms and his own former officials. If the Justice Department were to investigate ActBlue, it could imperil a key fundraising tool for Trump\u2019s political rivals before the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans\u2019 threadbare House majority \u2014 and the president's ability to pass an agenda through Congress \u2014 will be on the line.",
      "\u201cThis is him taking direct aim at the center of Democratic and progressive fundraising to hamstring his political opponents,\u201d said Ezra Reese, an attorney who leads the political law division at the Elias Law Group, a leading Democratic firm that does not represent ActBlue. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that they picked their target first. He\u2019s not even pretending.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about Trump's fundraising, including what sort of fraud prevention measures his committees have in place. Instead, a senior administration official pointed to the findings of a recent House Republican investigation of ActBlue that the White House alleges \u201cuncovered specific evidence of potentially unlawful conduct.\u201d",
      "\"The memorandum directs the attorney general to investigate this matter broadly, and she will follow the evidence and take appropriate action as warranted,\u201d said the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the matter.",
      "Neither the Justice Department nor Trump's 2024 campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita responded to requests for comment.",
      "U.S. citizens living abroad are free to donate to politicians back home. But it can be difficult even for campaigns to discern who is allowed to give and whether a person may be serving as a \"straw\" donor for someone else seeking to influence U.S. elections.",
      "The AP identified only two Trump donors out of more than 200 living abroad whose U.S. citizenship was listed as \u201cverified\u201d in the president's campaign finance reports. He received over 1,000 contributions from 150 donors who omitted key identifying details such as their city, state, address or country. Trump also received at least 90 contributions from people who did not give a full name, are listed as \u201canonymous\u201d or whose donations include the notation \u201cname not provided.\u201d",
      "Many of these Trump donors contributed through WinRed, the Republicans' online fundraising platform that is the GOP\u2019s answer to ActBlue. Only about three dozen of these contributions were rejected, most of which came from an unknown source and were paid in cryptocurrency, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "WinRed officials did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cForeign money in our elections is a legitimate concern,\u201d said Dan Weiner, a former Federal Election Commission attorney who is now director of the Brennan Center\u2019s elections and government program. \u201cWhat\u2019s not legitimate is to single out one political opponent and pretend the problem is limited to them.\u201d",
      "Jiajun \u201cJack\u201d Zhang, for example, is a jet-setting Chinese businessman whose Qingdao Scaffolding Co. boasts of being one of the \u201cbiggest manufacturers and suppliers in China\u201d of scaffolding. In October, he used WinRed to donate $5,000 to Trump, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "Zhang lives in China\u2019s Shandong province, according to his LinkedIn account, and is described in French business filings as a Chinese national. But his contribution to Trump lists a La Quinta Inn in Hawaiian Gardens, California, as his address, records show. The donation was made around the time that Zhang posted a photo on social media of his family visiting Disneyland, which is near the hotel.",
      "Zhang did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Other potentially troublesome donations include four from unnamed donors listing an address of \u201c999 Anonymous Dr.\u201d",
      "There is also a series of contributions made through WinRed that listed the donor's address as a vacant building in Washington that was formerly a funeral home. The donor, identified only as \u201cAlex, A\u201d on Trump\u2019s campaign finance report, gave nearly $5,000, spread across more than 40 separate transactions last year. Those types of donations tend to draw scrutiny from campaigns and regulators.",
      "Regulators and watchdogs have also long been concerned about donations from individuals with ties to foreign interests. Trump has received many such contributions, including one in December from Nnenna Peters, the wife of Benedict Peters, a Nigerian billionaire who is the founder and CEO of oil and mining businesses.",
      "Nnenna Peters, who goes by Ella, gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. A naturalized citizen, Nnenna Peters \u2014 who lives in Potomac, Maryland, a tony suburb of the capital \u2014 is allowed to make campaign donations.",
      "Federal law, however, bars U.S. citizens from making contributions on behalf of a noncitizen spouse if the money is not a shared asset. For example, experts said, a husband could be prohibited from making a campaign donation using funds from a checking account solely in his wife\u2019s name.",
      "In practice, such a prohibition is hard to enforce because it is difficult to assess whether spouses are acting on their own accord or on behalf of significant others. Government watchdogs say donations like these raise the risk of an attempt to influence U.S. policy on behalf of a foreign interest.",
      "That was precisely the kind of problem Trump cited in his executive order that singled out ActBlue.",
      "Benedict Peters, as it turns out, has a lot to offer that could be of interest to Trump, who has made the extraction of natural resources a focus on his second administration. In particular, the Trump administration has sought to secure access to critical minerals that help power modern technology. Peters\u2019 Aiteo Group markets itself as one of the largest energy conglomerates in Nigeria, while his company, Bravura Holdings, purports to hold the rights to vast critical mineral deposits across Africa.",
      "His wife\u2019s donation stands out in light of her past giving: She donated exclusively to Democrats, records show, including a $66,800 contribution to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.",
      "\u201cThis clearly could have come from her husband,\u201d said Craig Holman, a registered lobbyist for Public Citizen, a Washington-based government watchdog group. \u201cThis is something the FEC should take a very, very close look at.\u201d",
      "Benedict and Ella Peters did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The questionable donations fit a pattern for Trump, who has in the past exhibited indifference toward campaign finance rules and used his presidential powers to assist those facing legal trouble in such matters.",
      "In January, Trump\u2019s Justice Department dropped its case against former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Nebraska Republican accused of accepting a $30,000 contribution from a Nigerian billionaire. During his first term, Trump pardoned conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza and Republican donor Michael Liberty, who were both convicted of using straw donors to evade contribution limits. He also pardoned former California Rep. Duncan Hunter, who was convicted in 2020 of stealing $250,000 from his campaign fund.",
      "Trump's political efforts have also drawn contributions from straw donors and foreigners who have been subjected to legal scrutiny.",
      "Among them is Barry Zekelman, a Canadian steel industry billionaire, who was fined $975,000 in 2022 by the Federal Election Commission for funneling $1.75 million to America First Action, Trump's official super PAC, in 2018. The contribution helped Zekelman secure a dinner with Trump at which steel tariffs were discussed.",
      "Two Soviet-born U.S. citizens, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were convicted in a straw donor scheme that funneled $325,000 to the same super PAC in the runup to Trump's losing 2020 reelection campaign.",
      "Jesse Benton, a Republican political operative, was convicted in 2022 of serving as a straw donor for a Russian businessman who contributed $25,000 to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.",
      "Democrats say Trump\u2019s focus on ActBlue is a lot to stomach in light of Trump\u2019s acceptance of questionable donations and his seeming lack of interest in enforcing campaign finance laws more generally. They noted that Trump in February fired a commissioner at the Federal Election Commission. The firing, followed by the resignation of a Republican commissioner, has denied the agency the quorum necessary to enforce campaign finance laws and regulations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s telling that while Trump and his allies attack grassroots-funded platforms like ours, their own campaigns have welcomed money from questionable sources,\u201d ActBlue spokesperson Megan Hughes said.",
      "Republicans counter that there is well-founded reason to investigate the Democratic platform, which eased some fraud detection protocols in 2024 before the presidential election.",
      "There is, however, a political upside to investigating ActBlue. The platform has proved more successful than WinRed, the Republican platform designed to imitate it, which took in less than half of the $3.8 billion that ActBlue raised during the 2024 election cycle.",
      "ActBlue representatives declined to say whether they have been contacted by the Justice Department.",
      "ActBlue is expected to battle any investigation. It took a different approach when a Republican-led congressional committee launched an investigation in 2023. That committee\u2019s findings turned out to be the basis for some of the allegations cited by Trump in his executive order.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, are preparing for the worst.",
      "\u201cThere is a pervasive fear that ActBlue could cease to exist,\u201d said Matt Hodges, a veteran Democratic operative who served as the director of engineering for Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst fear people have \u2014 that this will escalate or drain legal resources that hinder their ability to operate.\u201d",
      "He predicted that the Democrats could lose more than $10 million in the short term if ActBlue were forced to shut down. That has led some Democrats to begin thinking about alternatives, but they acknowledged it might be too late to create something as successful as ActBlue with the midterms around the corner.",

      "Some of the most unique living things in the world \u2014 plants that supplement the nutrients they get from sunlight by digesting ants, flies and spiders \u2014 are only found in a small part of North and South Carolina",
      "CAROLINA BEACH, N.C. -- Park ranger Jesse Anderson leads dozens of people on a weekly hike in North Carolina to see some of the most unique living things in the world \u2014 plants that supplement the nutrients they get from sunlight by digesting ants, flies and spiders.",
      "But the Venus flytraps aren't like the human-size, ravenous and cruel Audrey in \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors.\u201d",
      "In the wild, Venus flytraps are the size of a lima bean and pose no harm to anything other than insects. Their special hairs snap their leaves together when brushed \u2014 but only twice in about 20 seconds or less to reduce the amount of false alarms by dust or rain.",
      "Once inside, the insect is doomed to become plant food, Anderson said.",
      "\u201cIt continues to trigger those hairs and the trap slowly closes and eventually starts releasing digestive enzymes to start breaking down the insect. And because they\u2019re in nutrient-poor environments, they supplement their food with insects,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "Anderson's hike at Carolina Beach State Park on the southeast North Carolina coast also showcases other carnivorous plants. There are vase-shaped pitcher plants with liquid at the bottom that traps insects, then digests them. Butterworts and sundews attract insects with glistening leaves, then secrete an adhesive to trap them in place. Bladderworts work similarly to Venus flytraps.",
      "And the hike is one of the few places to see Venus flytraps. The plant only grows in 12 counties in southeast North Carolina near Wilmington and a few nearby places in South Carolina, which made the organism the state's official carnivorous plant in 2023.",
      "Now is an especially good time to take that hike. Venus flytraps bloom from about mid-May to mid-June, Anderson said.",
      "The flytrap is a fragile plant that needs fire to survive. Wildfires in the pine forests where they grow clear off the denser overgrowth to provide the abundant sunlight the plants need.",
      "They face two big enemies \u2014 poachers and development.",
      "Harvesting the plants without permission is a felony in North Carolina and a misdemeanor in South Carolina. In 2016, a man was sentenced to 17 months in prison for taking nearly 1,000 Venus flytraps from game land in Hampstead, North Carolina.",
      "And the flytraps live in one of the fastest-growing parts of the U.S., where neighborhoods and businesses have been built over their habitats. Most of the plants can now be found in preserves and other undisturbed areas.",
      "Scientists counted only about 300,000 flytraps in the Carolinas several years ago.",
      "While Anderson's hike is one of the few ways to see Venus flytraps in their natural environment, he said commercially grown plants can be found around in greenhouses and plant stores around the world and can thrive in homes in the right conditions",
      "\u201cThey like nutrient-poor soils, and also they can\u2019t stand typical well water or tap water. So they need things like rainwater or distilled water or versus osmosis,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "Venus flytraps need abundant sunlight and soils that are moist but not drenched. And they don't have to eat bugs if they can get enough nutrients from photosynthesis.",
      "Please don't feed them hamburger meat \u2014 that's not what they eat. And try not to trigger the leaves shut without something to digest. That takes a lot of energy the plant needs to replace.",

      "MIAMI -- Flamingos, pelicans, herons and parrots are just a few of the wild birds that call Miami home, but it\u2019s the roosters, hens and baby chicks that have come to rule the roost in recent years.",
      "Not only found in residential neighborhoods like Little Havana, Little Haiti and Wynwood, the fowl families are also making their home among the high-rises and government buildings downtown. And while some people find the crowing to be a nuisance, many have adopted the rooster as an unofficial mascot for the city.",
      "Paul George, the resident historian at HistoryMiami Museum, said the chickens are closely connected to the people who have moved to Miami over the decades. For a long time, the domesticated birds were mostly kept in backyards, but George began to notice their feral cousins wandering in public areas about 20 years ago.",
      "He said the chickens have a cultural connection to people who grew up in rural areas of Cuba and other parts of Latin America: \u201cThey\u2019ve always had these hens and roosters around.\u201d",
      "Wild chickens can be found in many Florida communities, from Key West to Tampa to St. Augustine, along with other large cities throughout the U.S., like New Orleans, Houston and Los Angeles.",
      "But Miami's Little Havana truly adopted the birds as a symbol in 2002 when 6-foot (2-meter) fiberglass rooster statues began appearing outside shops and restaurants along Calle Ocho, which is Spanish for 8th Street, as part of a campaign to celebrate the area's culture.",
      "More than two decades later, dozens of the colorfully painted statues, designed by the late artist Pedro Dami\u00e1n, continue to attract tourists seeking fun photo opportunities.",
      "Owner Jakelin Llaguna of Little Havana Visitors Center, a souvenir shop along Calle Ocho, said the community is largely fond of the avian inhabitants, which forage around local businesses and parks.",
      "\u201cThe neighbors have welcomed them,\u201d Llaguna said. \u201cSo they don\u2019t mind if they\u2019re in their backyard or in their front lawn. Nobody messes with them, they\u2019re our mascot.\u201d",
      "Llaguna said the roosters' crowing at sunrise symbolizes renewal.",
      "\u201cThe Cubans came to Little Havana when the revolution came into Cuba,\u201d Llaguna said. \u201cThey settled in this neighborhood, so they had a new beginning in Little Havana.\u201d",
      "Llaguna's store is filled with rooster merchandise, including shirts, hats, glasses and magnets.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants a rooster,\u201d Llaguna said. \u201cThey want to take home a memento. They want have a memory of a fun time. And the rooster has turned into that.\u201d",
      "As the feral roosters spread, they might soon face competition from the invasive peacocks that have taken over neighboring communities like Coconut Grove and Coral Gables.",
      "\u201cThe peacocks have very bad tempers,\u201d George said. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty ill-mannered, and they tend to be a lot bigger than the chickens, and they make a lot of noise.\u201d",
      "But George is more concerned that development and gentrification in older neighborhoods could eventually lead to the disappearance of their feathered residents. When 50-year-old houses are replaced with brand new condos, George isn't sure whether people spending over $1 million for a home are going to tolerate the loud birds.",
      "\u201cEven with hurricane windows, I just don\u2019t think a lot of these people are gonna put up with it as the neighborhood becomes richer.\u201d George said. \u201cAnd I think they\u2019re gonna really lean on the city\u2019s code enforcement for it.\u201d",
      "The legal status of the roosters and chickens is somewhat murky. Both the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County have ordinances that either strictly regulate or completely ban live poultry in residential areas. Meanwhile, the birds freely roam downtown among offices, public parks and courthouses.",
      "Asked about the birds, both city and county officials described their presence as a code compliance issue and referred The Associated Press to their live animal ordinances.",
      "Little Havana resident Donato Ramos Mart\u00ednez enjoys having the roosters and chickens around and even feeds them near the Bay of Pigs Monument, off Calle Ocho.",
      "\u201cThe rooster is the perfect animal for someone to wake up, because they begin to crow at about 4 a.m., from 4 to 5 a.m.,\u201d Ramos Mart\u00ednez said in Spanish. \u201cAnd it is an attractive animal that tourists, both young and old, are excited about, and they take their picture, you know what I mean?\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so I don\u2019t understand,\u201d he added, \u201cwhy there are some \u2014 excuse my language \u2014 some idiots who don\u2019t want roosters or chickens or chicks on the street.\u201d",

      "The couple was sentenced in 2022, with Todd Chrisley receiving 12 years and Julie Chrisley receiving seven years.",
      "The Justice Department said the couple, who starred on \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" submitted false financial statements to obtain more than $30 million in personal loans to pay for their luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel. They used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones and then filed for bankruptcy.",
      "While later earning millions from their reality TV show, the couple concealed their income from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes, while also failing to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "Julie Chrisley was also convicted of obstruction of justice.",
      "In the release announcing their prison sentence in 2022, a Justice Department attorney said \"their lengthy sentences reflect the magnitude of their criminal scheme and should serve as a warning to others tempted to exploit our nation's community banking system for unlawful personal gain.\"",
      "In his call Tuesday with the couple's children, Mr. Trump said the couple received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\"",
      "The couple's daughter, Savannah, has been seeking a pardon for her parents. In an interview with Mr. Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump on Fox News earlier this month, she said her parents had been unfairly targeted because of their celebrity status, adding that prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, had referred to them as \"the Trumps of the South.\"",
      "\"When I saw, obviously, what the president was going through, what my family has gone through, it was very, it was eerily similar,\" she said, comparing her family's case to Mr. Trump's legal troubles.",

      "\"Being 21 and staying up and drinking and smoking and partying after every show does not help. But also, in my case, it does not cause it. My voice always sounded like this, so it's a part of my unique anatomy,\" she explained. \"So I have this very large polyp on my vocal cord, which has given me a lot of the tone and the texture that has made me who I am.\"",
      "But it also makes touring challenging because the condition creates the \"ultimate vocal fry,\" Cyrus said.",

      "Though it's most common in people with a long-term history of smoking, it can also occur in people with chronic acid reflux or repetitive vocal trauma.",
      "Certain types of Reinke's edema can lead to polyp-like growths on one or both vocal folds, the clinic adds.",
      "Reinke's edema is also rare, the clinic notes, affecting less than 1% of the general population.",
      "Reinke's edema symptoms",
      "Symptoms of the disorder include changes in vocal quality or loudness, a gradual deepening of the voice as well as hoarseness or raspiness, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Cyrus said that it can make live performances physically taxing for her.",
      "\"It's extremely difficult to perform with because it's like running a marathon with ankle weights on,\" she said. \"Even when I'm talking sometimes, at the end of the day, I'll call my mom, and she'll go, 'Oh you sound like you're talking through a radio,' and that's how you know I'm really tired because it creates that like ultimate vocal fry.\"",
      "\"My voice is super unique because of it,\" she added.",
      "Reinke's edema treatment",
      "There are a number of ways to treat Reinke's edema, including nonsurgical and surgical options. The Cleveland Clinic notes surgical options include laser therapy to remove vocal fold growths as well as microlaryngoscopy, where a surgeon removes swollen tissue with small tools and a microscope.",
      "Nonsurgical options include speech therapy and treating underlying causes, including quitting smoking or taking medication to reduce acid reflux.",

    "title": "He gained 40 pounds in weeks. It took open-heart surgery to learn why",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-mauceri-pericardial-constriction-nyu-langone-heart-health/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 08:10:59 -0400",
    "summary": "John Mauceri had a complicated health history, but his sudden swelling and fatigue left his team of doctors stumped.",
    "story": [
      "Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence.",
      "In December 2023, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a \"troublesome\" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his left lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later.",
      "Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct.",
      "\"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes,\" Mauceri said. \"Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house.\"",
      "No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms.",
      "\"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain,\" Mauceri said.",
      "Searching for a diagnosis",
      "Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure.",
      "While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But \"the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest,\" the doctor said.",
      "What is pericardial constriction?",
      "Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen.",
      "It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19.",
      "Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.",
      "Mauceri accepted that the surgery was his only option.",
      "\"There was no alternative,\" he said. \"I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'\"",
      "A high-risk surgery",
      "Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's \"heart was trapped\" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said.",
      "\"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped,\" Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said.",
      "Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one.",
      "\"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell,\" Grossi said.",
      "Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.",
      "\"Every day is a miracle\"",
      "After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college.",
      "\"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it,\" Mauceri said.",
      "His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again.",
      "Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success.",
      "Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in October, shortly after his 80th birthday.",
      "\"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore,\" he said. \"I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did.\"",

The condition occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting certain functions,\u00a0according to Johns Hopkins.

The condition is relatively uncommon but is more likely to occur in older people, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. There's no known cause of the condition.",

      "Tyler said, \"What makes me keep going as a writer is a more selfish motive, which is, I'm just always wanting to know what it's like to be somebody else. \u2026 I feel almost deprived that I have just this one life; I have to be greedy and reach out and see, Well, that guy I just passed in the street, he said that strang thing, what is it like to be him? It's just self-indulgence to sit and write all day and pretend I'm somebody else.\"",
      "\"I love listening to people\"",
      "Tyler grew up in a quiet Quaker community in North Carolina. She would tell herself stories to fall asleep at night: \"I would fold my knees up and that would be my desk, and I would be a doctor seeing patients, and I would whisper these conversations. And it always ended with my brother in the bed across the room shouting out, 'Mama, Anne's whispering again!'\"",
      "Something her readers have long heard about, but never seen: her \"blue box,\" full of hand-written notes to herself. I asked, \"Is it fun for you to page through the blue box and go, 'Oh, I forgot I thought about that'?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she said. \"But we should never page through it too often, because then it won't be surprising.\"",
      "The box is filled with ideas and snippets of conversations overheard in grocery stores or coffee shops that she might slip into a book. \"I love listening to people; I like to hear them nattering on,\" she said. \"That's why the pandemic hit my writing career very hard! Because I love to just be walking down the street and you hear somebody say two words, as I go on, I think, I wonder what that was about? And that's where stories begin.\"",
      "No place is more associated with Tyler than Baltimore, Maryland. It's where she and her late husband, Iranian novelist and psychiatrist Taghi Modarressi, raised their two daughters.",
      "So, why does she keep returning to Baltimore as a setting for her stories? \"Laziness,\" she mused.",
      "\"You seem to have a love for the setting,\" I said.",
      "\"But face the fact that if I wrote about somebody in New York, I'd have to find out a bunch of things about New York,\" Tyler said. \"And here I am! But I don't know why it is that I feel there's sort of more there there in the average Baltimorean than there are in people in other places.\"",
      "\"I'm going to be writing this [next] book forever\"",
      "Tyler's latest book, \"Three Days in June,\" details a long weekend in the life of a school administrator, bookended by the loss of her job and her daughter's wedding. At one point the book's main character, Gail, says, \"I'm not the kind of woman who dreams of doing things.\"",
      "I asked Tyler, \"If you could pretend to be anybody, why choose the assistant headmistress at a school in Baltimore, versus a movie star or a head of state?\"",
      "\"You think that's bad \u2013 the current thing I'm working on, the guy remodels kitchens for a living,\" Tyler replied. \"I don't know! I've often asked myself, if I want to be somebody else, why not somebody heroic and crusading out in the world? But I don't get to choose. I always say novels are like olives in one of those tall, thin bottles. You just get out an olive that's on top. This is the one that comes next.\"",
      "But the lives of her characters, and the jobs they have, are anything but humdrum. \"And there is a beauty in the acceptance that people have over their own lives,\" I said. \"Sometimes people just end up in a place like Baltimore.\"",
      "\"They make a life there!\" she laughed.",
      "Now, at age 83, Anne Tyler says she'll keep doing what she has always done: listen, think, and write about people who might shatter your heart, or stitch it back together.",
      "Asked how many more books we might expect from her, Tyler replied, \"Well, I'm going to be writing this [next] book forever, and when I finish it, if I do finish it before I die, I will rewrite it. And if I'm still not dead, I will rewrite it again, because I'm not going to bring out another book. I'm horrified that I have 25 books in a list in the front of this latest novel.\"",
      "\"Isn't that a joy, Anne? Twenty-five books?\" I asked.",
      "\"No!\" she said. \"My next-door neighbor many years ago said, 'You do churn them out, don't you?'\"",
      "\"That comment clearly lingers in your mind.\"",
      "\"It's engraved there, yes!\" she laughed.",

      "\"Amy often paints the skin tone of her subjects, who are Black people, in what we call grisaille, or gray tone,\" said Hockley. \"It kind of disrupts this immediate identification, perhaps even stereotyping that all of us are, you know, subject to.\"",
      "It's not the only way to spot a Sherald painting. Hockley said one characteristic of the artist's work is her subjects' body language: \"Very kind of solid, confident, not over-confident, but just really certain and still in [themselves].\"",
      "The Sherald exhibition, said Hockley, is \"a show that is really speaking to kind of overwhelmingly positive sense of connection, and kind of shared humanity, and kind of beauty that comes from being around one another, that comes from kind of seeing the humanity in another.\"",

      "Doctors, environmental groups and residents are trying to figure out if there is a causal connection between pollutants from the steel industry and rates of cancer in Gary, Indiana.",
      "Pollutants you can see, and tiny particulates you can't, come from different types of industry in the Gary region. But according to Environmental Protection Agency records, steel production plants release the most toxins of all the industries in the region.",
      "Beryl Fitzpatrick is one of the residents affected. You can hear the cancer as she speaks.",
      "\"I was having trouble swallowing,\" she recalled.",
      "Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with Stage 3 tongue cancer. She didn't know if she would ever speak again after doctors removed part of her tongue while removing a cancerous tumor, but she fought to keep her voice.",
      "\"I had to learn phonics. I had to learn, I had to learn words and sounds,\" she said. \"It was humbling.\"",
      "And she knows the very air in her own backyard could be playing a role in her disease.",
      "\"It's almost certain that her place of residence, with the high pollution and other industrial output contributed to her cancer,\" said Dr. Kerstin Stenson, lead of the head and neck cancer program at Rush University Medical Center who's been treating Fitzpatrick.",
      "The City of Gary was built by the steel industry, but when families like Fitzpatrick's moved to the region in droves from the South during the Great Migration for jobs and opportunities, they didn't know as much as we do now about the health risks linked to industrial production.",
      "\"A lot of the teachers would talk about students that had asthma,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "Seven major coal-powered steel production plants operate in the United States. Three plants are clustered in the Gary region: Burns Harbor, Gary Works and Indiana Harbor.",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigators dug into state and federal data from the Environmental Protection Agency to see how these facilities impact the community.",
      "Our investigation found that in 2023, the latest data available, the three mills emitted 25 million pounds of toxins, more industrial pollution than the combined toxic release of the four similar mills in other states.",
      "\"We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,\" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.",
      "Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.",
      "\"The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,\" she said.",
      "The study found people living near one steel production facility have a 12% to 26% higher risk of getting cancer. People in Gary live near three.",
      "And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.",
      "Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.",
      "\"I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,\" Melton said.",
      "The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.",
      "\"What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,\" Mayor Melton said.",
      "Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.",
      "So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?",
      "\"They're responsible for protecting clean air,\" Lewis said. \"And right now, they're not doing that.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.",
      "\"If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,\" Melton said.",
      "Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.",
      "Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.",
      "More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.",
      "U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts \"legally emitted,\" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.",
      "In regards to the Industrial Labs report, U.S. Steel said it was \"designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick has lived in Gary for 60 of her 71 years, never fully knowing what she was exposed to.",
      "\"I didn't think I was living a lifestyle that was polluting my body,\" she said.",
      "She wasn't. Dr. Stenson said Fitzpatrick doesn't have the typical risk factors for her cancer. And she's not alone.",
      "\"There are many patients that have come from that industrial area that would present with head and neck cancer without risk factors,\" Stenson said.",
      "Gary has been notorious for its pollution for decades.",
      "Dr. Mihir Bhayani, also at Rush University Medical Center, is getting closer to directly linking air pollution and some cancers. The new research he is working on could force change.",
      "\"What we are working on currently is, again, a direct causal link between air pollution and head and neck cancer,\" he said.",
      "He believes steel mills are making people sick in Gary, and he wants to see emissions standards toughened.",
      "\"So that individuals who are living in those areas, they're exposed to the same clean air that individuals who are living in more affluent areas are,\" he said.",
      "\"The types of communities that this industry is impacting are disproportionately people of color and low-income communities,\" said Lewis.",
      "More than 76% of Gary's population is Black, and the average income is less than $23,000 a year.",
      "About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.",
      "Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.",
      "\"I am worthy. No matter what you think about my Black skin, my dark skin, I'm worthy. I'm worthy for this community to be cleaned up and I am a person worthy of a good life,\" she said.",
      "Gary and other communities found to be disproportionately impacted by pollution were getting extra help from the federal EPA's Environmental Justice office, but in April it was labeled a DEI program and shut down.",
      "If nothing is done, Bhayani said, there will be long-term effects on people living in communities like Gary.",
      "\"They are going to have higher rates of cancer. They're going to have higher rates of cardiac disease. They're going to have high rates of lung disease,\" Bhayani said.",
      "That's why Fitzgerald, who fought for her voice while still battling the disease that nearly took it, said she'll do whatever it takes to make change here so that it can be different for someone else.",
      "\"As long as I have breath and I can breathe and I have strength to get up, I'm going to join other people, like-minded people. We're going to fight. We're going to fight,\" she said.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs, which owns two of the plants in Northwest Indiana, did not return messages from CBS News Chicago Investigators. U.S. Steel maintains its work is essential to the health of the American economy.",
      "But Fitzgerald and others who live there worry about their own health, and they're asking lawmakers to step up and join their fight for cleaner air.",
      "The CBS News Race & Culture Unit and CBS News Data team contributed to this report.",
      "FULL STATEMENTS",
      "On whether they have studied the impact of releases from Gary Works and the health effects, including cancer and asthma, in the community:",
      "\"In 2020, the EPA deemed that there was an ample margin of safety around iron and steel emissions to protect public health and prevent adverse environmental effects.\"",
      "It is important to note that there are many industrial facilities in Northwest Indiana. Focusing solely on Gary Works as a source of pollution is both incorrect and irresponsible.",
      "On the study released by Industrial Labs:",
      "\"It is clear that these conclusions were pre-determined by a group that describes itself as 'scaling campaigns and building a movement to clean up heavy industry', which is to say that this document is designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions. There are certain interests campaigning to eliminate U.S.-based blast furnaces, which are essential to national security and the health of America's economy because they are the only facilities capable of making certain types and qualities of steels required for critical applications.\"",
      "On residents believing toxic releases would not be allowed at the same level in more affluent communities with different demographics:",
      "\"Federal and state emissions laws and regulations apply equally to any municipality in the same jurisdiction. Gary, Indiana, is no exception. We care deeply about the communities where we live and work, as evidenced by the contributions by the Company and our employees. Since 2020, U. S. Steel Gary Works and its employees have donated over $1.3 million dollars to community organizations and efforts. In addition, our dedicated employees volunteer countless hours of their time to organizations and schools across the area. Our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees put safety and environmental compliance first. We are proud of their work and the Northwest Indiana community we call home.\"",
      "\"In addition to our spend on environmental compliance and community investment and engagement, we were the only U.S. Metals, Minerals and Mining company recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for 2025- the fourth consecutive year we received this designation. It is a testament to our commitment to ethical conduct and compliance.\"",
      "\"Gary Works was built in 1908, and the city was built around it. Any notion that we select certain areas to operate because of their demographics is wholly incorrect.\"",
      "On state and federal EPA fines, violations and consent decrees:",
      "\"U. S. Steel spends more than $80 million annually on environmental controls in Indiana as part of its commitment to environmental excellence. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, from which this data is drawn, includes manufacturing byproducts that are legally emitted under the EPA's stringent regulations and those which are legally disposed of in permitted landfills. As the nation's largest integrated steelmaking facility, it is common sense that U. S. Steel's Gary Works will have more legally allowed releases than smaller iron or steel mills in the country.\"",
      "Additional comment on emissions controls and other projects:",
      "\"U. S. Steel has robust systems and emissions control equipment at all levels of the steelmaking process to adhere to environmental regulations.",
      "At Gary Works, our processes and environmental controls are monitored extensively by our teams. Third parties are also used for sampling water and for opacity observation to ensure compliance with regulations.",
      "Our partnership with CarbonFree is one of the ways we're working to reduce emissions. This carbon capture and utilization project will help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions by converting emissions to calcium carbonate, which is used in a variety of products for consumers and industry.\u00a0 Gary Works also produces Pig Iron, an important feedstock for U. S. Steel's electric arc furnaces. The Company is on track to meet its goal of 20% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 goal and has a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\"",
      "IDEM is not a health agency nor a legislative body. IDEM is also not involved in local zoning decisions that determine where businesses are located.",
      "IDEM is responsible for implementing and enforcing existing federal and state environmental regulations. This includes issuing operating permits that ensure businesses comply with applicable environmental standards and conducting routine inspections to monitor compliance. When facilities are found to be out of compliance, IDEM can initiate enforcement actions or refer cases for further legal or administrative review.",
      "The U.S. EPA does require states to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) for areas in nonattainment within its borders. You can find more information on the SIPs for Lake and Porter counties here: https://www.in.gov/idem/sips/",
      "In 2013, IDEM conducted an assessment of air toxics in the industrialized area of Lake and Porter County. The complete Lakeshore Air Toxics Study is available here: https://www.in.gov/idem/toxic/studies/lakeshore-air-toxics-study. The study found air toxics concentrations and risk within the lakeshore area to be similar to comparable communities, and the most significant risk is attributable to mobile sources (motor vehicles). In the time since the study, technological advances and pollution prevention strategies have led to a further decline in industrial emissions.",
      "We recognize that air quality is a deeply important issue for Northwest Indiana residents and remain committed to our responsibilities under the Clean Air Act and other applicable laws. For more specific responses to questions involving federal enforcement actions, health data, or proposed changes to emission standards, we encourage you to follow up directly with the U.S. EPA.",
      "EPA is fulfilling its mission to protect human health and the environment. The agency works with our state partners to ensure industrial facilities comply with all environmental laws and regulations.",
      "EPA performs on-site and off-site inspections to ensure compliance. If noncompliance is found, EPA takes action. EPA has issued three recent Clean Air Act enforcement settlements, which have significantly reduced air emissions. In Burns Harbor, Cleveland Cliffs BOF steel making shop and Phoenix Global slag processing companies and in Gary, the U.S. Steel Gary Works' blast furnace have all decreased particulate matter and metal hazardous air pollutants to the atmosphere. Our state partner, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, also conducts inspections and enforcement actions.",
      "Previous compliance and enforcement work, including inspections and enforcement activity, can be found in EPA's ECHO system. You can search by location or by facility. Keep in mind that the integrated iron and steel mills that you reference may have contractors on site that have separate permits and emissions reporting.",

    "story": [
      "The National Institutes of Health is the world's largest source of funding for medical research. It has also undergone huge budget cuts in recent weeks imposed by the Trump administration, which prompts thoughts from Dr. Timothy Johnson, long-time ABC News medical editor and founding editor of the Harvard Medical School Health Letter:",
      "Over the course of my long career in medical journalism, I had the great privilege of getting to know many of the leading medical researchers in this country. They were typically people of great integrity who had dedicated themselves to the often-frustrating and tedious task of painstaking research to find new cures and preventions for important medical problems. And the bottom line for many of them was that, without government support, they could never have achieved the discoveries that have helped us all.",

    "summary": "Authorities in Hong Kong say COVID-19 levels are the worst in at least a year.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",
      "Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through emergency room visits and wastewater testing.",
      "\"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern,\" Thornburg said, citing a \"seasonality analysis\" that the agency has been working on about the virus.",

    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 22:09:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's why young workers with college degree are faring poorly in the labor market, according to a report.",
    "story": [
      "Recent college graduates are having a harder time finding work, despite their higher education degrees, which usually give job-seekers a leg up in the labor market.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Oxford Economics which shows that unemployed recent college grads account for 12% of an 85% rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. That's a high number, given that this cohort only makes up 5% of the total labor force.",
      "What's more, the rate of unemployment among workers who have recently graduated from college and are between the ages of 22 and 27, is nearing 6% \u2014which is above the national unemployment rate of 4.2%.",
      "\"People who have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher have a higher unemployment rate than national average, and this is the first time this has happened in the last 45 years of data,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That's noteworthy, he said, because \"those with higher educational attainment usually have better prospects overall than their peer with less.\"",
      "So why are recent college grads are having a tougher time finding work post-college than previous graduating classes did?",
      "While the report points to a couple of factors, it finds that a slowdown in hiring in formerly hot sectors is driving the growth in unemployment among degree holders.",
      "\"The rise in the recent graduate unemployment rate is largely part of a mismatch between an oversupply of recent graduates in fields where business demand has waned,\" according to the report.",
      "That holds especially true in the tech industry, as more college students graduate with degrees in computer science and related fields than any other major.",
      "\"Prospects for employment will remain minimal for these individuals, keeping the unemployment rate elevated in the near term,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in the report.",
      "Tech sector-centric",
      "Computer science is among the fastest-growing fields of study among undergrads, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, but jobs in the sector are particularly vulnerable to replacement by automation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence also expose workers in the field to being rendered obsolete.",
      "\"There's a mismatch between business demand and the labor supply overall,\" Martin said. \"And it's very concentrated in the technology sector.\"",
      "The industry hired at a fast clip when the economy reopened post-pandemic, before pulling back. Those cuts are likely still affecting the current unemployment rate, according to Martin.",
      "\"Some of it could be a normalization after the tech sector's hiring surge at the end of the pandemic around 2021,\" he said. \"But there's also evidence that AI is starting to impact lower-level computer science gigs,\" he added.",
      "Experienced workers who graduated with computer science degrees but have racked up more than a few years of experience are faring fine, noted Martin. It's those who do the kind of lower-level, rote work that AI is already adept at, who are seeing a mismatch between the number of jobs available and the supply of workers seeking them.",
      "\"Some of it might be businesses being productive with the workers they have and not wanting to increase costs overall by hiring. It could also be higher adoption rates of AI,\" Martin said. \"At the moment, it looks to be a bit of both.\"",
      "Uncertainty slows hiring",
      "Economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's aggressive, yet ever-changing tariff agenda, is also leading a number of businesses to press pause on growth and investment. Because of this, the unemployment rate among recent college graduates could continue to inch upward, according to Martin.",
      "\"We are heading into a period where uncertainty is really high; the impact of tariffs is starting to bleed through, and businesses are facing higher input costs,\" he said.",
      "Although recent college graduates who have secured employment aren't being laid off at higher rates than the rest of the workforce, Martin doesn't expect things to get easier for young graduates on the hunt for employment, absent a surge in hiring by tech companies or mass exodus of workers from the labor force.",
      "\"There is some softening in demand overall, but a lot of it is concentrated at the moment in recent college graduates, and we are looking for the unemployment rate to rise,\" he said.",
      "The \"underemployment\" effect",
      "When qualified workers with college degrees try and fail to find work in their desired field, they tend to continue seeking work, sometimes looking for a job in another sector, as opposed to withdrawing from the labor force, the report notes. That can lead to college-educated workers finding themselves \"underemployed,\" or in roles where 50% of the workers who occupy them do not have a bachelor's degree or higher.",
      "This scenario can doom them for years to come: Underemployed workers tend to remain so for the rest of their careers, according to a report.",

    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 19:30:19 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says he'll decide soon whether to take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public \u2014 a move that was vocally sought by Trump ally Bill Ackman.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump\u00a0said again Tuesday he's working to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president announced last week he was considering the move, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed Tuesday he is \"working on\" taking Fannie and Freddie public, but will continue overseeing the two enterprises even if their conservatorship ends. He also said the \"U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES\" to Fannie and Freddie, referring to the decades-old belief that the government would rescue Fannie and Freddie if needed, which likely keeps their borrowing costs low by making them appear safe to investors. It's unclear what form the \"guarantee\" could take in the future.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's decision to delay a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union led to a Wall Street rally on Tuesday, with the major indexes closing higher.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 119 points, or 2.1%, to close at 5,922 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 741 points, or 1.8%, to close at 42,344. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5%.",
      "Mr. Trump had initially threatened to impose a \"straight 50% Tariff\" on the trading bloc, effective June 1. The news, announced by the president in a Truth Social post Friday, sent stocks tumbling as investors braced for more uncertainty.",
      "But investors viewed the markets with more enthusiasm on Tuesday following an announcement from Mr. Trump over the holiday weekend that he would\u00a0delay the implementation of EU tariffs, from June 1 to July 9.",
      "Analysts noted that the stop-and-go nature of the president's tariff policies have been a key driver of market volatility in recent weeks, with stock movements hinging upon news of potential trade deals. All the while, experts say that the president's moves could be part of his overall strategy to broker new deals.",
      "\"With the Europe tariff threat removed, at least for now, markets got more evidence that tariffs are largely a negotiation tool,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The administration has been working to strike trade agreements before July 9, when the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs\u00a0is set to end. The president announced broad terms of a trade deal with\u00a0with the United Kingdom earlier this month, followed by a tariff truce with China.",
      "Maros Sefcovic, chief trade negotiator for the EU, said Monday, following calls with top U.S. officials, that the bloc was \"fully committed\" to reaching an agreement with the U.S. by the July deadline.",
      "European stocks were also up amid news of the U.S.-EU trade talk progress, while Asian indexes were mixed.",
      "Rise in consumer sentiment",
      "A partial rebound in consumer confidence added to Tuesday's positivity. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, released Tuesday morning, found consumer confidence rose 12.3 points to reach 98.0, up from 85.7 in April. The upswing follows month of decline in the index, triggered by fears of inflation and tariff-induced economic uncertainty. Analysts, however, warned the positive turnaround may be short-lived.",
      "\"Consumer confidence in May rebounded after trade tensions eased, but this may only be temporary,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in a research note.",
      "The bond market remained steady after easing slightly on Friday, after concerns earlier in the week over the nation's debt led to an uptick in Treasury Yields. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury were at 4.5% as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Still, this moment of calm may also be temporary, some economists say. In a research note on Tuesday, UBS analysts said investors should brace for more volatility in the bond market, as Mr. Trump's budget bill still\u00a0awaits approval from the Senate.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla sales across Europe plummeted by almost 50% last month even as the broader market for electric cars saw growth in the region, according to data released Tuesday.",
      "Sales of Tesla vehicles in 32 European countries tumbled 49% to 7,261 in April from 14,228 in the same month the previous year, according to the figures released by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA.",
      "At the same time, sales of battery-electric vehicles by all manufacturers rose about 28%, the group's data shows.",
      "The numbers are the latest indication of how much the Tesla brand is suffering because of the backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk over his far-right views. Crowds have gathered at Tesla dealerships in both Europe and the U.S., with protesters objecting to Musk's work with President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed the U.S. federal workforce and been the subject of multiple lawsuits.",
      "The protesters are aiming at Tesla to dent Musk's fortunes, given that much of his wealth is tied up in shares of the electric vehicle maker.",
      "\"2025 started off as a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla as Elon's role in the Trump Administration and DOGE created a life of its own which created brand damage and a black cloud over the story,\" noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a May 23 research note.",
      "Musk, meanwhile, said last month he would scale back his DOGE work beginning in May in order to spend more time at Tesla. The EV company's first-quarter earnings fell far short of analyst expectations, with revenue tumbling 9% and profit slumping 71%.",
      "The latest European sales figures, which cover the European Union's 27 member countries and five other nations outside the bloc, back up early data from Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark released at the start of this month that had pointed to a sales collapse.",
      "Tesla's aging model lineup",
      "While Tesla has been reeling from protests and boycotts over Musk wading into politics, it also faces other factors including an aging model lineup and intensifying competition from rival electric vehicle brands, particularly from China.",
      "Mr. Trump's trade war has also turned Europeans off buying American brands. In recent days, Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods, accusing the bloc of being \"very difficult to deal with,\" before agreeing to delay the duties until July.",
      "In one sign that Tesla appears to be losing ground to cut-price Chinese brands, sales at China's SAIC zoomed up 54% in April, according to the ACEA figures. SAIC owns a slew of auto brands including U.K.-based MG, known for its low-cost EV models.",
      "Tesla is also suffering because it had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply.",
      "For the first four months of the year, Tesla's European sales fell roughly 39% to 61,320 while the continent's auto market as a while showed little change during the same period, according to the data.",
      "For April, car sales in the EU edged up 1.3% from the previous year, \"showing signs of recovery despite the ongoing unpredictable global economic environment,\" the group said in a press release. Meanwhile, sales of gasoline and diesel powered cars slumped.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-rate-funtionally-unemployed-economy/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 08:36:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Many workers aren't working as much as they'd like. Here's what one expert says the federal unemployment rate fails to capture.",
    "story": [
      "While the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, another measure of worker well-being indicates there may be bigger cracks in the labor market.",
      "The low unemployment rate, which stood at 4.2% in April, has signaled to economists and investors alike that the U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Employers are also continuing to hire despite headwinds like tariffs and plunging consumer confidence.",
      "But another indicator suggests those pieces of government data may be painting an overly rosy picture of the economy, with a recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finding the \"true rate\" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, up slightly from 24% in March, while the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate remained unchanged at 4.2% over the same period.",
      "LISEP's measure encompasses not only unemployed workers, but also people who are looking for work but can't find full-time employment, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. By tracking functionally unemployed workers, the measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion.",
      "\"The unemployment data, as it's put out, has some flaws,\" LISEP chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"For example, it counts you as employed if you've worked as little as one hour over the prior two weeks. So you can be homeless and in a tent community and have worked one hour and be counted, irrespective of how poorly-paid that hour may be.\"",
      "LISEP, in a working paper on the gauge, says the measure prevents part-time jobs or poorly paid work from being counted as equal to full-time and better-paid work. LISEP also argues that the unemployment rate \"presents a very incomplete and, in many ways, misleading picture.\"",
      "In other words, people who lack steady work and don't earn living wages shouldn't be counted as functionally employed. Its True Rate of Unemployment (TRU), which began tracking the measure in 2020, encapsulates workers whose earnings don't allow them to make ends meet, and are struggling just to get by, according to LISEP.",
      "\"If you're part time and can't get a full-time job, then we count you as functionally unemployed,\" Ludwig noted. \"We also count as functionally unemployed people who don't earn above a poverty wage.\"",
      "\"Survival mode\"",
      "In so doing, it counts workers who can't afford to put roofs over their heads, can't procure nutritious meals and don't have the ability to save as being functionally unemployed.",
      "\"You don't have anything that gets you to the first rung of the American dream ladder. You're in survival mode,\" Ludwig said.",
      "When broken down by race and gender, TRU shows Hispanic, Black and women workers faring worse than White workers, as well as men.",
      "More than 28% of Hispanic workers, and nearly 27% of Black workers are functionally unemployed, compared to 23% of White workers. And more female workers \u2014 28.6% \u2014 are functionally unemployed than male workers, whose true rate of unemployment stands at 20%, according to LISEP.",
      "Millions of households are currently struggling to maintain a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to another recent analysis from LISEP.",
      "Its research found that the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living. These households earned an average of $38,000 per year in 2023, but would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "The wide chasm between the the BLS's measure of unemployment and its true rate of unemployment is also concerning, according to Ludwig.",
      "\"If you say there's 4.2% unemployment, which makes political folks happy because it's a low number, it causes all kinds of poor policy decisions and assumes we are better off than we are,\" Ludwig said. \"There's less energy and less of a push to improve employment, and the people who get hurt are middle- and low-income Americans.\"",

      "Situated on opposite sides of the St. Marys River, the U.S. and Canadian counterparts are connected by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, over which thousands of vehicles pass each month.",
      "\"It's so intertwined,\" said Linda Hoath, executive director of the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau, who noted that many people have family members on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. \"There's no separation between the two communities,\" she said.",
      "But with the U.S. trade war unleashed against Canada\u00a0in recent months\u00a0\u2014 along with reports of detentions of travelers at the Canadian border by U.S. immigration authorities and threats of annexation by\u00a0President Trump, the chasm between the two neighbors has grown, as fewer Canadians make the trip south to the United States.",
      "According to Sault Ste. Marie's International Bridge Administration, the passenger car traffic in April was down 44% compared with last year. And while the waning bridge traffic may not mean much from the view of Canada's second-largest province and most popular\u00a0destination, to the historic Michigan town it certainly does.",
      "\"They have 70,000 people,\" Hoath said. \"And if they're not coming over and buying in our stores, then it affects us much more.\"",
      "Slowdown in travel to the U.S.",
      "Sault Ste. Marie is not alone in its tourism concerns. Though travel this Memorial Day weekend is expected to be the highest on record, one group has been noticeably absent at U.S. travel checkpoints in recent months: international travelers.",
      "International travel to the U.S.\u00a0fell 14% in March\u00a0compared with the same period last year, according to the the U.S. Travel Association. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest dip in travel, 20.2%, was from Canada, according to research from Tourism Economics, a unit of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Trudeau urged Canadians to\u00a0refrain from vacationing in the U.S., after Mr. Trump slapped a 25% tariff\u00a0on Canadian goods. The drop-off in Canadian travel is a notable shift, given that Canada was the biggest source of inbound travel to the U.S. last year, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "As to what's behind the overall slowdown in international travel to the U.S., experts point to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, the strength of the U.S. dollar and long visa wait times. Aggressive tariff policies have also left a bad taste in many travelers' mouths.",
      "\"Shifting sentiment and perceptions of the U.S. are expected to continue to weigh heavily on travel demand,\" said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics.",
      "As of April, flight bookings to the U.S. for the May\u2013July travel window are 10.8% lower than they were the same period last year, according to the research firm. It projects an 8.7% decline in international arrivals in 2025.",
      "Economic Impact",
      "The slowdown in international travel threatens to destabilize America's tourism industry which plays a vital role in supporting the nation's economy.",
      "\"International inbound travel is hugely important from an economic standpoint \u2014 people that come to the U.S. and visit spend on average $4,000 per visit,\" a spokesperson from the U.S. Travel Association, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those dollars may already be slipping away: The World Travel & Tourism Council projects that spending by international visitors to the U.S. will drop to $169 billion, or 7%, this year, from $181 billion in 2024. That's a 22.5% decrease from peak tourist spending of $217 billion in 2019, before the pandemic.",
      "Fewer international travelers could also take a toll on the workforce that props up America's tourism industry: Nearly 10% of American jobs are tied to the travel industry, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "An ongoing decline in international travel to the U.S. could result in a loss of over 230,000 jobs \u2014 with the dining and lodging industries expected to be the most hard hit, according to a recent analysis from the economic research firm IMPLAN.",
      "\"It's not going to devastate the U.S. economy in terms of GDP, but it is very significant in terms of employment,\" Jenny Thorvaldson, IMPLAN's chief economist and data officer, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hoath, who runs the visitor center in Sault Ste. Marie, said she is already worried about what those losses could mean for her community.",
      "\"When we're looking at the bridge and it's packed, people have to get their employees together,\" she said. \"But if it's not so busy, what happens to your employees? They're not making the money. Some people will be laid off.\"",
      "Hotel bookings in the city of 14,000 are already down 77% year to date, according to the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau.",
      "Shifting focus to domestic travelers",
      "As international tourism dampens, local communities like Flagstaff, Arizona, are rerouting their attention to domestic travelers.",
      "Despite the city's wide international appeal, the travel season has gotten off to a slow start. Flagstaff has seen a 15% to 20% drop in international tourists year over year, according to Trace Ward, director of Flagstaff's Convention and Visitors Bureau.",
      "While he hopes that decline will only be temporary, Ward is looking for ways to bring in more American tourists. One strategy he has in mind is adding more direct flights to the area and possibly attracting a new airline. The city is also promoting its\u00a0Lowell Observatory's new Astronomy Discovery Center, which offers visitors a glimpse of the cosmos.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 May 2025 09:53:33 -0400",
    "summary": "What began as the world's first aerial crop-dusting operation in the Mississippi Delta in 1925 has survived mergers, recessions and bankruptcy to become a global carrier with 5,000 flights a day.",
    "story": [
      "When you picture a garage sale, you might think of your neighbor's driveway down the street, not an aviation workshop in the shadow of the world's busiest airport, where Delta Air Lines holds their monthly surplus sale.",
      "Delta fans came from as far as Michigan and even Korea to buy the stuff the airline no longer needs, from seats to engine parts. It's a chance, these folks say, to own a piece of airline history. And how would they get the stuff home? \"We actually flew down with empty bags,\" said one man.",
      "Sarah Zeis came in search of a particular piece of Delta history: a well-used beverage cart. \"I actually need a bar cart in my apartment of these exact dimensions,\" she said.",
      "Getting it home will be a journey all its own.",
      "Proceeds from the sale go right across the parking lot, to the Delta Flight Museum, now celebrating the airline's 100th year \u2013 a first for an American carrier.",
      "It's a century of service that started without beverage carts \u2026 or passengers!",
      "According to archives director Marie Force, Delta owes its existence to a tiny pest: the boll weevil. \"It is the most unique beginning of a U.S. airline, I think,\" she said. \"It's the only airline that started as a crop-dusting company\"",
      "Before Delta, there was Huff-Daland Dusters, started in 1925 in Macon, Georgia. Force said, \"After the first growing season, they realized that most of the center of the business was in the Mississippi Delta region. And so, that's where the name Delta comes from.\"",
      "And in 1929, Delta Air Lines' founder C.E. Woolman expanded the company from pest control to people. Its first passenger flight was from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with two stops in Louisiana along the way. A ticket cost $90 round trip \u2013 about $1,700 today. Expensive, and not for everyone. Force said, \"At that time, about 80% of Delta's passengers were businessmen\" \u2013 people trying to speed up a trip that took 12 hours by train to a five-hour flight.",
      "Nearly a century after that first flight, Delta now has more than 5,000 flights a day. The airline has survived mergers, recessions, and bankruptcy, growing from that single route to a nationwide carrier, and the global force we know today.",
      "\"Glamour personified\"",
      "If you've flown Delta lately, you've seen flight attendant Susan Slater in the pre-flight safety video. If you've flown Delta in the last 60 years, you may have shared a cabin with either Slater (who started with the airline on March 2, 1964) or Kay Carpenter (who started in January 1966). It was the \"Golden Age\" of air travel, that romanticized era of flights with exceptional service, extravagant meals, and everyone dressed to the nines.",
      "Back then, said Slater, \"You had to be unmarried. Your hair couldn't touch your collar. You had a weight restriction. Back then I think I weighed 103 pounds and I was 5 foot 2-and-a-half. I'm five feet now, barely, and not 103!\"",
      "I asked, \"What was it about the job that you think spoke to you so much?\"",
      "\"All I knew was that this was glamour personified,\" Slater replied.",
      "Atmosphere Research Group's Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, says there is no need to be so quite so nostalgic: \"We certainly had a so-called Golden Age of flying back in the early 1960s,\" he said. \"But it was less convenient. There were fewer flights. You often had to connect. And it certainly wasn't as reliable and safe as it is today.",
      "\"We're in the new type of Golden Age now, where flying is a lot more accessible,\" he said. \"You can either buy or create a much nice journey for yourself. You can buy an extra leg room seat. You can pay for priority boarding. And by the way, if you don't need or value those things or perhaps can't afford it, you're not being charged for services that you don't want.\"",
      "Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, said, \"Air travel is one of the great bargains. If you think about the average fare today versus where it was 30, 40 years ago, it's less than half of what you pay in real dollars.\"",
      "While low fares are sought after by some fliers, Delta has built its business around a premium experience, according to Bastian: \"The single biggest reason why people chose an airline was fare; whoever had the lowest cost won. And Delta, well, yes, we have a product to compete on the lower end. [But] the majority of our revenue comes from higher-end tickets.\"",
      "Their 100th summer is about to take flight, amid clouds of uncertainty \u2026 worries about a slowing economy and aviation safety. But Bastian says it could still be their busiest ever, as he looks to the future.",
      "So, what does he see for Delta's next hundred years? \"When you think in the United States, you know, air travel is relatively ubiquitous \u2013 you jump on a plane almost any hour of the day and get to almost anywhere you want, you know, pretty, pretty easily,\" Bastian said. \"However, when you think about the world, and you realize that only one in five people in the world has even been on an airplane, it's pretty remarkable. We need to figure out ways to make it accessible, to make it affordable, to make it sustainable.\"",
      "I said, \"Part of that legacy is just how much the world has shrunk in those 100 years.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's what we do,\" Bastian said. \"We make the world a more connected place, a smaller place. And that's needed now more than ever.\"",
      "While Delta helped shrink the world in the 20th century, they hope their own growth continues, thanks to folks like Susan Slater and Kay Carpenter.",
      "\"It's been a wonderful adventure,\" Carpenter said. \"I never dreamed that I would be here for this long. When I started, we had just small airplanes. We flew to small cities. And now we fly to six continents. So, I tell all these new hire flight attendants to always remember that one mile on a highway is going to take you exactly one mile. But a mile on a runway will take you anywhere.\"",

    "summary": "The Publix supermarket chain is recalling fruit and vegetable baby food because testing found elevated levels of lead.",
    "story": [
      "The supermarket chain Publix has recalled fruit and vegetable baby food sold in eight states because product testing found elevated levels of lead, according to federal health officials.",
      "Publix recalled 4-ounce Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches sold at more than 1,400 stores.",
      "The pouches were produced by Bowman Andros, a French company with a manufacturing plant in Mount Jackson, Virginia, according to the company's website. Publix issued the voluntary recall on May 9, but it wasn't added to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall list until late Thursday.",
      "The potential contamination was flagged by officials in North Carolina, the state that first identified a 2023 lead poisoning outbreak linked to tainted applesauce pouches that sickened more than 500 U.S. children.",
      "Routine sampling of the baby food pouches found lead levels at 13.4 parts per billion, according to North Carolina agriculture officials. That exceeds the FDA's recommended limit of 10 parts per billion for such products intended for babies and young children.",
      "Publix said all the potentially contaminated products have been removed from store shelves. No illnesses have been reported, the company said. Customers can return the pouches to local stores for full refund.",
      "This is the second baby food pouch recall because of potential lead contamination in two months. In March, Target recalled more than 25,000 packages of its store brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree because of elevated lead levels.",
      "North Carolina collaborates with the FDA to conduct routine testing of food products, officials said.",
      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. Those findings led to the detection of a nationwide outbreak linked to the pouches, which were widely sold in Dollar Tree and other stores. Tests showed they contained lead at levels 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum recommended level, as well as chromium.",
      "Federal health officials eventually identified 566 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected cases of lead poisoning tied to the pouches in 44 states.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's childhood lead poisoning program investigated the applesauce outbreak and coordinated the state and federal response. However, the program was eliminated in April as part of federal funding cuts under the Trump administration.",
      "CDC officials didn't say whether or how the agency would respond to a similar outbreak now. A spokesperson said the agency is aware of the Publix baby food recall but hasn't been asked to assist with any investigation.",
      "There is no safe level of lead exposure, according to the CDC. While the heavy metal is toxic to people of all ages, it can be especially harmful to children, causing damage to the brain and nervous system and slow growth and development.",
      "Heavy metals like lead can get into food products from soil, air, water or industrial processes, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

      "\"Just when markets believed the worst of the tariff battle had been overcome, President Trump threatened a 50% tariff against the EU this week, starting on 1 June, and a possible 25% tariff on iPhones produced abroad. This could all be a negotiating tactic, but the uncertainty caused by this back-and-forth is not good for global growth or markets,\" Klaus Baader, an analyst with SG Securities, told investors in a report.",
      "Mr. Trump said that he would impose a 25% tariff on Apple if the company did not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S., a \"frustrating situation for investors\" said Daniel Ives, a tech analyst from Wedbush Securities in a Friday research note. Apple's stock had fallen 3% by market close.",

    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data. Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

      "Boeing will be required to invest that money in improving the aviation giant's compliance, safety and quality program, while $445 million will be set aside to provide compensation for the families of the victims killed in the crashes, the Justice Department said.",
      "The agreement stems from the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019.

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The massive budget bill passed by the House includes new tax breaks for tipped workers and those who get overtime.",
    "story": [
      "The massive Republican-backed budget bill \u2014 called \"one big, beautiful bill\" by President Trump \u2014 includes several new tax rules that could have a big financial impact on millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay.",
      "While the heart of the bill is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, the legislation also includes several provisions that were part of the president's campaign last year, such as his vow to eliminate taxes on tipped income.",
      "The bill could deliver savings of about $1,700 for each tipped worker as well as employees who earn overtime, the House Ways and Means Committee said on May 20. But there are some restrictions in the bill that could limit the financial boon for these workers, with some policy experts saying that the tax breaks may not be as useful as they first appear.",
      "For instance, almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax, according to the Brookings Institution. Consequently, the tax break is likely to provide a bigger helping hand to higher-paid tipped workers, while leaving some low-income workers behind.",
      "\"If your goal is to help the poorest service workers, this is probably not the way to do it,\" said Michael Lynn, a professor of services marketing at Cornell University whose research largely focuses on tipping and other consumer behavior.",
      "The 1,100-page bill, which squeaked through the House on Thursday by a single vote, will now go to the Senate, where more changes are likely. Here's what to know about the provisions as they now stand.",
      "How would the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision work?",
      "Called the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision within the House bill, the rule would create a new tax deduction that eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people who work in jobs that have traditionally received them.",
      "There are about 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, or about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The tax break includes some restrictions:",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.\u00a0Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.\u00a0The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.",
      "Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.",
      "Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.",
      "The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.",
      "The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "\"The tip exemption will significantly increase take-home pay for most tipped workers, many of whom are low- to middle-income taxpayers,\" the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), a group that advises the president on economic issues, said in a report published earlier this month.",
      "The CEA's report estimates that the average take-home pay for tipped workers would increase by $1,675 per year under the provision.",
      "Would it help all tipped workers?",
      "No, because 4 in 10 tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income taxes, which means they wouldn't see any benefit. There's also a concern that some employers could reclassify some workers as tipped workers by arguing they would receive a tax break, according to Brookings.",
      "The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, versus $7.25 an hour for non-tipped workers.",
      "One Fair Wage, an advocacy group representing service workers, criticized the measure, noting that the GOP bill also includes cuts to social safety net programs that many tipped workers rely on. \"It also slashes Medicaid, putting 1.2 million restaurant workers at risk of losing health care,\" One Fair Wage posted on social media.",
      "What about the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act?",
      "A separate, standalone bill called the No Tax on Tips Act, which is solely focused on giving a tax break to tipped workers, was passed by the Senate on May 20, with bipartisan support. That bill will now move to the House for a vote.",
      "The Senate bill offers similar benefits and restrictions as the \"one big, beautiful bill\" when it comes to taxes and tips, but with one major difference: The bigger GOP bill requires workers, as well as their spouses, to have a Social Security number.",
      "That requirement appears to be aimed at excluding some immigrants from tapping the tax break, while the Senate bill doesn't stipulate that taxpayers who claim this break, or their spouses, must have a Social Security number.",
      "Senator Jackie Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, urged lawmakers to pass the Not Tax on Tips Act arguing in a statement that the bigger GOP bill combines the tax break with cuts to vital programs like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\"We shouldn't be forcing working families to choose between keeping their health care or keeping their tips, which is why we want this bipartisan bill on its own \u2014 on its own \u2014 not part of a harmful, extreme budget bill,\" Rosen said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.",
      "How does the \"No Tax on Overtime\" provision work?",
      "The GOP bill includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime, another one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises.",
      "About 8% of hourly workers and 4% of salaried workers receive overtime pay on a regular basis, according to the Yale Budget Lab. About 70% of salaried workers don't qualify for overtime pay, it noted.",
      "The legislation would enable workers to claim a deduction on their taxes for the amount they earned in overtime pay during the tax year, although there are some restrictions:",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.",
      "The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "But more guidelines about the provision would still need to be determined by the Treasury Department, according to tax firm Wolters Kluwer in a May 22 publication about the tax bill.",
      "The average overtime worker would see a tax cut between $1,400 to $1,750 per year through the new break, according to the Council of Economic Advisers.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda in order to win over opposing factions in the GOP. And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

      "President Trump threatened to impose a fresh round of tariffs Friday morning, including a 25% tariff on Apple if they do not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S.",
      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing.

      "The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.",
      "The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.",
      "Two of the states \u2014 Utah and Illinois \u2014 have \"trigger\" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.",
      "The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.",

      "\"We need to stand our ground,\" he said. \"California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.",
      "\"Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom said.",
      "In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.",
      "Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.",
      "Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.",
      "\"We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,\" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.",
      "Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.",
      "Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.",
      "\"There are no great alternatives, politically,\" he said. \"It's a prisoner's dilemma \u2014 a move in either direction does not make much sense.\"",
      "Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.",
      "Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.",
      "\"This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,\" Slonaker said.",
      "In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. \"It would be a hard situation, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.",
      "She said the provision shows Republicans' \"hostility against immigrants\" and that \"they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as \"an open doormat,\" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.",
      "A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, contributing to the national uninsured rate dropping to historic lows.",
      "The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.",
      "In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.",
      "By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.",
      "The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.",
      "Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to \"support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.\"",
      "Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a \"red herring\" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.",
      "The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.",
      "The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.",
      "The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.",

      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "summary": "Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who's led the department since the Capitol riot, spoke with CBS News before his retirement.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who took charge of the department in the difficult months after the U.S. Capitol siege, is retiring from his position Friday. After the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, he helped rebuild the department's shrunken staff, beefed up recruitment efforts and bolstered the agency's intelligence operations and communications to fix weaknesses revealed by the breach of the Capitol.",
      "Manger told CBS News he faced stiff challenges when he arrived on the job in 2021.",
      "\"The department as a whole had lost confidence in the (prior) leadership as a result of what happened,\" he said. \"And there were big things that were identified as things that needed to be fixed as quickly as we could fix them: Things like the intelligence failures, the communication failures, the equipment failures, the training failures, the leadership failures \u2014 all of those things needed to be addressed immediately.\"",
      "Manger, a former local police chief in Fairfax County, Virginia, and Montgomery County, Maryland, successfully advocated for increases in funding to improve hiring, equipment and operations.",
      "The department was blasted by critics for intelligence failures that contributed to the violation of the complex on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"We now have a world class intelligence operation. We are significant players in the intelligence community in the Washington, D.C., region and, frankly, all over the country,\" Manger said. \"Whereas before, we were basically just \u2014... we were consumers of information. The FBI would give us intelligence, other agencies would give us intelligence. Now we are gathering our own.\"",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police Board will select a new police chief, which Manger predicts will happen soon.",
      "Manger has requested nearly $1 billion in funding for 2026, which would represent the latest in a series of recent budget boosts for the department. In testimony before a congressional committee on justifying his budget request, Manger cited an elevated number of investigations into threats against members of Congress.",
      "\"The current climate of threats has reached alarming levels,\" he told the committee in April. Capitol Police records show the number of threats launched against congressional members in 2024 exceeded 9,400.",
      "He added, \"Social media and the internet provide a breeding ground for threats that \u2014 regardless of their nature \u2014 the department must investigate.\"",
      "Manger and the Capitol Police have also bolstered the department's operations outside of Washington, responding to potential threats in the hometowns of lawmakers.",
      "The department has a unique mission among police agencies, protecting elected leaders and securing the U.S. Capitol campus, which hosts over 3 million visitors each year. The Capitol is open to the public, and lawmakers are accessible to citizens.",
      "Manger has been critical of the pardons issued by President Trump to free Capitol rioters who beat, clubbed and gassed Capitol Police and other officers during the attack on the Capitol. He told CBS News that when Mr. Trump issued 1,500 pardons to the suspected and convicted rioters when he took office, it \"was probably one of my worst days in this job.\"",
      "He also blasted conspiracy theories about Jan. 6 that continue to circulate on social media.",
      "\"My folks were here on Jan. 6. They were part of what went on. They were assaulted,\" Manger said. \"They were in fights. Many of them were injured. They know exactly what happened on Jan. 6. For somebody to make up some story that, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad,' \u2014 it is just not true.\"",
      "\"What a chilling message to law enforcement, because we've got a job to do, and we don't care what the issue is,\" Manger continued. \"We don't care what side of the coin you're on on any particular issue because we have a job to do, to maintain public order and to keep the peace.\"",
      "Rep. Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, said of Manger, \"Since taking over at the department's hour of greatest need, he professionalized a force in need of steady leadership.\"",
      "A union representative for Capitol Police officers told CBS News, \"Manpower is still an issue, as well as balancing work and family life for the rank and file officers, which continues to plague morale within the agency.\"",
      "As he prepares to leave the department, Manger was lauded by one of the former Capitol Police officers who responded to the Jan. 6 riot. Former officer Harry Dunn told CBS News, \"He showed his love for country, his love for law enforcement and his continued dedication to public service.\"",
      "Scott MacFarlane is CBS News' Justice correspondent. He has covered Washington for two decades, earning 20 Emmy and Edward R. Murrow awards. His reporting has resulted directly in the passage of five new laws."

      "The State Department has ordered U.S. embassies to temporarily stop scheduling new student visa appointments, as the Trump administration works to expand social media screenings for applicants, the latest in a series of restrictions on international students.",
      "In a cable dated Tuesday and obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts not to add any more appointments for student and foreign exchange visas in preparation for the expanded vetting, and to take any unfilled appointments off their calendars. If students have already scheduled their visa interviews, those can still go forward.",
      "The pause will last \"until further guidance is issued\" in the next few days.",
      "The State Department is preparing for an \"expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" and all student visa applicants could be subject to social media checks, according to the cable. This extra screening would have \"significant implications\" for embassies and consulates' operations, making a pause on new appointments necessary, the cable said.",
      "A senior State Department official confirmed the cable's accuracy to CBS News.",
      "The memo was first reported by Politico.",
      "When asked about student visas, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday, \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.\"",
      "International students who want to study in the U.S. are typically required to schedule interviews at an American embassy or consulate, usually in their home country, as part of the visa application process. Wait times vary widely: At most embassies, appointments for student visa interviews can be scheduled less than two months in advance, though some diplomatic posts have longer waits.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would screen some visa applicants, including people seeking student visas, for what it called \"antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals.\"",
      "The screenings are part of a wider slate of controls aimed at international students \u2014 some of which have run into pushback from the court system.",
      "Last week, DHS told Harvard University it can no longer enroll international students, escalating a monthslong battle between the administration and the Ivy League school. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration is \"holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\" but Harvard said the move was illegal. A judge quickly blocked the policy.",
      "The government has sought to deport a handful of students based on their pro-Palestinian activism \u2014 some of whom have green cards, including Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 citing a law that allows visas to be revoked if somebody poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Lawyers argue these visa revocations violate students' First Amendment rights, though the government says it has the right to do so. Some students, including Mahdawi, have been released on bail.",
      "And lawyers say the Trump administration has tried to end legal status for thousands of other international students, many of whom appeared to be targeted over minor legal infractions. A federal judge has blocked that effort.",

      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk's comments appear to put him at odds with Mr. Trump, who has championed the massive spending package.

      "Former Culpeper County Sheriff Jenkins, 53, was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in March. But on Monday, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Jenkins and his family \"have been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ.\"",
      "\"This Sheriff is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn't deserve to spend a single day in jail. He is a wonderful person, who was persecuted by the Radical Left \"monsters,\" and \"left for dead,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Jenkins' attorneys for comment.",
      "Jenkins was indicted in 2023 on 16 counts. In December, a jury found Jenkins guilty of one count of conspiracy, four counts of honest services fraud and seven counts of bribery. Jenkins appealed his conviction in April.",
      "Federal prosecutors say Jenkins took $75,000 worth of bribes. He allegedly accepted cash and campaign contributions from eight people \u2014 including two undercover FBI agents \u2014 and in return, gave them badges and made them auxiliary deputy sheriffs, despite not having any training or vetting. He also allegedly pushed officials to restore one bribe-payer's right to possess a gun as a convicted felon.",
      "Jenkins took the stand in his own defense and said there was no connection between the payments he received and the badges he handed out, according to news reports.

    "summary": "Kennedy's move appears to shortcut the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, dropping COVID vaccines from the list recommended for children and pregnant women.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated for COVID-19.",
      "\"I couldn't be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule,\" Kennedy said in a video attached to his post.",
      "However, as of Tuesday morning, the CDC had so far not updated the immunization schedule to reflect the removal announced by Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's move, announced Tuesday on X, appears to effectively shortcut a process set up by the agency's outside advisers to discuss and make changes to the CDC's influential vaccination guidance, which is directly tied to what insurers are required to cover and liability protections.",
      "Those advisers had already been weighing whether and how to narrow the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and other people with an underlying condition that put them at risk of more severe illness from COVID-19.",
      "Kennedy's announcement also goes further than the advisory panel, which had been weighing including pregnant women as among those who would remain eligible for COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, given their increased risk of severe disease and the fact that it could also help provide some protection to their newborns.",
      "It is not clear why Kennedy chose to announce the decision without waiting for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to complete its deliberations. The panel had been expected to vote on the issue at the routinely scheduled June meeting hosted by the agency.",
      "\"With the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, it is time to move forward. HHS and the CDC remain committed to gold standard science and to ensuring the health and well-being of all Americans \u2014 especially our nation's children \u2014 using common sense,\" Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email.",
      "Kennedy has also stalled other overdue recommendations from the panel for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccines and meningococcal vaccines.",
      "The committee had voted on updated recommendations for those vaccines in April. Usually it is up to the CDC director to approve the recommendations. But it has been up to Kennedy to decide whether to adopt the new guidance, since the Trump administration has not appointed an acting CDC director to replace Susan Monarez, who stepped aside from that role while she goes through the nomination process for CDC director.",
      "Only one recommendation from the April meeting, an update to restrict use of a Chikungunya vaccine linked to potentially severe side effects, has been greenlighted by Kennedy.",
      "HHS has not responded to requests for comment on why the other recommendations have been delayed.",
      "Can you still get a COVID vaccination for your children or if you're pregnant?",
      "While COVID-19 vaccines still remain available for now, experts say that access to the shots for children and during pregnancy could get harder once Kennedy's changes are official.",
      "The CDC's immunization guidance is closely watched by health experts because it serves as the basis for\u00a0legal requirements for which vaccines health insurance plans are required to cover with no cost-sharing.",
      "Removing the CDC's recommendations for children and pregnant women to be routinely vaccinated could mean those patients might have to start paying out of pocket for some or all of the cost of COVID-19 shots.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations also govern access to the shots through the federal Vaccines for Children program, which provides COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured children. Guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, requiring coverage of vaccinations to children and during pregnancy, is also tied to the CDC's recommendations.",
      "According to the CDC's price lists, the private sector price tag for COVID-19 vaccines starts at $57.50 per dose in children and $136.75 in adults.",
      "Another way that removing the recommendation could narrow availability of the shots is through the liability protections that Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response issued during the COVID-19 pandemic, expanding access to the shots for children in places like pharmacies.",
      "Spokespeople for CDC, ASPR and CMS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"That would essentially close the door to pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant women at pharmacies. And as we know, throughout the pandemic and over the last few years, the pharmacy has been the primary location where many have been receiving their vaccines,\" said Richard Dang, assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.",
      "Dang represents the American Pharmacists Association on the COVID-19 work group to CDC's vaccine advisers. He previously led the city COVID-19 vaccination program in Los Angeles.",
      "While Dang said there are other pathways for states to enable pharmacists to continue giving COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant patients, he warned those were challenging to implement and unlikely to resolve issues with insurance coverage of the shots caused by the change.",
      "\"Even if a pharmacy were allowed to administer vaccine off-label through a protocol or collaborative practice agreement, the individual patient would likely have to pay cash for it,\" Dang said.",
      "Why were COVID-19 vaccines recommended during pregnancy?",
      "The move also puts Kennedy at odds with his new officials at the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration, who\u00a0recently said\u00a0pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals.",
      "\"This one preventive strategy that is cost-effective, that can be readily available when the ACIP provides a universal recommendation, limits barriers to access. It is a really important mechanism to protect our moms and babies,\" said Dr. Naima Joseph, assistant professor at Boston University.",
      "Like Dang, Joseph is also a member of the COVID-19 work group to the CDC's vaccine advisers. Joseph represents the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",
      "A statement released by the OB-GYN organization Tuesday voiced frustration with Kennedy's move, warning that COVID infections during pregnancy \"can be catastrophic\" for families and that \"the science has not changed.\"",
      "Joseph said data still shows that pregnant people have an increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized. She also said newborns have no other way to get protection from the virus, outside of the mother's vaccination.",
      "\"Infants are the second leading group of our population being hospitalized. And when we look into those risks, it's really that they're born to moms who haven't received an updated COVID-19 vaccine,\" said Joseph.",

    "summary": "President Trump says he'll decide soon whether to take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public \u2014 a move that was vocally sought by Trump ally Bill Ackman.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump\u00a0said again Tuesday he's working to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president announced last week he was considering the move, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed Tuesday he is \"working on\" taking Fannie and Freddie public, but will continue overseeing the two enterprises even if their conservatorship ends. He also said the \"U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES\" to Fannie and Freddie, referring to the decades-old belief that the government would rescue Fannie and Freddie if needed, which likely keeps their borrowing costs low by making them appear safe to investors. It's unclear what form the \"guarantee\" could take in the future.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "summary": "A lawyer told CBS News he discussed pardoning Stewart Rhodes with Justice Department pardon attorney Ed Martin.",
    "story": [
      "New Justice Department pardon attorney Ed Martin has discussed pardon applications for some of the only remaining Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants who weren't given full clemency by President Trump, including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, a lawyer told CBS News.",
      "Peter Ticktin, an attorney working to secure full pardons for a number of Jan. 6 defendants, told CBS News he met with Martin last week to discuss pardon requests for Rhodes and 10 others. Martin was in his first full week in his new job as pardon attorney after Mr. Trump withdrew his nomination to serve as U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C.",
      "Martin posted photos of his meeting with Ticktin on X last week, saying Ticktin had \"recommendations for pardons\" and \"I listened.\" CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "Ticktin said that in addition to a potential pardon for Rhodes, pardon applications were discussed for Proud Boys Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola. Ticktin also mentioned applications for Dan Wilson and Elias Costianes, two other Jan 6 defendants who still face prison sentences due to firearm charges unrelated to the Capitol riot.",
      "Politico was first to report on Ticktin's conversation about Rhodes.",
      "Mr. Trump issued pardons to almost everybody convicted over the Jan. 6 riot on the first day of his second term, and he directed any pending charges to be dropped.",
      "However, a group of 14 current and former members of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers \u2014 including Rhodes \u2014 were only given commutations that allowed them to leave prison but left their criminal convictions in place. Many of those defendants were found guilty of more serious charges, like conspiring to use force to resist the transfer of power and seditious conspiracy.",
      "More than 1,500 people were charged as a result of their alleged conduct on Jan. 6, and at least 1,100 have had their cases adjudicated and received sentences, according to Justice Department data. More than 700 defendants completed their sentences or did not receive sentences of incarceration. More than 170 people were accused of using a deadly or dangerous weapon, such as a fire extinguisher or bear spray, against police officers, prosecutors have said.",
      "Ticktin is working with Jan. 6 defendant Trenniss Evans, who was sentenced to 36 months of probation and 20 days of prison time for his actions on Jan. 6. He pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building in 2022.",
      "Evans, who is CEO of the conservative nonprofit American Rights Alliance, told CBS News his expectation is that the 11 pardon applications submitted to Martin will go through the standard review process. He said his group had so far received no assurances from Martin or the Justice Department on whether the pardons will be granted.",
      "\"The only assurances that we have is that we have people that are in the Justice Department now and in the proper places in the administration that are going to give a realistic and fair review to these cases because of the nauseating stance that the previous administration took against individuals related to January 6,\" Evans told CBS News.",
      "The next step in the pardon process, Ticktin said, is for Martin to consult with Alice Johnson, Mr. Trump's \"pardon czar,\" who was granted clemency in Mr. Trump's first term after more than two decades of prison time for a nonviolent drug offense.",
      "\"She's got a pretty important position at this point. I mean, she's the one that has to decide these things,\" Ticktin told CBS News. \"Pardons need to be given out, but at the same time, none should be given out, you know, indiscriminately.\"",
      "Ticktin said he is working with Mark McCloskey, the man who infamously pointed a firearm at Black Lives Matter protestors back in 2020, to file civil suits against the government for their treatment of Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "\"These are good American citizens, the kind of people that most people would enjoy being with, except that they were used as pawns here and incarcerated the way they were,\" Ticktin told CBS News.",
      "How Trump has used his pardon power",
      "So far in his second term, Mr. Trump has pardoned Democratic former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted on public corruption charges related to attempts to sell former President Barack Obama's old U.S. Senate seat, and Ross Ulbricht, who was sent to life in prison for his role in creating and operating the darknet market Silk Road.",
      "On Monday, Trump said he was pardoning Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted of making several businessmen sworn law enforcement officers in exchange for cash bribes.",
      "The Constitution gives presidents virtually limitless power to pardon people for federal crimes. Many presidents have drawn controversy for how they've used this power: Mr. Trump issued pardons in his first term to his former campaign chair Paul Manafort and his son-in-law's father Charles Kushner, while Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter and Bill Clinton pardoned financier Marc Rich. But legal experts say Mr. Trump's clemency for Jan. 6 rioters \u2014 including people convicted of assaulting law enforcement officers \u2014 has been particularly broad, especially after Mr. Trump previously said he planned on offering \"case-by-case\" pardons to riot defendants.",
      "Ticktin said that he also spoke to Martin about former Arkansas State Senator Jonathan Woods, who was sentenced in 2018 to more than 18 years in prison for a bribery scheme. Woods' case was prosecuted in part by former special counsel Jack Smith when he led the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section between 2010 and 2015, before prosecuting Mr. Trump.",
      "In addition to the 11 pardon applications submitted last week, Evans said his group is working to \"seek justice\" for Tina Peters, a former Mesa County, Colorado, clerk who was sentenced to over eight years in prison on state charges. Peters was convicted of giving a man affiliated with MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell \u2014 a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated in the 2020 election \u2014 access to county election systems.",
      "Jurors found Peters guilty of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with Colorado's Secretary of State. Since her charges were in state court, Mr. Trump is unable to pardon her.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

      "While later earning millions from their reality TV show, the couple concealed their income from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes, while also failing to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "Julie Chrisley was also convicted of obstruction of justice.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy issued a nationwide injunction in the dispute over deportations to third countries last month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to lift a lower court order that blocked immigration authorities from removing migrants to third countries without first providing them certain due process rights while a legal battle over President Trump's deportation efforts continues.",
      "The request for emergency relief from Solicitor General D. John Sauer stems from a preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy last month in a challenge brought by four migrants who are subject to final orders of removal.",
      "The district judge's order prevented the administration from deporting any migrant detainee unless it first provides written notice of the third country \u2014 one other than their home country \u2014 to which they may be removed, and gives them a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise a fear of torture, persecution or death in that third country, among other conditions. In his ruling, Murphy found it is likely that federal immigration officials \"have applied and will continue to apply the alleged policy of removing aliens to third countries without notice and an opportunity to be heard on fear-based claims \u2014 in other words, without due process.\"",
      "\"Defendants argue that the United States may send a deportable alien to a country not of their origin, not where an immigration judge has ordered, where they may be immediately tortured and killed, without providing that person any opportunity to tell the deporting authorities that they face grave danger or death because of such a deportation,\" Murphy wrote. \"All nine sitting justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, the assistant solicitor general of the United States, Congress, common sense, basic decency, and this court all disagree.\"",
      "But in seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer accused the district court of stalling the administration's efforts to remove what he described as \"some of the worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" Sauer wrote. \"In addition to usurping the Executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "The emergency appeal is the latest in which the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to step into the slew of legal battles targeting many aspects of President Trump's second-term agenda. But the president's policies on immigration, in particular, have created escalating showdowns with the federal judiciary.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's efforts to crack down on immigration, his administration has approached countries like Libya, Rwanda and Costa Rica to accept migrants who are not their citizens, according to documents obtained by CBS News. The Trump administration has already sent more than 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they are being detained at its notorious prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "Mr. Trump began his efforts to target migrants in the U.S. illegally on his first day back in the White House, when he directed the Department of Homeland Security to take action to detain and deport those who had been ordered removed but were still in the U.S.",
      "Following that directive, the department ordered immigration officials to \"determine the viability of removal to a third country\" for those migrants, which are deportations to a country other than the ones designated on an order of removal.",
      "The four migrants who brought the case now before the Supreme Court alleged that there are \"valid reasons to fear removal to specific countries\" that were not listed in their removal orders and said that their due process rights would be violated if the government did not provide them with notice and an opportunity to be heard before they were deported to a third country.",
      "The migrants first secured a temporary restraining order in late March, followed by the injunction in mid-April. The Trump administration appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, though it declined to immediately halt the district court's order.",
      "But as proceedings continued, lawyers told the court in a filing that migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared for removal to Libya, \"a country notorious for its human rights violations.\"",
      "Then, last week, immigration lawyers again told Murphy that they had received information that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam may have been boarded on a plane bound for South Sudan, in violation of his preliminary injunction. South Sudan has been engaged in a bloody civil war for more than a decade and the State Department has warned Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.\"",
      "On May 21, the Trump administration confirmed it had placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a removal flight to South Sudan. The judge then said that the government had \"unquestionably\" violated his order blocking deportations to third countries without providing migrants the chance to contest their removal and ordered the administration to give six deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews, with the opportunity to have a lawyer of their choosing present during the interview.",
      "Reasonable fear interviews typically assess whether a migrant can stay in the U.S. because of a risk of persecution or torture.",
      "The judge said the Department of Homeland Security could provide this process to six of the migrants either within the U.S. or abroad if the government \"retains custody and control\" over them.",
      "Following the judge's order, Mr. Trump confirmed that the migrant detainees were being held at a military base in Djibouti, a small African country.",
      "In his filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer lambasted the district court's orders, writing that \"the United States has been put to the intolerable choice of holding these aliens for additional proceedings at a military facility on foreign soil \u2014 where each day of their continued confinement risks grave harm to American foreign policy \u2014 or bringing these convicted criminals back to America.\"",

Mike Braun opted to leave the Senate, too, after winning his 2024 bid for Indiana governor. The developments defy what's been a more traditional progression from the governor's mansion to the Senate. Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia, John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Rick Scott of Florida were all governors, and former Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was also governor before he served in the Senate.",

      "President Trump is pressuring California officials to prevent a transgender student from competing in the girls' state track and field finals there, threatening to withhold funding if they don't comply.",
      "Without naming the student, Mr. Trump took to Truth Social on Tuesday, advising that federal funding \"will be held back, maybe permanently,\" if state and local authorities don't do as he says. The president\u00a0signed an executive order\u00a0in February banning transgender girls and women from competing on\u00a0sports teams\u00a0that match their gender identity, and stating that it's the policy of the U.S. to \"rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he'll be speaking with California Gov. Gavin Newsom about the situation soon, although it's unclear if they have a call scheduled.",
      "\"California, under the leadership of Radical Left Democrat Gavin Newscum, continues to ILLEGALLY allow 'MEN TO PLAY IN WOMEN'S SPORTS,'\" the president wrote on social media, adding that California is allowing a trans student to compete.",
      "\"THIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"Please be hereby advised that large scale Federal Funding will be held back, maybe permanently, if the Executive Order on this subject matter is not adhered to. The Governor, himself, said it is 'UNFAIR.' I will speak to him today to find out which way he wants to go??? In the meantime I am ordering local authorities, if necessary, to not allow the transitioned person to compete in the State Finals. This is a totally ridiculous situation!!!\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond with further details about the student or the president's intention to speak with Newsom.",
      "On Tuesday, the California Interscholastic Federation, which oversees student sports,\u00a0announced a \"decision to pilot an entry process\" for the upcoming 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships.",
      "\"Under this pilot entry process, any biological female student-athlete who would have earned the next qualifying mark for one of their section's automatic qualifying entires in the CIF state at-large mark in the finals at their section meet, was extended the opportunity to participate in the 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships.\"",
      "Newsom's office called the pilot proposal a reasonable approach.",
      "\"CIF's proposed pilot is a reasonable, respectful way to navigate a complex issue without compromising competitive fairness \u2014 a model worth pursuing,\" said Izzy Gardon, director of communications for Newsom. \"The governor is encouraged by this thoughtful approach.\"",
      "AB Hernandez, a high school junior track and field athlete at Jurupa Valley High School, has received significant national attention after winning the long jump and triple jump at the CIF Southern Section Division III finals earlier this month, according to the posted results.

      "\"As previously stated, JUSD is required to follow both California law and CIF policy regarding school athletics,\" Jurupa Unified School District said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Both state law and CIF policy currently require that students be permitted to participate in athletic teams and competitions consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records. We remain committed to following the law as written and ensuring that all students are granted the rights afforded to them in a safe and welcoming environment.\"",

    "story": [
      "King Charles III spoke of a \"critical moment\" for Canada Tuesday as he addressed the Canadian Parliament in a rare gesture that comes as Canada grapples with tariffs and annexation threats by President Trump.",
      "\"The True North is indeed strong and free,\" Charles said, nodding to the Canadian national anthem.",
      "The British monarch, who formally serves as Canada's head of state, arrived in the capital of Ottawa on Monday, part of a two-day visit that's widely viewed as a form of pushback against Mr. Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Why did King Charles speak to Canada's parliament?",
      "The king delivered a \"Speech from the Throne,\" which marked the start of a new session of Parliament after the center-left Liberal Party won last month's federal election. The speech \u2014 written by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's office, not the king \u2014 outlined the new government's agenda and priorities, while acknowledging the political and economic dynamics on the world stage affecting the country.",
      "Marking the start of Parliament with a speech is a longstanding tradition in Canada and other former parts of the British Empire \u2014 but it's highly unusual for the king to deliver the speech himself. Instead, the king's representative in Canada, the governor-general, normally speaks on his behalf. The last time the monarch personally gave the speech was in 1977, when Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0traveled to Canada's capital for the event.",
      "In his address, the king cited his mother's visit to Canada to open its parliament in 1957, saying that the visit came as \"the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory,\" as the Cold War intensified, and \"freedom and democracy were under threat.\" Canada was \"emerging as a growing economic power and a force for peace in the world,\" he added, comparing the moment to the challenges of the present.",
      "\"Today, Canada faces another critical moment,\" Charles said, adding that \"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect.\"",
      "Is King Charles' visit to Ottawa related to Trump?",
      "Some watchers of Canadian politics said so ahead of the visit, especially as Mr. Trump has repeatedly mused about the United States annexing Canada, stirring strong backlash.",
      "Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta, says the royal visit could be \"an indication that the king takes Canada's sovereignty seriously.\"",
      "\"The explicit threats to Canada's sovereignty probably got the attention of the king and his advisers,\" Wesley told CBS News.",
      "The visit could also play to domestic politics, Wesley says. Mr. Trump's comments have \"stirred up patriotism in some odd corners of Canada,\" and the country's status as a constitutional monarchy where the king is still technically the head of state is one major difference between Canada and its neighbor to the south. And even though most Canadians are fairly indifferent toward the monarchy, visits by royals always draw interest.",
      "\"It's seen as a point of pride and distinction between Canada and the U.S.,\" said Wesley, who previously served in several roles for Alberta's provincial government.",
      "University of Toronto political science professor Elizabeth McCallion said the visit is likely intended as a \"reminder that we are an independent country\" and a \"rallying together of Canadians.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Carney told Sky News the invitation to Charles was \"not coincidental.\" In a statement welcoming Charles on Monday, the prime minister didn't mention Mr. Trump, but did hint at Canada's \"distinct identity\" and \"historic ties that crises only fortify.\"",
      "Charles also has a longstanding relationship with Canada, visiting the country over a dozen times before ascending to the throne. Amid a rocky relationship with the United States, many Canadians have looked for signs of support from Charles, taking note of symbolic gestures like the crown's decision to plant a maple tree at Buckingham Palace earlier this year, McCallion said.",
      "McCallion says some Canadians also believe Mr. Trump's longstanding fascination with the British royal family could play to the country's benefit.",
      "\"There's hope that when he's visiting, Trump will take notice and respect the fact that Canada has connections to the British monarchy,\" McCallion told CBS News.",
      "Charles is the head of state for both Canada and the U.K., putting him in an unusual position as the U.K. seeks a stronger trade relationship with the Trump administration. Earlier this month, Carney criticized the U.K. government for inviting Mr. Trump to a state visit earlier this year, presenting Mr. Trump with an invitation from the king. The Canadian leader told Sky News most Canadians \"weren't impressed by that gesture.\"",
      "What did King Charles say in the speech about the U.S. and Trump?",
      "The king alluded to the relationship between Canada and the U.S. throughout his speech, as he addressed changes to the global trade systems. Charles said open global trade, while \"not perfect,\" has \"helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades.\"",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about a drastically changing world around them,\" Charles said. \"Yet this moment is also an incredible opportunity \u2014 an opportunity for renewal. An opportunity to think big and to act bigger. An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War.\"",
      "The king emphasized that a \"confident Canada\" can \"seize this opportunity by recognizing that all Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away.\" He added that by staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians.",
      "The king made only a passing reference to Mr. Trump, saying Canada's prime minister and the U.S. president \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship\" that he said was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "What has Trump said about Canada \u2014 and how has Carney responded?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated annexing Canada in recent months, rattling Canadian politics.",
      "The 51st-state jabs sometimes appear tongue-in-cheek: Mr. Trump referred to Carney's predecessor \u2014 who stepped down as prime minister ahead of new elections this year \u2014 as \"Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada.\" In other cases, Mr. Trump has cast absorbing Canada as a tidy way of resolving the U.S.'s trade deficit with its northern neighbor.",
      "But Trudeau has reportedly called Mr. Trump's talk of absorbing Canada \"a real thing,\" telling business and labor leaders in a private meeting that he sees taking over Canada as a way of getting access to the country's mineral wealth, according to the public broadcaster CBC. Many Canadian voters hold the same view, according to McCallion.",
      "\"I think maybe the first or second time, people were offended but thought he was kidding. And at this point, certainly no Canadians think he's kidding,\" McCallion said. \"Most Canadians are taking it as a serious threat.\"",
      "When asked whether he would use military force to take over Canada, Mr. Trump said earlier this month, \"I don't see it.\" But in a White House meeting with Carney days later, the U.S. leader still called the idea of annexing Canada a \"wonderful marriage\" that would deliver \"tremendous\" benefits to Canada, and referred to the border between the two countries as \"artificial.\"",
      "Carney said in the meeting Canada \"won't be for sale, ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on many Canadian goods, leading Canada to hit the U.S. with retaliatory levies.",
      "Last month's Canadian elections were dominated by Mr. Trump's tariffs and annexation comments, and the race was widely seen as a referendum on who Canadians trusted more to deal with the Trump administration.",
      "Carney's Liberal Party \u2014 which has held power for almost a decade \u2014 previously trailed the Conservatives in polling, but its fortunes rebounded after Mr. Trump's jabs at Canada. In a victory speech, Carney said the country's \"old relationship with the United States \u2026 is over,\" and argued Mr. Trump is \"trying to break us so that America can own us.\"",
      "\"Our national identity is at times muddied because it's made up of so many different cultures that have come together,\" McCallion told CBS News. \"Often, Canadians primarily express their national identity as not being American.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has said it plans to move forward with the transfer of land in Tonto National Forest to a company that will develop a copper mine.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away a challenge from Native Americans seeking to block a copper mining project on government-owned land in Arizona that will destroy a sacred site used to perform religious ceremonies.",
      "The court rejected an appeal from the nonprofit organization Apache Stronghold, which challenged the transfer of the site known as Oak Flat to the mining company Resolution Copper. In turning away the case, the high court left in place a lower court ruling that allowed the land, located in Tonto National Forest, to be transferred for the development of the copper mine.",
      "Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas dissented from the Supreme Court's denial of the appeal. Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in the court's consideration of the case.",
      "Gorsuch, joined by Thomas, called the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the challenge a \"grave mistake\" and said the lower court's decision is an \"outlier.\"",
      "\"While this court enjoys the power to choose which cases it will hear, its decision to shuffle this case off our docket without a full airing is a grievous mistake \u2014 one with consequences that threaten to reverberate for generations,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"Just imagine if the government sought to demolish a historic cathedral on so questionable a chain of legal reasoning. I have no doubt that we would find that case worth our time. Faced with the government's plan to destroy an ancient site of tribal worship, we owe the Apaches no less.\"",
      "The federal government had for more than a century recognized Oak Flat's significance and protected the land, as well as the Apaches' access to it. The site includes old-growth oak groves, sacred springs and burial locations, according to court filings, and the Apaches consider Oak Flat to be \"a unique dwelling place of spiritual beings called Ga'an.\"",
      "But that changed after a copper deposit was discovered under the site in 1995. Seeking to obtain the deposit, two mining companies, Rio Tinto and BHP, created a joint venture called Resolution Copper.",
      "From 2005 to 2013, Resolution Copper's backers in Congress introduced legislation to transfer Oak Flat to the company, though the efforts were not successful. Then, in 2014, a land-transfer bill was included in a must-pass defense package, which authorized the transfer of roughly 2,422 acres including Oak Flat to Resolution Copper in exchange for other parcels of land.",
      "The legislation revoked prior presidential orders that protected Oak Flat from mining and directed the secretary of Agriculture to prepare an environmental impact statement for the project. That environmental impact statement, published in January 2021, confirmed that the copper mine would \"directly and permanently\" damage Oak Flat. To extract the copper, the company plans to use a technique called panel carving, which Apache Stronghold said would turn the site into a crater that is roughly 1,000 feet deep and nearly two miles wide.",
      "While the original environmental impact statement was withdrawn shortly after it was issued, the Trump administration has said that it plans to publish a final version next month and move forward with the land transfer to Resolution Copper.",
      "In an attempt to stop the exchange and subsequent destruction of Oak Flat, Apache Stronghold, which represents members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, filed a lawsuit in 2021, arguing that the move violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "A federal district court declined to block the land transfer, and a divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ultimately rejected Apache Stronghold's challenge, finding that the copper mining project did not impose a substantial burden on the tribes' religious exercise.",
      "The Forest Service has estimated that the project will create 3,500 jobs and contribute $1.2 billion to Arizona's economy each year. But lawyers for the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which worships at the site, said in court papers that Oak Flat \"is central to traditional Apache religion as the home of Apache deities and the only place where Apaches can practice unique ceremonies.\"",
      "Vicky Peacey, general manager of Resolution Copper, said the mine is \"vital to securing America's energy future, infrastructure needs, and national defense with a domestic supply of copper and other critical minerals.\"",
      "\"More than a decade of extensive consultation and collaboration with Native American Tribes and local communities has directly led to major changes to the mining plan to preserve and reduce potential impacts on Tribal, social, and cultural interests, and this ongoing dialogue will continue to shape the project,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Wendsler Nosie Sr. of Apache Stronghold called the Supreme Court's decision a \"heavy blow\" and urged Congress to act to stop the land transfer.",
      "\"We will never stop fighting \u2014 nothing will deter us from protecting Oak Flat from destruction,\" he said in a statement.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order in early May that seeks to end federal funds for NPR and PBS.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 NPR on Tuesday sued President Trump and administration officials over an executive order signed earlier this month that seeks to cut federal funding to the news organization and PBS.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the suit was brought by NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations. It argues that Mr. Trump's executive order violates the First Amendment and provisions of the Public Broadcasting Act, which was passed by Congress in 1967. The plaintiffs also assert that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to stop federal funding for NPR and PBS, and his order should be invalidated as unconstitutional.",
      "The order, NPR and the three stations said in their complaint, is \"textbook retaliation\" and discriminates based on viewpoint, which is a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "\"The order's objectives could not be clearer: the order aims to punish NPR for the content of news and other programming the president dislikes and chill the free exercise of First Amendment rights by NPR and individual public radio stations across the country,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, claimed in a statement that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \"is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime. Therefore, the president is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The president was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have long complained about NPR and accused it of being biased against conservatives.\u00a0Project 2025, the sweeping policy roadmap overseen by the Heritage Foundation, calls for defunding both NPR and PBS.",
      "The president's executive order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides public dollars to NPR and PBS, and other federal agencies to \"cease federal funding\" and indirect funding for the two outlets. The directive said that taxpayers \"have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage.\" The White House has claimed that the two outlets \"receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "NPR is primarily funded through sponsorships, donations, memberships and licensing fees from local radio stations, and direct funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal grants, though only roughly 1% of its budget comes directly from federal dollars, according to NPR CEO Katherine Maher. For the 2024 fiscal year, NPR received roughly $11.1 million in grants from the corporation for programming and to support the Public Radio Satellite System, which is the country's public radio interconnection system.",
      "But the president's executive order targeting NPR and PBS was just one step he has taken to target public media. Last month, the president attempted to fire three officials with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was created by Congress in 1967 as a private nonprofit entity to ensure investment in public broadcasting. The corporation says it distributes more than 70% of its funding to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations.",
      "The ousted members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's board of directors sued the Trump administration over their removal, arguing the president did not have the power to fire them.",
      "In their lawsuit, NPR, Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio and KSUT Public Radio said that Mr. Trump's executive order violates the \"express will of Congress\" and their First Amendment rights. The news outlets warned that the president's directive \"threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.\"",
      "\"The Executive Order is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press. It is an affront to the rights of NPR and NPR's 246 Member stations, which are locally owned, nonprofit, noncommercial media organizations serving all 50 states and territories,\" Maher said in a statement. \"Today, we challenge its constitutionality in the nation's independent courts.\"",

    "summary": "FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said three high-profile investigations are being reexamined.",
    "story": [
      "FBI deputy director Dan Bongino announced early Monday that three high-profile cases are being reexamined: The investigations into the 2021 D.C. pipe bombings, cocaine found in the White House in 2023 and the 2022 leak of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision\u00a0ending the federal right to an abortion.",
      "\"Shortly after swearing in, the Director and I evaluated a number of cases of potential public corruption that, understandably, have garnered public interest,\" Bongino said in a statement. \"We made the decision to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases.\"",
      "Bongino said he has requested weekly updates on these cases, and \"we are making progress.\"",
      "The identity of the person who\u00a0planted two pipe bombs\u00a0on Capitol Hill the night before the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, remains a mystery over four years later. Occurring in the final days of the first Trump administration, the incident was mainly investigated by the FBI during the Biden administration, under Christopher Wray, who was FBI director from 2017 through January 2025, and\u00a0resigned shortly before President Trump took office. Mr. Trump tapped allies Kash Patel as FBI director and Bongino as his deputy.",
      "The earliest case that Bongino announced was being reexamined occurred when pipe bombs were discovered by a passerby around 1 p.m. Jan. 6, 2021, at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and near the Republican National Committee headquarters as Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results. Both buildings are near the Capitol.",
      "Investigators believe both pipe bombs were left between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the Democratic National Committee headquarters when the devices were recovered.",
      "No suspect has ever publicly been named, although earlier this year, investigators released security camera video showing the suspect sitting on a park bench, reaching into his backpack and planting a pipe bomb outside the DNC.",
      "According to a report obtained by CBS News in March 2021, the bombs contained only one method of detonation \u2014 a 60-minute kitchen timer. The devices did not go off, and when and whether they were meant to explode remains unclear. But the FBI said its analysis concluded the pipe bombs were viable and posed a danger to the public.",
      "Another case Bongino plans to reexamine is the 2022 leak of the Supreme Court's draft opinion in the Dobbs case, which sought to overturn the 1973 Roe decision that made abortion legal nationwide. A draft opinion of a Supreme Court had never before been leaked, and at the time, Chief Justice John Roberts denounced the leak as a \"betrayal\"\u00a0and \"a singular and egregious betrayal of trust\" that would be fully investigated.",
      "An eight-month investigation was conducted by the marshal of the Supreme Court, who consulted with former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, but investigators were unable to find the leaker.",
      "In a 20-page report released with a Supreme Court statement saying the leaker could not be identified, Marshal of the Supreme Court Gail Curley said it is \"unlikely\" the leak stemmed from a hack of the court's IT systems by a person outside the court. But after examining the Supreme Court's computer devices, networks, printers and available call and text logs, investigators found \"no forensic evidence indicating who disclosed the draft opinion.\"",
      "The final case cited by Bongino was the discovery of cocaine at the White House on July 2, 2023. The Secret Service closed the investigation after 11 days, saying it had compiled a list of \"several hundred\" people who may have accessed the area where the substance was discovered. But no fingerprints could be found on the cocaine's packaging and there was \"insufficient DNA\" for \"investigative comparisons,\" the Secret Service said at the time.",

      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years after that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 21:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "After back-to-back Starship upper stage failures, SpaceX on Tuesday again launched the world's most powerful rocket, but faced new problems.",
    "story": [
      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

    "story": [
      "Johann Strauss II's \"Blue Danube\" is heading into space this month to mark the 200th anniversary of the waltz king's birth.",
      "The classical piece will be beamed into the cosmos as it's performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The celestial send-off on May 31 \u2014 livestreamed with free public screenings in Vienna, Madrid and New York \u2014 also will celebrate the European Space Agency's founding 50 years ago.",
      "Although the music could be converted into radio signals in real time, according to officials, ESA will relay a pre-recorded version from the orchestra's rehearsal the day before to avoid any technical issues. The live performance will provide the accompaniment.",
      "The radio signals will hurtle away at the speed of light, or a mind-blowing 670 million mph (more than 1 billion kph).",
      "That will put the music past the moon in 1 \u00bd seconds, past Mars in 4 \u00bd minutes, past Jupiter in 37 minutes and past Neptune in four hours. Within 23 hours, the signals will be as far from Earth as NASA's Voyager 1, the world's most distant spacecraft at more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) in interstellar space.",
      "NASA also celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 by transmitting a song directly into deep space: the Beatles' \"Across the Universe.\" And last year, NASA beamed up Missy Elliott's\u00a0\"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" toward Venus.",
      "Music has even flowed from another planet to Earth \u2014 courtesy of a NASA Mars rover. Flight controllers at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent a recording of will.i.am's \"Reach for the Stars\" to Curiosity in 2012 and the rover relayed it back.",
      "These are all deep-space transmissions as opposed to the melodies streaming between NASA's Mission Control and orbiting crews since the mid-1960s.",
      "Now it's Strauss' turn, after getting passed over for the Voyager Golden Records nearly a half-century ago.",
      "Launched in 1977, NASA's twin Voyagers 1 and 2 each carry a gold-plated copper phonograph record, along with a stylus and playing instructions for anyone or anything out there.",
      "The records contain sounds and images of Earth as well as 90 minutes of music. The late astronomer Carl Sagan led the committee that chose Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Stravinsky pieces, along with modern and Indigenous selections.",
      "Among those skipped was Strauss, whose \"Blue Danube\" graced Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi opus \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"",
      "The tourist board in Vienna, where Strauss was born on Oct. 25, 1825, said it aims to correct this \"cosmic mistake\" by sending the \"the most famous of all waltzes\" to its destined home among the stars.",
      "ESA's big radio antenna in Spain, part of the space agency's deep-space network, will do the honors. The dish will be pointed in the direction of Voyager 1 so the \"Blue Danube\" heads that way.",
      "\"Music connects us all through time and space in a very particular way,\" ESA's director general Josef Aschbacher said in a statement. \"The European Space Agency is pleased to share the stage with Johann Strauss II and open the imaginations of future space scientists and explorers who may one day journey to the anthem of space.\"",

      "Divine Right",
      "Everyone else had arrived, but Elon Musk was late as usual. It was the summer of 2015, and a group of men had gathered for a private dinner at Sam Altman's invitation to discuss the future of AI and humanity.",
      "Musk had met Altman, fourteen years his junior, a while earlier and had formed a good impression. President of the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, Altman's reputation preceded him. After starting his first company at age nineteen, he had rapidly established himself within Silicon Valley as a brilliant strategist and dealmaker with grand ambitions, even for the land of big\u2011thinking founders. Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like\u2011minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. It was as if, Musk would describe in a lawsuit years later, Altman had mirrored everything Musk had ever said about the subject to win his trust.",
      "For Altman's part, he often said that Musk had been a childhood hero. After the older entrepreneur had shown him around the sprawling SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, that admiration had only deepened. \"The thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars,\" Altman wrote later of the experience. \"I left thinking 'huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like.'\"",
      "Musk had been deeply concerned about AI for some time. In 2012, he'd met Demis Hassabis, the professorial CEO of the London\u2011based AI lab DeepMind Technologies. Shortly thereafter, Hassabis had also paid Musk a visit at his SpaceX factory. As the two men sat in the canteen, surrounded by the sounds of massive rocket parts being transported and assembled, Hassabis raised the possibility that more advanced AI, of the kind that might one day exceed human intelligence, could pose a threat to humanity. What's more, Musk's fail\u2011safe of colonizing Mars to escape would not work in this scenario. Superintelligence, Hassabis said with amusement, would simply follow humans into the galaxy. Musk, decidedly less amused, invested $5 million in DeepMind to keep tabs on the company.",
      "Later, at his 2013 birthday party in the lush wine\u2011growing landscapes of Napa Valley, Musk had gotten into a heated and emotional debate with his longtime friend and Google cofounder Larry Page over whether AI surpassing human intelligence was in fact a problem. Page didn't think so, calling it the next stage of evolution. When Musk balked, Page accused him of being a \"specist,\" discriminating against nonhuman species.",
      "After that, Musk began to speak incessantly about the existential risk of AI. At an MIT symposium, he described AI as probably the \"biggest existential threat\" to humanity and its development as \"summoning the demon.\" He met with publishers in New York, gripped by the thought of writing his own book about extinction\u2011level threats, including AI. Later, at a recurring AI Salon event at Stanford, a young researcher named Timnit Gebru would come up to him after a talk and ask him why he was so obsessed with AI when the threat of climate change was more clearly existential. \"Climate change is bad, but it's not going to kill everyone,\" he said. \"AI could render humanity extinct.\"",

      "President Trump threatened to impose a fresh round of tariffs Friday morning, including a 25% tariff on Apple if they do not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S.",
      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "summary": "Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who's led the department since the Capitol riot, spoke with CBS News before his retirement.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who took charge of the department in the difficult months after the U.S. Capitol siege, is retiring from his position Friday. After the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, he helped rebuild the department's shrunken staff, beefed up recruitment efforts and bolstered the agency's intelligence operations and communications to fix weaknesses revealed by the breach of the Capitol.",
      "Manger told CBS News he faced stiff challenges when he arrived on the job in 2021.",
      "\"The department as a whole had lost confidence in the (prior) leadership as a result of what happened,\" he said. \"And there were big things that were identified as things that needed to be fixed as quickly as we could fix them: Things like the intelligence failures, the communication failures, the equipment failures, the training failures, the leadership failures \u2014 all of those things needed to be addressed immediately.\"",
      "Manger, a former local police chief in Fairfax County, Virginia, and Montgomery County, Maryland, successfully advocated for increases in funding to improve hiring, equipment and operations.",
      "The department was blasted by critics for intelligence failures that contributed to the violation of the complex on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"We now have a world class intelligence operation. We are significant players in the intelligence community in the Washington, D.C., region and, frankly, all over the country,\" Manger said. \"Whereas before, we were basically just \u2014... we were consumers of information. The FBI would give us intelligence, other agencies would give us intelligence. Now we are gathering our own.\"",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police Board will select a new police chief, which Manger predicts will happen soon.",
      "Manger has requested nearly $1 billion in funding for 2026, which would represent the latest in a series of recent budget boosts for the department. In testimony before a congressional committee on justifying his budget request, Manger cited an elevated number of investigations into threats against members of Congress.",
      "\"The current climate of threats has reached alarming levels,\" he told the committee in April. Capitol Police records show the number of threats launched against congressional members in 2024 exceeded 9,400.",
      "He added, \"Social media and the internet provide a breeding ground for threats that \u2014 regardless of their nature \u2014 the department must investigate.\"",
      "Manger and the Capitol Police have also bolstered the department's operations outside of Washington, responding to potential threats in the hometowns of lawmakers.",
      "The department has a unique mission among police agencies, protecting elected leaders and securing the U.S. Capitol campus, which hosts over 3 million visitors each year. The Capitol is open to the public, and lawmakers are accessible to citizens.",
      "Manger has been critical of the pardons issued by President Trump to free Capitol rioters who beat, clubbed and gassed Capitol Police and other officers during the attack on the Capitol. He told CBS News that when Mr. Trump issued 1,500 pardons to the suspected and convicted rioters when he took office, it \"was probably one of my worst days in this job.\"",
      "He also blasted conspiracy theories about Jan. 6 that continue to circulate on social media.",
      "\"My folks were here on Jan. 6. They were part of what went on. They were assaulted,\" Manger said. \"They were in fights. Many of them were injured. They know exactly what happened on Jan. 6. For somebody to make up some story that, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad,' \u2014 it is just not true.\"",
      "\"What a chilling message to law enforcement, because we've got a job to do, and we don't care what the issue is,\" Manger continued. \"We don't care what side of the coin you're on on any particular issue because we have a job to do, to maintain public order and to keep the peace.\"",
      "Rep. Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, said of Manger, \"Since taking over at the department's hour of greatest need, he professionalized a force in need of steady leadership.\"",
      "A union representative for Capitol Police officers told CBS News, \"Manpower is still an issue, as well as balancing work and family life for the rank and file officers, which continues to plague morale within the agency.\"",
      "As he prepares to leave the department, Manger was lauded by one of the former Capitol Police officers who responded to the Jan. 6 riot. Former officer Harry Dunn told CBS News, \"He showed his love for country, his love for law enforcement and his continued dedication to public service.\"",

    "summary": "Here's why young workers with college degree are faring poorly in the labor market, according to a report.",
    "story": [
      "Recent college graduates are having a harder time finding work, despite their higher education degrees, which usually give job-seekers a leg up in the labor market.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Oxford Economics which shows that unemployed recent college grads account for 12% of an 85% rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. That's a high number, given that this cohort only makes up 5% of the total labor force.",
      "What's more, the rate of unemployment among workers who have recently graduated from college and are between the ages of 22 and 27, is nearing 6% \u2014which is above the national unemployment rate of 4.2%.",
      "\"People who have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher have a higher unemployment rate than national average, and this is the first time this has happened in the last 45 years of data,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That's noteworthy, he said, because \"those with higher educational attainment usually have better prospects overall than their peer with less.\"",
      "So why are recent college grads are having a tougher time finding work post-college than previous graduating classes did?",
      "While the report points to a couple of factors, it finds that a slowdown in hiring in formerly hot sectors is driving the growth in unemployment among degree holders.",
      "\"The rise in the recent graduate unemployment rate is largely part of a mismatch between an oversupply of recent graduates in fields where business demand has waned,\" according to the report.",
      "That holds especially true in the tech industry, as more college students graduate with degrees in computer science and related fields than any other major.",
      "\"Prospects for employment will remain minimal for these individuals, keeping the unemployment rate elevated in the near term,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in the report.",
      "Tech sector-centric",
      "Computer science is among the fastest-growing fields of study among undergrads, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, but jobs in the sector are particularly vulnerable to replacement by automation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence also expose workers in the field to being rendered obsolete.",
      "\"There's a mismatch between business demand and the labor supply overall,\" Martin said. \"And it's very concentrated in the technology sector.\"",
      "The industry hired at a fast clip when the economy reopened post-pandemic, before pulling back. Those cuts are likely still affecting the current unemployment rate, according to Martin.",
      "\"Some of it could be a normalization after the tech sector's hiring surge at the end of the pandemic around 2021,\" he said. \"But there's also evidence that AI is starting to impact lower-level computer science gigs,\" he added.",
      "Experienced workers who graduated with computer science degrees but have racked up more than a few years of experience are faring fine, noted Martin. It's those who do the kind of lower-level, rote work that AI is already adept at, who are seeing a mismatch between the number of jobs available and the supply of workers seeking them.",
      "\"Some of it might be businesses being productive with the workers they have and not wanting to increase costs overall by hiring. It could also be higher adoption rates of AI,\" Martin said. \"At the moment, it looks to be a bit of both.\"",
      "Uncertainty slows hiring",
      "Economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's aggressive, yet ever-changing tariff agenda, is also leading a number of businesses to press pause on growth and investment. Because of this, the unemployment rate among recent college graduates could continue to inch upward, according to Martin.",
      "\"We are heading into a period where uncertainty is really high; the impact of tariffs is starting to bleed through, and businesses are facing higher input costs,\" he said.",
      "Although recent college graduates who have secured employment aren't being laid off at higher rates than the rest of the workforce, Martin doesn't expect things to get easier for young graduates on the hunt for employment, absent a surge in hiring by tech companies or mass exodus of workers from the labor force.",
      "\"There is some softening in demand overall, but a lot of it is concentrated at the moment in recent college graduates, and we are looking for the unemployment rate to rise,\" he said.",
      "The \"underemployment\" effect",
      "When qualified workers with college degrees try and fail to find work in their desired field, they tend to continue seeking work, sometimes looking for a job in another sector, as opposed to withdrawing from the labor force, the report notes. That can lead to college-educated workers finding themselves \"underemployed,\" or in roles where 50% of the workers who occupy them do not have a bachelor's degree or higher.",
      "This scenario can doom them for years to come: Underemployed workers tend to remain so for the rest of their careers, according to a report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-super-heavy-starship-launch-ninth-test-flight/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 21:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "After back-to-back Starship upper stage failures, SpaceX on Tuesday again launched the world's most powerful rocket, but faced new problems.",
    "story": [
      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

      "The league said its investigation included gathering information from fans, team and arena staff, as well as an \"audio and video review of the game.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the quick action by the league and the Indiana Fever to take this matter seriously and to investigate,\" Chicago Sky CEO and President Adam Fox said in a statement. \"This process demonstrates the league's strong stance on stopping hate at all WNBA games and events, and we will continue to support those efforts.\"",
      "The WNBA, according to a person familiar with the investigation, was looking into claims that racist comments were directed toward Chicago's Angel Reese by fans during the loss to WNBA rookie of the year Caitlin Clark and the Fever. Indiana won the game handily, 93-58.",
      "Reese, who is Black, and Clark, who is White, were meeting for the seventh time in their\u00a0ongoing \u2014 and much-talked-about \u2014 rivalry. Clark later said she did not hear any racist remarks during that game, but\u00a0acknowledged that it was loud\u00a0in Indiana's arena throughout the game.",
      "\"It's super loud in here, and though I didn't hear anything, I think that's why they're doing the investigation,\" Clark said earlier this month. \"That's why they're looking into it. That doesn't mean nothing happened, so I'll just trust the league's investigation, and I'm sure they'll do the right thing.\"",
      "Both teams had previously issued statements supporting the investigation, as did the WNBA Players Association. The Sky were playing in Phoenix on Tuesday. The WNBPA did not issue any immediate comment after the league's announcement.",

    "summary": "Kennedy's move appears to shortcut the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, dropping COVID vaccines from the list recommended for children and pregnant women.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated for COVID-19.",
      "\"I couldn't be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule,\" Kennedy said in a video attached to his post.",
      "However, as of Tuesday morning, the CDC had so far not updated the immunization schedule to reflect the removal announced by Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's move, announced Tuesday on X, appears to effectively shortcut a process set up by the agency's outside advisers to discuss and make changes to the CDC's influential vaccination guidance, which is directly tied to what insurers are required to cover and liability protections.",
      "Those advisers had already been weighing whether and how to narrow the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and other people with an underlying condition that put them at risk of more severe illness from COVID-19.",
      "Kennedy's announcement also goes further than the advisory panel, which had been weighing including pregnant women as among those who would remain eligible for COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, given their increased risk of severe disease and the fact that it could also help provide some protection to their newborns.",
      "It is not clear why Kennedy chose to announce the decision without waiting for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to complete its deliberations. The panel had been expected to vote on the issue at the routinely scheduled June meeting hosted by the agency.",
      "\"With the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, it is time to move forward. HHS and the CDC remain committed to gold standard science and to ensuring the health and well-being of all Americans \u2014 especially our nation's children \u2014 using common sense,\" Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email.",
      "Kennedy has also stalled other overdue recommendations from the panel for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccines and meningococcal vaccines.",
      "The committee had voted on updated recommendations for those vaccines in April. Usually it is up to the CDC director to approve the recommendations. But it has been up to Kennedy to decide whether to adopt the new guidance, since the Trump administration has not appointed an acting CDC director to replace Susan Monarez, who stepped aside from that role while she goes through the nomination process for CDC director.",
      "Only one recommendation from the April meeting, an update to restrict use of a Chikungunya vaccine linked to potentially severe side effects, has been greenlighted by Kennedy.",
      "HHS has not responded to requests for comment on why the other recommendations have been delayed.",
      "Can you still get a COVID vaccination for your children or if you're pregnant?",
      "While COVID-19 vaccines still remain available for now, experts say that access to the shots for children and during pregnancy could get harder once Kennedy's changes are official.",
      "The CDC's immunization guidance is closely watched by health experts because it serves as the basis for\u00a0legal requirements for which vaccines health insurance plans are required to cover with no cost-sharing.",
      "Removing the CDC's recommendations for children and pregnant women to be routinely vaccinated could mean those patients might have to start paying out of pocket for some or all of the cost of COVID-19 shots.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations also govern access to the shots through the federal Vaccines for Children program, which provides COVID-19 vaccines to uninsured children. Guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, requiring coverage of vaccinations to children and during pregnancy, is also tied to the CDC's recommendations.",
      "According to the CDC's price lists, the private sector price tag for COVID-19 vaccines starts at $57.50 per dose in children and $136.75 in adults.",
      "Another way that removing the recommendation could narrow availability of the shots is through the liability protections that Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response issued during the COVID-19 pandemic, expanding access to the shots for children in places like pharmacies.",
      "Spokespeople for CDC, ASPR and CMS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"That would essentially close the door to pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant women at pharmacies. And as we know, throughout the pandemic and over the last few years, the pharmacy has been the primary location where many have been receiving their vaccines,\" said Richard Dang, assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.",
      "Dang represents the American Pharmacists Association on the COVID-19 work group to CDC's vaccine advisers. He previously led the city COVID-19 vaccination program in Los Angeles.",
      "While Dang said there are other pathways for states to enable pharmacists to continue giving COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant patients, he warned those were challenging to implement and unlikely to resolve issues with insurance coverage of the shots caused by the change.",
      "\"Even if a pharmacy were allowed to administer vaccine off-label through a protocol or collaborative practice agreement, the individual patient would likely have to pay cash for it,\" Dang said.",
      "Why were COVID-19 vaccines recommended during pregnancy?",
      "The move also puts Kennedy at odds with his new officials at the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration, who\u00a0recently said\u00a0pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals.",
      "\"This one preventive strategy that is cost-effective, that can be readily available when the ACIP provides a universal recommendation, limits barriers to access. It is a really important mechanism to protect our moms and babies,\" said Dr. Naima Joseph, assistant professor at Boston University.",
      "Like Dang, Joseph is also a member of the COVID-19 work group to the CDC's vaccine advisers. Joseph represents the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",
      "A statement released by the OB-GYN organization Tuesday voiced frustration with Kennedy's move, warning that COVID infections during pregnancy \"can be catastrophic\" for families and that \"the science has not changed.\"",
      "Joseph said data still shows that pregnant people have an increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized. She also said newborns have no other way to get protection from the virus, outside of the mother's vaccination.",
      "\"Infants are the second leading group of our population being hospitalized. And when we look into those risks, it's really that they're born to moms who haven't received an updated COVID-19 vaccine,\" said Joseph.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment when asked why Kennedy was excluding pregnant moms from getting COVID-19 vaccines.",

    "summary": "Southwest Airlines, which previously had a free checked bag policy, says it will start charging $35 for each first checked bag.",
    "story": [
      "After more than 50 years, Southwest Airlines' \"bags fly free\" policy is finally coming to an end.",
      "Southwest on Tuesday announced the first checked bag will cost $35, while a second checked bag will cost $45. The policy will begin tomorrow, when some passengers may be subject to a checked bag fee when booking a flight on the discount carrier. Weight and size limits for bags will apply.",
      "The new policy only applies to flights booked on May 28 or later, which means today is the last day to book if passengers want to avoid the new fee.",
      "There are, however, some carve-outs to the new policy: Business Select/Choice Extra and A-List Preferred customers will receive two free checked bags, while A-List and Chase Rapid Reward credit card members will get one free checked bag.",
      "In addition to the checked bag fees, a new flight credit policy will also take effect tomorrow, affecting how long Southwest customers can use their travel vouchers.",
      "Flight credits issued May 28 or later will expire in six months or a year, depending on the fare type. This marks a change to the airline's previous policy\u00a0in place for three years, which had said flight credits never expire.",
      "The airlines stock price was up 2.1% in pre-trading.",
      "Southwest announced the end of its free bag check policy in March amid mounting pressure from activist investors to improve its financial performance. The airline in September predicted that the change would lead to $1.5 billion a year in revenue but said it also stood to lose $1.8 billion in business from loyal customers who flew Southwest because of its unique baggage policy.",
      "The new checked bag policy is part of a broader set of changes announced by Southwest. The airline\u00a0said last July\u00a0that it would start selling assigned seats, a major departure from its longstanding open seating policy.",
      "In April, the airline gave customers their first glimpse of what new seating options would look like when it announced its new fare structure. As part of the offerings, customers will now be able to pay for extra legroom.",
      "Customers can start booking the new fare bundles in the third quarter of 2025 for flights that depart in 2026, according to the airline.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy issued a nationwide injunction in the dispute over deportations to third countries last month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to lift a lower court order that blocked immigration authorities from removing migrants to third countries without first providing them certain due process rights while a legal battle over President Trump's deportation efforts continues.",
      "The request for emergency relief from Solicitor General D. John Sauer stems from a preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy last month in a challenge brought by four migrants who are subject to final orders of removal.",
      "The district judge's order prevented the administration from deporting any migrant detainee unless it first provides written notice of the third country \u2014 one other than their home country \u2014 to which they may be removed, and gives them a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise a fear of torture, persecution or death in that third country, among other conditions. In his ruling, Murphy found it is likely that federal immigration officials \"have applied and will continue to apply the alleged policy of removing aliens to third countries without notice and an opportunity to be heard on fear-based claims \u2014 in other words, without due process.\"",
      "\"Defendants argue that the United States may send a deportable alien to a country not of their origin, not where an immigration judge has ordered, where they may be immediately tortured and killed, without providing that person any opportunity to tell the deporting authorities that they face grave danger or death because of such a deportation,\" Murphy wrote. \"All nine sitting justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, the assistant solicitor general of the United States, Congress, common sense, basic decency, and this court all disagree.\"",
      "But in seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer accused the district court of stalling the administration's efforts to remove what he described as \"some of the worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" Sauer wrote. \"In addition to usurping the Executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "The emergency appeal is the latest in which the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to step into the slew of legal battles targeting many aspects of President Trump's second-term agenda. But the president's policies on immigration, in particular, have created escalating showdowns with the federal judiciary.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's efforts to crack down on immigration, his administration has approached countries like Libya, Rwanda and Costa Rica to accept migrants who are not their citizens, according to documents obtained by CBS News. The Trump administration has already sent more than 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they are being detained at its notorious prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "Mr. Trump began his efforts to target migrants in the U.S. illegally on his first day back in the White House, when he directed the Department of Homeland Security to take action to detain and deport those who had been ordered removed but were still in the U.S.",
      "Following that directive, the department ordered immigration officials to \"determine the viability of removal to a third country\" for those migrants, which are deportations to a country other than the ones designated on an order of removal.",
      "The four migrants who brought the case now before the Supreme Court alleged that there are \"valid reasons to fear removal to specific countries\" that were not listed in their removal orders and said that their due process rights would be violated if the government did not provide them with notice and an opportunity to be heard before they were deported to a third country.",
      "The migrants first secured a temporary restraining order in late March, followed by the injunction in mid-April. The Trump administration appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, though it declined to immediately halt the district court's order.",
      "But as proceedings continued, lawyers told the court in a filing that migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared for removal to Libya, \"a country notorious for its human rights violations.\"",
      "Then, last week, immigration lawyers again told Murphy that they had received information that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam may have been boarded on a plane bound for South Sudan, in violation of his preliminary injunction. South Sudan has been engaged in a bloody civil war for more than a decade and the State Department has warned Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.\"",
      "On May 21, the Trump administration confirmed it had placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a removal flight to South Sudan. The judge then said that the government had \"unquestionably\" violated his order blocking deportations to third countries without providing migrants the chance to contest their removal and ordered the administration to give six deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews, with the opportunity to have a lawyer of their choosing present during the interview.",
      "Reasonable fear interviews typically assess whether a migrant can stay in the U.S. because of a risk of persecution or torture.",
      "The judge said the Department of Homeland Security could provide this process to six of the migrants either within the U.S. or abroad if the government \"retains custody and control\" over them.",
      "Following the judge's order, Mr. Trump confirmed that the migrant detainees were being held at a military base in Djibouti, a small African country.",
      "In his filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer lambasted the district court's orders, writing that \"the United States has been put to the intolerable choice of holding these aliens for additional proceedings at a military facility on foreign soil \u2014 where each day of their continued confinement risks grave harm to American foreign policy \u2014 or bringing these convicted criminals back to America.\"",

      "Truth Social doesn't release data about the size of its user base, but rival social media apps have typically recorded much higher sales growth, such as Reddit, which said its fourth-quarter ad sales jumped 60% to $394.5 million from a year earlier.",
      "Why is Trump Media venturing into financial services?",
      "Trump Media describes its new division, called Truth.Fi, as mixing financial services and financial technology.",
      "\"By expanding into this realm, we aim to serve millions of investors in America and around the world who believe in the greatness of the American economy and want to invest in superior companies while avoiding the giant, woke investment funds and politically motivated debanking problems,\" the company's May 9 regulatory filing said.",
      "\"Debanking\" is the term used by some conservative figures who have accused banks of barring them from opening accounts or blocking access to their assets because of their political views, prompting a Senate hearing in February over the issue. It's\u00a0also been the focus of some crypto investors, such as Nathan McCauley, who testified in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "Trump Media's crypto investment \"will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and U.S. firms, and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+,\" Nunes said in the statement.",

      "President Trump's decision to delay a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union led to a Wall Street rally on Tuesday, with the major indexes closing higher.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 119 points, or 2.1%, to close at 5,922 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 741 points, or 1.8%, to close at 42,344. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5%.",
      "Mr. Trump had initially threatened to impose a \"straight 50% Tariff\" on the trading bloc, effective June 1. The news, announced by the president in a Truth Social post Friday, sent stocks tumbling as investors braced for more uncertainty.",
      "But investors viewed the markets with more enthusiasm on Tuesday following an announcement from Mr. Trump over the holiday weekend that he would\u00a0delay the implementation of EU tariffs, from June 1 to July 9.",
      "Analysts noted that the stop-and-go nature of the president's tariff policies have been a key driver of market volatility in recent weeks, with stock movements hinging upon news of potential trade deals. All the while, experts say that the president's moves could be part of his overall strategy to broker new deals.",
      "\"With the Europe tariff threat removed, at least for now, markets got more evidence that tariffs are largely a negotiation tool,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The administration has been working to strike trade agreements before July 9, when the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs\u00a0is set to end. The president announced broad terms of a trade deal with\u00a0with the United Kingdom earlier this month, followed by a tariff truce with China.",
      "Maros Sefcovic, chief trade negotiator for the EU, said Monday, following calls with top U.S. officials, that the bloc was \"fully committed\" to reaching an agreement with the U.S. by the July deadline.",
      "European stocks were also up amid news of the U.S.-EU trade talk progress, while Asian indexes were mixed.",
      "Rise in consumer sentiment",
      "A partial rebound in consumer confidence added to Tuesday's positivity. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, released Tuesday morning, found consumer confidence rose 12.3 points to reach 98.0, up from 85.7 in April. The upswing follows month of decline in the index, triggered by fears of inflation and tariff-induced economic uncertainty. Analysts, however, warned the positive turnaround may be short-lived.",
      "\"Consumer confidence in May rebounded after trade tensions eased, but this may only be temporary,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in a research note.",
      "The bond market remained steady after easing slightly on Friday, after concerns earlier in the week over the nation's debt led to an uptick in Treasury Yields. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury were at 4.5% as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Still, this moment of calm may also be temporary, some economists say. In a research note on Tuesday, UBS analysts said investors should brace for more volatility in the bond market, as Mr. Trump's budget bill still\u00a0awaits approval from the Senate.",

      "Without naming the student, Mr. Trump took to Truth Social on Tuesday, advising that federal funding \"will be held back, maybe permanently,\" if state and local authorities don't do as he says. The president\u00a0signed an executive order\u00a0in February banning transgender girls and women from competing on\u00a0sports teams\u00a0that match their gender identity, and stating that it's the policy of the U.S. to \"rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.\"",

The Governor, himself, said it is 'UNFAIR.' I will speak to him today to find out which way he wants to go??? In the meantime I am ordering local authorities, if necessary, to not allow the transitioned person to compete in the State Finals. This is a totally ridiculous situation!!!\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond with further details about the student or the president's intention to speak with Newsom.",
      "On Tuesday, the California Interscholastic Federation, which oversees student sports,\u00a0announced a \"decision to pilot an entry process\" for the upcoming 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships.",

      "Newsom's office called the pilot proposal a reasonable approach.",
      "\"CIF's proposed pilot is a reasonable, respectful way to navigate a complex issue without compromising competitive fairness \u2014 a model worth pursuing,\" said Izzy Gardon, director of communications for Newsom. \"The governor is encouraged by this thoughtful approach.\"",
      "AB Hernandez, a high school junior track and field athlete at Jurupa Valley High School, has received significant national attention after winning the long jump and triple jump at the CIF Southern Section Division III finals earlier this month, according to the posted results. Hernandez's participation has been met with backlash from conservative groups who say the high school junior shouldn't be competing on the girls' team.",
      "\"As previously stated, JUSD is required to follow both California law and CIF policy regarding school athletics,\" Jurupa Unified School District said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Both state law and CIF policy currently require that students be permitted to participate in athletic teams and competitions consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records. We remain committed to following the law as written and ensuring that all students are granted the rights afforded to them in a safe and welcoming environment.\"",
      "Keeping \"men out of women's sports\" was a frequent refrain for Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, something he's trying to follow through on in office.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education for \"discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women's sports\" in what Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged is a violation of Title IX. Bondi said when the lawsuit was filed that more suits against other states could come.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has said it plans to move forward with the transfer of land in Tonto National Forest to a company that will develop a copper mine.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away a challenge from Native Americans seeking to block a copper mining project on government-owned land in Arizona that will destroy a sacred site used to perform religious ceremonies.",
      "The court rejected an appeal from the nonprofit organization Apache Stronghold, which challenged the transfer of the site known as Oak Flat to the mining company Resolution Copper. In turning away the case, the high court left in place a lower court ruling that allowed the land, located in Tonto National Forest, to be transferred for the development of the copper mine.",
      "Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas dissented from the Supreme Court's denial of the appeal. Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in the court's consideration of the case.",
      "Gorsuch, joined by Thomas, called the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the challenge a \"grave mistake\" and said the lower court's decision is an \"outlier.\"",
      "\"While this court enjoys the power to choose which cases it will hear, its decision to shuffle this case off our docket without a full airing is a grievous mistake \u2014 one with consequences that threaten to reverberate for generations,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"Just imagine if the government sought to demolish a historic cathedral on so questionable a chain of legal reasoning. I have no doubt that we would find that case worth our time. Faced with the government's plan to destroy an ancient site of tribal worship, we owe the Apaches no less.\"",
      "The federal government had for more than a century recognized Oak Flat's significance and protected the land, as well as the Apaches' access to it. The site includes old-growth oak groves, sacred springs and burial locations, according to court filings, and the Apaches consider Oak Flat to be \"a unique dwelling place of spiritual beings called Ga'an.\"",
      "But that changed after a copper deposit was discovered under the site in 1995. Seeking to obtain the deposit, two mining companies, Rio Tinto and BHP, created a joint venture called Resolution Copper.",
      "From 2005 to 2013, Resolution Copper's backers in Congress introduced legislation to transfer Oak Flat to the company, though the efforts were not successful. Then, in 2014, a land-transfer bill was included in a must-pass defense package, which authorized the transfer of roughly 2,422 acres including Oak Flat to Resolution Copper in exchange for other parcels of land.",
      "The legislation revoked prior presidential orders that protected Oak Flat from mining and directed the secretary of Agriculture to prepare an environmental impact statement for the project. That environmental impact statement, published in January 2021, confirmed that the copper mine would \"directly and permanently\" damage Oak Flat. To extract the copper, the company plans to use a technique called panel carving, which Apache Stronghold said would turn the site into a crater that is roughly 1,000 feet deep and nearly two miles wide.",
      "While the original environmental impact statement was withdrawn shortly after it was issued, the Trump administration has said that it plans to publish a final version next month and move forward with the land transfer to Resolution Copper.",
      "In an attempt to stop the exchange and subsequent destruction of Oak Flat, Apache Stronghold, which represents members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, filed a lawsuit in 2021, arguing that the move violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "A federal district court declined to block the land transfer, and a divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ultimately rejected Apache Stronghold's challenge, finding that the copper mining project did not impose a substantial burden on the tribes' religious exercise.",
      "The Forest Service has estimated that the project will create 3,500 jobs and contribute $1.2 billion to Arizona's economy each year. But lawyers for the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which worships at the site, said in court papers that Oak Flat \"is central to traditional Apache religion as the home of Apache deities and the only place where Apaches can practice unique ceremonies.\"",
      "Vicky Peacey, general manager of Resolution Copper, said the mine is \"vital to securing America's energy future, infrastructure needs, and national defense with a domestic supply of copper and other critical minerals.\"",
      "\"More than a decade of extensive consultation and collaboration with Native American Tribes and local communities has directly led to major changes to the mining plan to preserve and reduce potential impacts on Tribal, social, and cultural interests, and this ongoing dialogue will continue to shape the project,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Wendsler Nosie Sr. of Apache Stronghold called the Supreme Court's decision a \"heavy blow\" and urged Congress to act to stop the land transfer.",
      "\"We will never stop fighting \u2014 nothing will deter us from protecting Oak Flat from destruction,\" he said in a statement.",

      "Investigators found 17 bodies in an abandoned house in a central Mexican region plagued by cartel violence, the state prosecutor's office said, just days after seven people, including chldren, were gunned down in the same region.",
      "Ground-penetrating radar and cadaver dogs were used to locate the bodies last week in Irapuato in Guanajuato state, according to a statement released late Monday.",
      "Knives, machetes, pickaxes, and shovels were also found.",
      "Five of the victims -- four men and one woman --- have been identified as missing persons, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"Their families are being informed,\" a Guanajuato state official, Jorge Jimenez, told reporters.",
      "Guanajuato is a thriving industrial hub and home to several popular tourist destinations, but it is also Mexico's deadliest state, according to official homicide statistics.",
      "The violent crime is linked to conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in the Latin American nation. The cartel is one of several that has been designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administrarion.",
      "Guanajuato recorded the most homicides of any state in Mexico last year, with 3,151, 10.5% of murders nationwide, according to official figures.",
      "Civil society groups formed by relatives who denounce government inaction risk their own lives searching for remains in unmarked graves, often in areas where cartel gunmen are active.",

      "Innocent bystanders and police officers are often casualties amid cartel turf wars in Guanajuato.",

Messages are\u00a0often left on victims' bodies\u00a0by cartels seeking to threaten their rivals or punish behavior they claim violates their rules.",
      "In February, five women and three men were\u00a0shot dead\u00a0in the street in Guanajuato. The month before that, security forces clashed with gunmen in the state, leaving\u00a010 suspected criminals dead\u00a0and three police officers injured.",

The state prosecutor's office also said the perpetrators left messages in which a cartel claimed responsibility.",
      "The bodies were found less than 24 hours after\u00a0gunmen attacked a residential center\u00a0for people suffering from addictions in the same municipality, killing four people.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-israel-backed-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-aid-effort-tumultuous-start/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 20:15:38 -0400",
    "summary": "A U.S. and Israeli-backed humanitarian aid effort for Gaza says it's started distributing desperately needed food. The U.N. calls it a \"distraction from what is actually needed.\"",
    "story": [
      "A controversial new U.S. and Israel-backed aid group says it began operating in the war-torn Gaza Strip on Monday, despite objections from the United Nations, other humanitarian groups, and the recent, sudden resignation of its American executive director, who said it couldn't operate independently. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it opened its first aid distribution hubs in the enclave on Monday and that truckloads of food had been delivered.",
      "The GHF said in a statement that about 8,000 food boxes had been distributed by Tuesday afternoon, each one containing enough to feed \"5.5 people for 3.5 days, totaling 462,000 meals.\"",
      "\"More trucks with aid will be delivered tomorrow, with the flow of aid increasing each day,\" GHF said in a statement.",
      "There were unconfirmed reports by Israeli and Palestinian media outlets that one of the aid hubs was abandoned by the security personnel in charge of securing the operation after thousands of people clambering for food overran the location. The Israel Hayom newspaper said the security forces withdrew to helicopters amid gunfire.",
      "In a statement, the GHF said there was a \"moment in the late afternoon\" at one of its Secure Distribution Sites when the number of people seeking aid \"was such that the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely and dissipate. This was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties. Normal operations have resumed.\"",
      "The group said some Palestinians endured \"several hour delays in accessing the site due to blockades imposed by Hamas.\"",
      "In a separate statement, the Israeli military said troops had \"fired warning shots in the area outside the compound. Control over the situation was established, food distribution operations are expected to continue as planned, and the safety of IDF troops was not compromised.\"",
      "The GHF \u2014 the leadership and funding of which have remained unclear \u2014 was created as Israel and its closest ally, the U.S., faced a growing outcry over Palestinians in Gaza starving amid Israel's nearly three-month blockade of the territory. Under intense pressure from the international community, Israel began letting some food into Gaza last week, but aid organizations have called it a \"drop in the bucket\" given the level of need.",
      "\"As part of the gradual opening of the distribution centers, two of the centers, located in Tel al-Sultan and the Morag Corridor in the Rafah area, began operating today (Tuesday) and are distributing food packages to thousands of families in the Gaza Strip,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. \"The establishment of the distribution centers took place over the last few months, facilitated by the Israeli political echelon and in coordination with the US government. This process coincided with an ongoing dialogue and cooperation with the IDF.\"",
      "The IDF said the new aid system was \"operated by International Aid Organizations, and Secured by an American Civilian Security Company,\" but neither the military nor the GHF itself has named any global non-profit organizations involved in the effort, and it was unclear what security firm from the U.S. was helping secure the hubs.",
      "U.N. calls new aid operation a \"distraction\"",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the United Nations humanitarian office called the work of GHF a \"distraction from what is actually needed,\" which the spokesperson said was the reopening of crossings into Gaza and the end of Israeli restrictions on the kind of aid entering the territory.",
      "The GHF has been tasked by Israel with taking over the handling of aid in Gaza despite objections from the U.N., which, along with other aid groups, has pushed back against the new system. They assert that Israel is trying to use food as a weapon and say a new system won't be effective.",
      "Israel has pushed for an alternative aid delivery plan because it says it must stop Hamas from seizing aid. The U.N. has denied that Hamas has diverted large amounts of aid. Hamas, long designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, also denies the allegations.",
      "The GHF began operations just a day after its executive director, American Jake Wood, announced his resignation and said it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. GHF said it had appointed an interim leader, John Acree, to replace Wood.",
      "The organization, said to be made up of former humanitarian, government and military officials, has said its distribution points will provide aid for a million Palestinians \u2014 around half of Gaza's population \u2014 by the end of the week.",
      "Under pressure from allies, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid into Gaza last week after blocking all food, medicine, fuel or other goods from entering since early March. Aid groups had issued multiple warnings of a looming famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas tells Palestinians not to use new aid system",

    "summary": "King Charles III addressed Canada's Parliament on Tuesday in a rare gesture that comes as Canada grapples with President Trump's tariffs and annexation threats.",
    "story": [
      "King Charles III spoke of a \"critical moment\" for Canada Tuesday as he addressed the Canadian Parliament in a rare gesture that comes as Canada grapples with tariffs and annexation threats by President Trump.",
      "\"The True North is indeed strong and free,\" Charles said, nodding to the Canadian national anthem.",
      "The British monarch, who formally serves as Canada's head of state, arrived in the capital of Ottawa on Monday, part of a two-day visit that's widely viewed as a form of pushback against Mr. Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Why did King Charles speak to Canada's parliament?",
      "The king delivered a \"Speech from the Throne,\" which marked the start of a new session of Parliament after the center-left Liberal Party won last month's federal election. The speech \u2014 written by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's office, not the king \u2014 outlined the new government's agenda and priorities, while acknowledging the political and economic dynamics on the world stage affecting the country.",
      "Marking the start of Parliament with a speech is a longstanding tradition in Canada and other former parts of the British Empire \u2014 but it's highly unusual for the king to deliver the speech himself. Instead, the king's representative in Canada, the governor-general, normally speaks on his behalf. The last time the monarch personally gave the speech was in 1977, when Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0traveled to Canada's capital for the event.",
      "In his address, the king cited his mother's visit to Canada to open its parliament in 1957, saying that the visit came as \"the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory,\" as the Cold War intensified, and \"freedom and democracy were under threat.\" Canada was \"emerging as a growing economic power and a force for peace in the world,\" he added, comparing the moment to the challenges of the present.",
      "\"Today, Canada faces another critical moment,\" Charles said, adding that \"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect.\"",
      "Is King Charles' visit to Ottawa related to Trump?",
      "Some watchers of Canadian politics said so ahead of the visit, especially as Mr. Trump has repeatedly mused about the United States annexing Canada, stirring strong backlash.",
      "Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta, says the royal visit could be \"an indication that the king takes Canada's sovereignty seriously.\"",
      "\"The explicit threats to Canada's sovereignty probably got the attention of the king and his advisers,\" Wesley told CBS News.",
      "The visit could also play to domestic politics, Wesley says. Mr. Trump's comments have \"stirred up patriotism in some odd corners of Canada,\" and the country's status as a constitutional monarchy where the king is still technically the head of state is one major difference between Canada and its neighbor to the south. And even though most Canadians are fairly indifferent toward the monarchy, visits by royals always draw interest.",
      "\"It's seen as a point of pride and distinction between Canada and the U.S.,\" said Wesley, who previously served in several roles for Alberta's provincial government.",
      "University of Toronto political science professor Elizabeth McCallion said the visit is likely intended as a \"reminder that we are an independent country\" and a \"rallying together of Canadians.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Carney told Sky News the invitation to Charles was \"not coincidental.\" In a statement welcoming Charles on Monday, the prime minister didn't mention Mr. Trump, but did hint at Canada's \"distinct identity\" and \"historic ties that crises only fortify.\"",
      "Charles also has a longstanding relationship with Canada, visiting the country over a dozen times before ascending to the throne. Amid a rocky relationship with the United States, many Canadians have looked for signs of support from Charles, taking note of symbolic gestures like the crown's decision to plant a maple tree at Buckingham Palace earlier this year, McCallion said.",
      "McCallion says some Canadians also believe Mr. Trump's longstanding fascination with the British royal family could play to the country's benefit.",
      "\"There's hope that when he's visiting, Trump will take notice and respect the fact that Canada has connections to the British monarchy,\" McCallion told CBS News.",
      "Charles is the head of state for both Canada and the U.K., putting him in an unusual position as the U.K. seeks a stronger trade relationship with the Trump administration. Earlier this month, Carney criticized the U.K. government for inviting Mr. Trump to a state visit earlier this year, presenting Mr. Trump with an invitation from the king. The Canadian leader told Sky News most Canadians \"weren't impressed by that gesture.\"",
      "What did King Charles say in the speech about the U.S. and Trump?",
      "The king alluded to the relationship between Canada and the U.S. throughout his speech, as he addressed changes to the global trade systems. Charles said open global trade, while \"not perfect,\" has \"helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades.\"",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about a drastically changing world around them,\" Charles said. \"Yet this moment is also an incredible opportunity \u2014 an opportunity for renewal. An opportunity to think big and to act bigger. An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War.\"",
      "The king emphasized that a \"confident Canada\" can \"seize this opportunity by recognizing that all Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away.\" He added that by staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians.",
      "The king made only a passing reference to Mr. Trump, saying Canada's prime minister and the U.S. president \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship\" that he said was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "What has Trump said about Canada \u2014 and how has Carney responded?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated annexing Canada in recent months, rattling Canadian politics.",
      "The 51st-state jabs sometimes appear tongue-in-cheek: Mr. Trump referred to Carney's predecessor \u2014 who stepped down as prime minister ahead of new elections this year \u2014 as \"Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada.\" In other cases, Mr. Trump has cast absorbing Canada as a tidy way of resolving the U.S.'s trade deficit with its northern neighbor.",
      "But Trudeau has reportedly called Mr. Trump's talk of absorbing Canada \"a real thing,\" telling business and labor leaders in a private meeting that he sees taking over Canada as a way of getting access to the country's mineral wealth, according to the public broadcaster CBC. Many Canadian voters hold the same view, according to McCallion.",
      "\"I think maybe the first or second time, people were offended but thought he was kidding. And at this point, certainly no Canadians think he's kidding,\" McCallion said. \"Most Canadians are taking it as a serious threat.\"",
      "When asked whether he would use military force to take over Canada, Mr. Trump said earlier this month, \"I don't see it.\" But in a White House meeting with Carney days later, the U.S. leader still called the idea of annexing Canada a \"wonderful marriage\" that would deliver \"tremendous\" benefits to Canada, and referred to the border between the two countries as \"artificial.\"",
      "Carney said in the meeting Canada \"won't be for sale, ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on many Canadian goods, leading Canada to hit the U.S. with retaliatory levies.",
      "Last month's Canadian elections were dominated by Mr. Trump's tariffs and annexation comments, and the race was widely seen as a referendum on who Canadians trusted more to deal with the Trump administration.",
      "Carney's Liberal Party \u2014 which has held power for almost a decade \u2014 previously trailed the Conservatives in polling, but its fortunes rebounded after Mr. Trump's jabs at Canada. In a victory speech, Carney said the country's \"old relationship with the United States \u2026 is over,\" and argued Mr. Trump is \"trying to break us so that America can own us.\"",
      "\"Our national identity is at times muddied because it's made up of so many different cultures that have come together,\" McCallion told CBS News. \"Often, Canadians primarily express their national identity as not being American.\"",

      "The three sites in the city of Luxor date to the New Kingdom era, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said on social media, which ranged from about 1550 to 1070 B.C.",
      "One of the tombs is for a person called \"Amon-am-Ebt,\" who worked in a temple or other sacred site. The tomb has a view of sacrificial items and other relics, the ministry said. The tomb includes a small courtyard, an entrance, and a square hall. That site was later reused, and another hall was built, the ministry said.",
      "Another tomb is for a person called \"Baki,\" who was a supervisor at a nearby monastery. The tomb included multiple courtyards and an exhibition hall.",
      "The third tomb, which included a small courtyard and its own exhibition hall, was for a person identified as \"S,\" who worked as an overseer at a nearby temple, and was also a mayor and writer, the ministry said.",
      "Further research will be done to learn more about the tombs, their occupants and their construction, the ministry said.",
      "The tombs were found in the Dra Abu al-Naga necropolis in Luxor.",
      "In late 2024, Egyptian officials announced the discovery of an ancient tomb with 11 sealed coffins, and a trove of jewelry, near Luxor. The site was likely a family tomb, CBS News previously reported. In 2023, researchers found what is believed to be the first burial site in the city.",
      "Overall, more than a thousand burial sites have been found in Luxor, Fathy Yaseen, director general of antiquities of Upper Egypt, told CBS News in 2023.",

    "summary": "Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh was taken captive after his F-16 fighter jet crashed in northern Syria.",
    "story": [
      "A Swedish man was indicted Tuesday in connection with ISIS' killing of a Jordanian pilot whose plane went down in Syria on Christmas Eve 2014, prosecutors said.",
      "The 26-year-old Jordanian, 1st Lt. Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, was taken captive after his F-16 fighter jet crashed near the extremists' de facto capital of Raqqa in northern Syria. He was forced into a cage that was set on fire, killing him on camera in early 2015.",
      "The suspect was identified by Swedish prosecutors as Osama Krayem, 32, who is alleged to have traveled to Syria in September 2014 to fight for ISIS.",
      "The airman became the first known foreign military pilot to fall into the militants' hands after the U.S.-led international coalition began its aerial campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq in 2014. Jordan, a close U.S. ally, was a member of the coalition and the pilot's killing appeared aimed at pressuring the government of Jordan to leave the alliance.",
      "Krayem was charged with \"participating in the brutal execution of a pilot\" near Raqqa, prosecutor Reena Devgun told a press conference.",
      "Krayem is set to go on trial June 4 in Stockholm. He was previously convicted in France and Brussels for fatal ISIS attacks in those countries.",
      "Video of the killing",
      "In a 20-minute video released in 2015, purportedly showing al-Kaseasbeh's killing, he displayed signs of having been beaten, including a black eye.",
      "In the video, the victim is seen walking past several masked ISIS fighters, including Krayem, according to prosecutors.",
      "The pilot is then locked in a cage that is set on fire, leading to his death, Henrik Olin, the other prosecutor in charge of the case, told reporters.",
      "\"This bestial murder, in which a prisoner was burned alive in a cage, was staged in a carefully produced video that was broadcast around the world. Its publication marked an unprecedented escalation in the Islamic State group's violent propaganda,\" Olin said.",
      "Prosecutors have been unable to determine the exact day of the murder, but the investigation has identified the location where it took place.",
      "The footage was widely released as part of the militant group's propaganda.",
      "The killing sparked outrage and anti-ISIS demonstrations in Jordan, and King Abdullah II ordered two al Qaeda prisoners to be executed in response.",
      "In 2022, Krayem was among 20 men convicted by a special terrorism court in Paris for involvement in a wave of ISIS attacks in the French capital in 2015, targeting the Bataclan theater, Paris caf\u00e9s and the national stadium. The assaults killed 130 people and injured hundreds, some permanently maimed.",
      "Krayem was sentenced to 30 years in prison, for charges including complicity to terrorist murder. French media reported that France agreed in March to turn Krayem over to Sweden for nine months, to assist with the Swedish probe and his expected trial.",
      "Sweden is then to return him to France so he can serve out his sentence, French media reported.",
      "In 2023, a Belgian court sentenced Krayem, among others, to life in prison on charges of terrorist murder in connection with 2016 suicide bombings that killed 32 people and wounded hundreds at Brussels' airport and a busy subway station, the country's deadliest peacetime attack.",
      "Krayem was aboard the commuter train that was hit, but did not detonate the explosives he was carrying.",
      "Both the Paris and Brussels attacks were linked to the same ISIS network.",
      "\"It is painful for my parents to be confronted with this event again, but we are grateful that the Swedish authorities want to give us justice,\" Jawdat al-Kasasbeh, the pilot's brother, told broadcaster Sveriges Radio.",
      "Life in Sweden",
      "Krayem grew up in Rosengard, a district notorious in Sweden for high crime and unemployment rates where more than 80% of the residents are first- or second-generation immigrants.",
      "\"He was well-known to the local police for multiple criminal activities like thefts, for instance,\" Muhammad Khorshid, who ran a program in Rosengard to help immigrants integrate into Swedish society, told The Associated Press in 2016.",
      "He said Krayem \"was the perfect target for radicalization \u2014 no job, no future, no money.\"",
      "Krayem had posted photos on social media from Syria, including one where he posed with an assault rifle in front of the black flag of ISIS.",
      "Lost territory",
      "At its peak, ISIS ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom in Iraq and Syria and was notorious for its brutality \u2014 much of it directed against fellow Sunni Muslims as well as against those the group deemed to be heretics. It beheaded civilians, slaughtered 1,700 captured Iraqi soldiers in a short period, and enslaved and raped thousands of women from the Yazidi community, one of Iraq's oldest religious minorities.",
      "In March 2019, the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the the last sliver of land the extremists controlled in the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz. While ISIS has lost its hold on all of the territory it once controlled, sleeper cells still stage occasional attacks in Iraq and Syria and abroad.",
      "Arrest in Germany",
      "Also on Tuesday, the German federal prosecutor separately announced the arrest of an alleged member of the Syrian secret intelligence services under former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The suspect, who was only named as Fahad A. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested on suspicion of acts of killing, torture and deprivation of liberty as crimes against humanity.",
      "He allegedly took part in more than 100 interrogations between late April 2011 and mid-April 2012. At least 70 prisoners died from the torture and prison conditions, the federal prosecutor's office said.",

    "story": [
      "A 1,500-year-old bucket discovered in England has been identified as an ancient cremation burial vessel, experts said.",
      "The 6th-century bucket was found at Sutton Hoo, an archaeological site near Suffolk, England, that is home to two ancient cemeteries. Fragments of the bucket, named the Bromeswell bucket, were first found in 1986. Researchers found more pieces of the relic last year during an excavation by Time Team, a British TV show where archaeologists conduct excavations on-camera.",
      "An analysis of the newly-discovered pieces determined that Time Team had found the entire base of the bucket, and that it contained human bone fragments, the National Trust, a U.K.-based conservation organization, said in a news release. The bones included part of an ankle bone and fragments of a skull, which the National Trust said was proof of an \"early Anglo-Saxon cremation burial.\"",
      "Angus Wainwright, a National Trust archaeologist, said in the news release that the burial appeared to be \"very special,\" and that researchers will conduct further analysis.",
      "There were also animal bones inside the bucket, which is made of copper alloy and is decorated with a hunting scene. The National Trust said the bones were larger than those of a pig, and noted that horses were often included on funeral pyres as a symbol of status during this time. The bones will undergo radiocarbon dating, the National Trust said.",
      "\"We knew that this bucket would have been a rare and prized possession back in Anglo-Saxon times, but it's always been a mystery why it was buried,\" Wainwright said. \"Now we know it was used to contain the remains of an important person in the Sutton Hoo community.\"",
      "The bucket was made in the Byzantine Empire and may have been a diplomatic gift or acquired by a mercenary Saxon soldier, the National Trust said. The vessel is decorated with a scene of men armed with swords and shields. The scene also includes lions and dogs. The newest fragments help complete the picture, showing feet, paws, the base of shields and the face of one hunting man.",
      "Also inside the bucket was a double-sided comb that the National Trust said was likely made from antler. The agency said its researchers hope ancient DNA can be recovered from the object. The item was not burned in the cremation process, the National Trust noted. The inclusion of such combs in other burial sites suggest that \"personal appearance and grooming was important to the Anglo-Saxons.\" The comb could also have been used to control lice, the trust said.",
      "Plant remains were found during the excavation of the bucket pieces. Analysis of those pieces could \"reveal more about the climate and seasonality around the time the bucket was buried,\" the National Trust said.",
      "Time Team aired a documentary about the discovery and year-long analysis project earlier in May. The group will conduct more research at Sutton Hoo through mid-June.",

      "At the same time, sales of battery-electric vehicles by all manufacturers rose about 28%, the group's data shows.",
      "The numbers are the latest indication of how much the Tesla brand is suffering because of the backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk over his far-right views. Crowds have gathered at Tesla dealerships in both Europe and the U.S., with protesters objecting to Musk's work with President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed the U.S. federal workforce and been the subject of multiple lawsuits.",

      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A 19-year-old New Zealand man has died after taking part in a new tackling game that's trending on social media  in which competitors run at each other and collide while wearing no protective equipment. Police confirmed Ryan Satterthwaite suffered a head injury on Sunday while playing a backyard game with friends in the North Island city of Palmerston North. He died on Monday as a result of his injuries.",
      "Area police commander Inspector Ross Grantham described Satterthwaite's death as \"a huge tragedy\" and urged others to \"consider the significant safety and injury risks\" of the game that is known as RUNIT or RUNIT Straight.",
      "\"A young man lost his life as a result of participating in what I understand to be a social media frenzy,\" Grantham said. \"While this is not a criminal matter, police will continue to undertake inquiries on behalf of the coroner.\"",
      "Grantham said \"the tackle game played by the group of friends was based on a social media-driven trend where participants compete in full-contact collisions without protective gear.",
      "\"While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity.\"",
      "RUNIT is based loosely on the contact elements of rugby union, rugby league or the NFL and involves two competitors, a runner and a tackler, running at each other and colliding on a 65 foot by 13 foot area known as a battlefield.",
      "The game has grown in social media popularity through the Australian RUNIT Championship League, which offers cash prizes to competitors. Organizers promote the event as \"the world's fiercest new collision sport.\"",
      "Two trial events in Auckland in recent weeks saw eight men compete for 20,000 New Zealand dollars ($12,000) in front of more than 1,000 spectators. Winners were expected to go into a championship event next month with prize money of up to 250,000 New Zealand dollars ($150,000).",
      "Two other events in Auckland were canceled when organizers were unable to obtain permits.",
      "The RUNIT Championship League released a statement to the New Zealand news website Stuff on Tuesday, saying it \"does not encourage any copying of the sport as it should only be done under the strict conditions.\"",
      "\"This is tragic news and our hearts go out to the family and friends of Ryan. Any contact sport like boxing, martial arts or combat-style activities should only be held in highly controlled environments which include professional medical supervision and support.\"",
      "RUNIT has been strongly condemned by experts in head injuries who say competitors run a high risk of a serious brain injury.",
      "It is by no means the first social media-fueled trend to draw safety warnings after a tragedy.

    "summary": "Ukraine says Russia launched its biggest drone strike to date after Trump called Putin crazy for stepping up his offensive and \"needlessly killing a lot of people.\"",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv, Ukraine\u00a0\u2014 Russia launched its biggest drone attack on Ukraine overnight since the more than three-year war began, a Ukrainian official said Monday. President Trump said Russian leader Vladimir Putin had gone \"absolutely crazy\" in stepping up his country's bombing of Ukraine just as the U.S. tries to broker a peace agreement.",
      "Russia's Sunday night attack included the launch of 355 drones, Yuriy Ihnat, head of the Ukrainian air force's communications department, told The Associated Press. The previous night, Russia fired 298 drones and 69 missiles of various types in what Ukrainian authorities said was the largest combined aerial assault during the conflict. Overall, from Friday to Sunday, Russia launched around 900 drones at Ukraine, officials said.",
      "The escalation appeared to thwart hopes that Mr. Trump's peace efforts might lead to a breakthrough in the near term, as Putin looks determined to capture more Ukrainian territory and inflict more damage.",
      "Russia has this month broken its record for aerial bombardments of Ukraine three times. The expansion of its air campaign came after Kyiv in March accepted an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S., but Moscow effectively rejected it. Russia is also still pushing along the roughly 620-mile front line, where it has made slow and costly progress, and is assembling its forces for a summer offensive, Ukraine and military analysts say.",
      "Mr. Trump made it clear he is losing patience with Putin.",
      "\"I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!\" the U.S. president wrote Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Putin is \"needlessly killing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said, pointing out that \"missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever.\"",
      "He warned that if Putin wants to conquer all of Ukraine, it will \"lead to the downfall of Russia!\"",
      "But Mr. Trump again expressed frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, too, saying that he's, \"doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does.\"",
      "Zelenskyy reacted to the overnight Russian strikes in his own social media post on Monday, saying: \"Only a sense of complete impunity can allow Russia to carry out such attacks and continually escalate their scale. ... There is no significant military logic to this, but there is considerable political meaning.\"",
      "He repeated his call for tighter international economic sanctions on Russia as a way of ending the war, because Russia's \"desire to fight must be deprived of resources.\"",
      "Russia and Europe react to Trump's remarks on Putin",
      "The Russian government appeared to downplay Mr. Trump's remarks about Putin as an emotional outburst, however some European leaders, who have been frustrated for months by the U.S. president repeating Kremlin talking points about the war and ridiculing Zelenskyy's government, seemed to take some hope by the change in tack.",
      "At the Kremlin, Putin's chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that, \"the start of the negotiation process [with Ukraine], for which the American side has done a lot, is a very important achievement. We are very thankful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for assistance in organizing and launching this negotiation process. This is a very important achievement. \u2026 Of course, at the same time this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone, absolutely, and with emotional reactions. We follow this very closely.\"",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, however, told reporters during a visit to Vietnam that it seemed Mr. Trump appeared to be realizing that Putin had \"lied\" to him about wanting to find a diplomatic resolution to the war. The French leader said his hope was that Mr. Trump's anger at Moscow \"translates into action,\" and he called for Ukraine's international partners to set a firm deadline for Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, with the threat of \"massive sanctions\" should Putin continue to refuse.",
      "Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, meanwhile, told his country's broadcaster WDR that \"Putin obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,\" stressing the Kremlin's rejection of proposed direct talks with Ukraine at the Vatican as evidence that \"we must be prepared for this war to last longer than we all wish or can imagine.\"",
      "Merz said several of Ukraine's partners had already dropped restrictions on allowing their military aid to be used for strikes deep inside Russia.",
      "\"There are no longer any range restrictions on the weapons delivered to Ukraine. Not from the British, nor the French, nor from us \u2026 and not from the Americans either,\" Merz said Monday. \"This means Ukraine can now also defend itself by attacking military targets in Russia. For a long time, it couldn't do that, and with a few exceptions, it didn't. We call this long-range fire, meaning equipping Ukraine in such a way that it can also strike military targets in the hinterland \u2014 and that is the decisive, qualitative difference in Ukraine's warfare: Russia is attacking civilian cities without any regard, bombing cities, hospitals, and nursing homes. Ukraine does not do that.\"",
      "The European Union's top diplomat, foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, earlier described the latest attacks on Kyiv as \"totally appalling\" and said the bloc intended to impose more sanctions on Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened massive sanctions on Moscow, too, but so far hasn't taken action.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin makes decisions that are necessary to ensure Russia's security and that the attacks were Moscow's response to deep strikes by Ukraine.",
      "Prisoner swap provides a solitary sign of progress",
      "Russia and Ukraine swapped hundreds more prisoners Sunday in the third and last part of a major exchange that was a rare moment of cooperation between the warring nations.",

      "Billy Joel performs at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 19, 2023, in New York City. Following his diagnosis of a brain condition, Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts. (Getty Images)",
      "\"The fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid, is constantly produced in fluid-filled spaces in the center of the brain called ventricles,\" Matthew Potts, M.D., a Northwestern Medicine neurosurgeon, told Fox News Digital. (He is not involved in Joel's care.)",
      "\"It flows through the ventricles and then around the surface of the brain and spinal cord, where it is then reabsorbed.\"",
      "Hydrocephalus can happen for a variety of reasons, including infection, trauma to the brain or bleeding within the brain, the doctor said.",
      "\"This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"",
      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a version of the condition that is typically seen in older people, where the cerebrospinal fluid builds up without increasing the pressure in the brain.",
      "Despite the fact that pressure remains normal, NPH can impact brain function, particularly the areas of thinking, memory, movement and focus, according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Symptoms of NPH",
      "The three main effects of NPH are gait issues, urinary incontinence and cognitive difficulties. Collectively, these symptoms are known as \"Hakim\u2019s triad.\"",
      "The cognitive problems can include memory loss, slow thinking and difficulty, according to Mia Kazanjian, M.D., a board-certified radiologist in private practice based in Connecticut.",
      "The five-time Grammy winner, 76, announced on Friday that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside or around the brain. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images)",
      "\"This can negatively impact someone\u2019s career and personal life, limiting the ability to do activities of daily living like eating, bathing and dressing,\" Kazanjian told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\"This can also lead to emotional changes, like depression.\"",
      "Urinary incontinence means loss of bladder control, which can cause discomfort, anxiety and embarrassment, according to the doctor.",
      "\"This can predispose someone to bladder infection and skin irritation,\" she cautioned.",
      "MINI-STROKES MAY CAUSE SURPRISING LONG-TERM HEALTH ISSUE, EXPERTS WARN",
      "\"If someone has to get up in the middle of the night due to this, he or she is more likely to fall. Furthermore, it can lead someone to isolate socially, which can lead to feelings of loneliness.\"",
      "Gait impairment means the person\u2019s steps are unsteady, there is loss of balance, and the feet can stick to the ground, shuffle or freeze, Kazanjian said.",
      "\"The danger is that someone can fall and sustain trauma with a significant injury,\" she said.",

      "Other factors, such as race, gender or ethnicity, do not appear to impact the chances of the condition occurring.",

      "The condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans). (iStock)",
      "Only some 0.003% of people under 65 will get the condition.",

      "Diagnosis and treatment",
      "The condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans).",
      "The most common treatment for NPH is a surgical procedure called \"shunting,\" in which a device with two tubes, called a shunt, is implanted to regulate the amount of fluid in the brain.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"One end is placed into a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid, usually in the ventricle in the brain or a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid in the lumbar spine below the spinal cord,\" Potts told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The other end goes somewhere else in the body that can reabsorb the fluid, usually in the abdomen.\"",
      "The only known risk factor for NPH is age, with the average age of onset around 70.",
      "\"Shunts are more complex than just a tube \u2014 there is often a valve that regulates how much fluid can flow through it.\"",
      "Some newer shunts can be programmed to change the rate of fluid flow from outside the body, Potts added.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",
      "Symptoms typically improve within hours or days of the shunt being implanted. The surgery itself usually entails days or weeks of recovery.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has cut all ties with Harvard University over its failure to adequately address antisemitism and discrimination. Here is a look back at the findings of Harvard&apos;s own report.",
    "story": [
      "Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley discusses the latest escalation in President Donald Trump's feud with Harvard",
      "The Trump administration escalated its war with Harvard University on Tuesday, announcing it will claw back the university's remaining $100 million in federal funding \u2014 effectively ending all financial ties with the Ivy League institution.",
      "\"The government is out of business with Harvard University, fully,\" a senior administration official told Fox News Digital.",
      "At the center of the fight are accusations of Harvard failing to combat a campus culture of antisemitism. While the university accuses the White House of overreach and insists it is defending free speech, its own internal investigation appears to have handed Trump officials ammunition.",
      "Earlier this year, Harvard President Alan Gerber called the 2023\u20132024 academic year \"disappointing and painful\" as he unveiled the results of two separate task forces: one examining antisemitism and the other focused on anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias.",
      "The report from the antisemitism task force painted a bleak picture of life for Jewish and Israeli students on campus.",
      "Many said they felt ostracized, harassed online and unsupported by the university. Some students told investigators they had been pressured by peers, and even the faculty, to disavow ties to Israel to prove they were \"one of the good ones.\" Others chose to hide their Jewish identity altogether.",
      "Here is a look back at more findings of the report, released April 29.",
      "1. Hostile environment for Jewish students",
      "Jewish, Arab and Muslim students at Harvard reported feeling ostracized, pushed to the margins by their peers and experiencing online harassment.",
      "Jewish and Israeli students told the antisemitism task force the university\u2019s response to complaints was \"unclear and unconscionably slow.\"",
      "Some Jewish students, according to the report, had been told by peers and even faculty members they were associated with \"something offensive, and, in some cases, that their very presence was an offense.\"",
      "Some decided to conceal their identities from classmates, while others were asked to renounce any ties to Israel to prove they were \"one of the good ones.\"",
      "TRUMP SAYS HARVARD'S FOREIGN STUDENTS ARE FROM COUNTRIES PAYING 'NOTHING' FOR THEIR EDUCATION",
      "\"No other group was constantly told that their history was a sham, that they or their co-religionists or co-ethnics were supremacists and oppressors, and that they had no right to the protections offered by anti-bias norms,\" read one section of the report. \"Many Jewish students told us they feel like objects of suspicion.\"",

      "One Jewish graduate student told the task force, \"Jews are now being treated like Republicans were when I was in college.\"",
      "That statement \"of course points to another problem with which elite universities have been struggling,\" the report said.",
      "At times, the anti-Muslim and antisemitism task force reports were seemingly at odds with each other. Muslim and pro-Palestinian students reported a widespread fear of doxxing, or having their personal identifying information shared publicly with the intent to intimidate or harm them. They reported often seeing pictures of their faces on the sides of trucks driven around campus by pro-Israel groups.",
      "Forty-seven percent of Muslim students reported feeling physically unsafe on campus during the 2023\u20132024 school year, compared with 15% of Jewish respondents.",
      "The antisemitism report called for a set of rules to govern permissible behaviors for instructors in classrooms, while the anti-Muslim and Arab bias task force called for the university to do more to protect academic freedom and free speech.",
      "JUDGE TEMPORARILY PAUSES TRUMP MOVE TO CANCEL HARVARD STUDENT VISA POLICY AFTER LAWSUIT",
      "2. Academic biases",
      "The antisemitism report found\u00a0Harvard classes often portrayed \"partisan and one-sided pedagogy\" that failed to account for Jewish and Israeli perspectives, particularly within the university's divinity school and school of public health.",
      "The task force also documented instances when faculty canceled or ended class early on the day of a pro-Gaza protest or\u00a0\"gave time at the end of class for students to promote various solidarity groups\" like the Palestine Solidarity Committee.",
      "The report recommended expanding courses on antisemitism, Judaism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to foster a more inclusive and comprehensive academic environment.",
      "\"Anti-Zionist views seem built into some classes,\" one student noted.",
      "Fox News Digital has reached out to Harvard for comment on the report.",
      "3. Political divides worsening",
      "In the 1980s and 1990s, the report found that at the university \"pro-Israel organizers and pro-Palestinian organizers had disagreed strongly yet often worked together to build bridges and to imagine jointly a better future for the region.\"",
      "\"Those efforts started to fade in the 2000s amidst the Second Intifada and through the Israel-Hamas wars of the 2010s, and by the time Hamas crashed through the Israeli border fence in 2023 the conditions at Harvard (as in the Middle East itself) were very different,\" the report read.",
      "Some pro-Palestinian campus organizers viewed bridge-building activities \"as a form of betrayal,\" the report found.",
      "Some pro-Palestinian campus organizers viewed bridge-building activities \"as a form of betrayal,\" the report found. (Anibal Martel/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The report found that many students, including Jewish ones, had \"sympathy\" for Israel\u2019s \"massive military response\" that followed the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.",
      "However, campus protests \"crossed a line from a call for freedom and security for Palestinians and Jews alike to a stereotyped notion: that Israel is not a state, but rather a \u2018settler colony\u2019 of white Europeans who have no real connection with the land they had stolen, that epitomized aggression, and was bereft of virtues.\"",
      "4. Admissions process led to dwindling Jewish population",
      "The report found that changes in Harvard\u2019s admissions policies meant that by 2023, the Jewish student community was much smaller than it was in the early 2010s.",
      "The hostility that some students had felt, the report found, was \"degrading\" to the university, and some Jewish students turned down offers of admission to Harvard over it.",
      "Some Jewish students vying for doctorate degrees said they decided to leave for private industry jobs because of the perception that academia is \"unfriendly to Jews.\"",
      "Some non-Jewish faculty members told the task force that Jewish candidates had turned down post-doctoral fellowships at Harvard and Jewish medical school students shied away from residencies at Harvard hospitals \"because of the deep politicization of the climate.\"",
      "The task force determined Harvard should change its admissions policy to reflect \"what campus should look like: people listening to each other.\"",
      "Pro-Gaza protests have persisted on Harvard's campus since Israel's offensive campaign to eradicate Hamas began after Oct. 7, 2023. (Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)",
      "5. Lack of educational oversight",
      "The task force also found a lack of oversight over seemingly university-endorsed educational content.",
      "The Harvard Chan School of Public Health, for example, launched a Palestinian program in 2022 that is run by a \"leadership collective\" of five individuals, none of whom hold a tenure-track faculty appointment at Harvard.",
      "\"The use of the Harvard brand for a research or teaching project creates expectations among Harvard faculty, staff, students, and the broader public. Programs operating without the guidance and oversight of Harvard\u2019s regular faculty with expertise risk falling short of these expectations,\" the task force found.",
      "In another example, the task force found the coursework for a master's degree in Religion and Public Life to be misrepresented. The program is advertised as offering students a better understanding of religion to illuminate a range of contemporary issues.",
      "Both faculty and students did not expect the program to be as focused on the Israel\u2013Palestinian issue as it was, and some students found \"program offerings and materials disproportionately presented Israelis and Jews as guilty of monstrous historical crimes, which require both repentance and redress.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The program \"appears to have focused on non-mainstream Jewish religious perspectives that lack widespread support within the Jewish diaspora or in Israel.\" It also linked Jews to \"two great sins,\" according to the task force: the creation of the state of Israel and participation in White supremacy, which staff \"appeared to embrace openly.\""

      "Stolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web",
      "With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.",

Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..",
      "Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called\u00a0Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.",
      "Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details.

      "5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.",
      "8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure\u00a0password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "9) Keep your software updated: AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches.\u00a0Regular updates close security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit.",

From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it\u2019s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.",

      "Have you ever wished your daily commute could be as easy and comfortable as driving a car, but as fun and eco-friendly as riding a bike? You are not alone. That is exactly the kind of thinking that inspired the Acticycle. This four-wheeled electric vehicle is shaking up city transportation by blending the best parts of both worlds. With the Acticycle, you get the comfort, weather protection, and storage you would expect from a car, but with the agility, efficiency, and low cost of a bike.",

      "Acticycle specs: What you need to know",
      "Let's start with the numbers, since they really set the\u00a0Acticycle apart. The vehicle measures about 93 inches long, 36 inches wide, and 60 inches tall, making it compact enough for bike lanes and city streets, but roomy enough for two adults or one adult and two small children. It weighs just 220 pounds, about one-fifth the weight of a typical electric car, and can carry up to 660 pounds of passengers and cargo.",
      "The Acticycle rides on four 20-inch reinforced wheels with puncture-resistant tires, and it uses hydraulic disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Depending on the model, you can choose from a 250-watt, 750-watt, or dual 2000-watt motor setup. Top speeds range from 16 miles per hour with the 250-watt motor to 28 miles per hour with the more powerful versions. The removable lithium-ion batteries provide a range of up to 62 miles per charge, and you can double that by adding a second battery. The Acticycle also features a total of 6 cubic feet of cargo space, divided between a secure hard trunk and a flexible soft compartment, so you can haul groceries, gear, or whatever your day demands.",

With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat. This kind of performance is usually reserved for much heavier and more expensive electric vehicles, but the Acticycle brings it to a whole new category.",

The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control.",

      "Eco-friendly and budget-smart",
      "The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet. Its lightweight frame and efficient battery system mean it uses far less energy than a car, and its maintenance needs are similar to a cargo bike rather than a car. You will save money on fuel, parking, insurance, and repairs, all while reducing your environmental impact. It is a win-win for anyone looking to make smarter choices in the city.",

      "When it comes to price, the Acticycle is designed to be a smart investment for urban commuters who want all the benefits of a car and a bike, but without the hefty price tag. While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",

The alert notes that through networks like \"Anyproxy,\" criminals have been selling access to the infected routers as proxy nodes.

      "Many recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers.",
      "One prominent threat is\u00a0TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground.",
      "For users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address.

      "6 ways to stay safe from router hackers",
      "Given the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay.",
      "1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported:\u00a0If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand.",
      "If you're not sure which router to get, check out my list of\u00a0top routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility with\u00a0VPN services.",
      "2) Keep your router's firmware updated:\u00a0Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier.",
      "3) Turn off remote access:\u00a0Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is\u00a0disabled, then save the changes and restart your router.",
      "4) Use a strong password for your router settings:\u00a0Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like\u00a0T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly:\u00a0If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help.",
      "6) Reporting to authorities:\u00a0The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to the\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats.",

Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets. The real challenge isn't just technical. It's about how manufacturers, service providers and users all handle the long tail of aging tech that still lives on in the real world.",

      "Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they\u2019ve become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well).",

On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass?

      "\"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?\"",
      "I get what you\u2019re saying, Frank. You\u2019d think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn\u2019t be bypassed. But you\u2019d be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they\u2019re not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.",

      "A smartphone on a table\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 ways bad actors can bypass fingerprint scanners",
      "There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods.",
      "Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at\u00a0NYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.",
      "Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you\u2019ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,\u00a0researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.",
      "On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn\u2019t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn\u2019t work on them.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",
      "Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone\u2019s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work.",
      "PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.",
      "Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.",

      "So, can you trust fingerprint scanners?",
      "Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don\u2019t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.",
      "Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.",

      "1. Choose trusted phone brands:\u00a0If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "2. Keep your phone updated:\u00a0Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage.\u00a0Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "4. Don\u2019t rely only on your fingerprint:\u00a0Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.",
      "5. Be careful about who handles your phone:\u00a0If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.",
      "6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:\u00a0Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It\u2019s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it\u2019s better to skip it and use your password instead.",
      "7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they\u2019re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don\u2019t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn\u2019t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.",

    "summary": "Massive password leak reveals cybersecurity flaws. Learn how to protect your accounts with strong passwords, two-factor authentication and data removal services.",
    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Passwords are outdated, and it's time for both tech companies and users to move on. There, I said it. Like it or not, the weakest link in cybersecurity is anything that relies on human input. While organizations continue to invest in firewalls and endpoint security, the most persistent vulnerability remains the human password.",
      "The internet has long struggled with poor password practices, but a recent discovery highlights just how serious the problem is.",
      "Security researchers have uncovered more than 19 billion newly leaked passwords, collected from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025. An astonishing 94% of these passwords were either reused, predictable or both.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Between April 2024 and April 2025, data from nearly 200 separate cybersecurity incidents became publicly available, as discovered by\u00a0Cybernews. These were not isolated events. They involved massive leak repositories including combolists, stealer logs and compromised databases. In total, over 3 terabytes of raw leaked data were analyzed, comprising more than 19 billion passwords. Only 6 percent of these, just over 1.1 billion, were unique.",
      "Among the most used passwords, \"123456\" appeared in over 338 million instances. Words like \"Password\" and \"admin\" followed close behind, despite years of public warnings. Such defaults often originate from devices like routers or enterprise tools, where they are rarely changed and frequently reused elsewhere.",
      "1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK",
      "Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities.",
      "Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "The bigger problem",
      "According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely on\u00a0two-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all.",
      "Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms.",

A single compromised password can trigger a domino effect, exposing multiple accounts across services. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.

      "Four ways to stay safe from password-stealing scammers",
      "Protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are four effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your password is stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:\u00a0Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "4. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "When it comes down to it, passwords just aren't cutting it anymore. The sheer number of leaked passwords and the fact that so few are unique show how vulnerable we really are. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster, but we don't have to make it easy for them. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping our software updated and considering extra privacy tools, we can take back some control over this situation. It might take a little effort to change old habits, but the peace of mind you get is worth it.",

      "For Caroline Laubach, being a Wandercraft test pilot is about more than just trying out new technology. It's about reclaiming a sense of freedom and connection that many wheelchair users miss. Laubach, a spinal stroke survivor and full-time wheelchair user, has played a key role in\u00a0demonstrating the personal AI-powered prototype exoskeleton's development, and her experience highlights just how life-changing this device can be.",

      "A personal mission becomes a global vision",
      "Wandercraft's journey began with a personal challenge. Nicolas Simon, the company's co-founder, saw his own family members struggle with mobility due to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic condition. As a student and robotics enthusiast, Simon wanted to create something that could help his brother and others like him walk again.

This device, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approved in Europe, helps patients take over a million steps each month as part of their rehabilitation. It has already helped hundreds regain some mobility and independence.",
      "But Wandercraft wanted to go further. The new Personal Exoskeleton protoype, now in clinical trials in New York and New Jersey, is designed for daily life, at home, at work, and out in the community. It uses NVIDIA AI to adapt instantly to each user's movements, providing smooth, stable walking on all sorts of surfaces, from sidewalks to carpets.

The team uses Nvidia Isaac Sim, a powerful simulation tool, to test and improve the exoskeleton in virtual environments before real-world trials. They're also exploring Nvidia's healthcare robotics and edge computing platforms to make the device smarter and more responsive.",
      "This technology means the exoskeleton can someday keep up with everyday life, walking at a normal pace, crossing streets, and even handling stairs. As Simon puts it, \"It's essential for the exoskeleton to be fast enough that it can be used in the real world. By integrating NVIDIA AI into the device, we can someday enable users to walk at an average pace, cross the road, and go up and down stairs.\"",

Unlike a search engine that simply points you to existing content, AI can generate entirely new ideas, images and text based on what you ask. It\u2019s more than a search box; it\u2019s a creative tool.

      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",

      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system.

Experts point to the rise of\u00a0cryptocurrency schemes,\u00a0AI-generated content and\u00a0organized criminal groups operating from Southeast Asia. These scams range from fake investment opportunities to misleading product offers and even the sale of nonexistent puppies.",

A spokesperson described the situation as an\u00a0\"epidemic of scams\" and insisted that Meta is taking aggressive action, removing more than 2 million accounts linked to scam centers in several countries this year alone.",
      "However, insiders tell a different story. Current and former Meta employees say the company has been reluctant to make it harder for advertisers to buy ads, fearing it could hurt the company's bottom line. Staff reportedly tolerated between eight and 32 fraud \"strikes\" before banning accounts and scam enforcement was deprioritized to avoid losing ad revenue.",

      "How to protect yourself from scam ads",
      "Staying safe online takes a little extra effort, but it's well worth it. Here are some steps you can follow to avoid falling victim to scam ads.",
      "1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

      "In 2013, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office (OPSO), which runs the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility, entered into a consent decree with the Department of Justice to keep the jail operational. The decree stemmed from civil rights abuses, and OPSO agreed to federal government oversight and biannual compliance checks.",
      "The latest of those compliance check reports shows that the jail was fully compliant with 42% of the decree's measures and completely noncompliant with at least 5% of them. It is partially compliant with about 53% of the measures.",

      "Law enforcement searches for a fugitive in New Orleans on May 21, 2025. (Chris Granger/Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP)",

      "The meeting brought together two strong-willed political outsiders. Milei, a libertarian economist known for cutting government spending, and Kennedy, a Trump-appointed health chief skeptical of pandemic-era mandates. Both promised to challenge what they call global overreach and politicized health policy.",
      "Argentina officially confirmed its exit from the WHO during Kennedy\u2019s visit, following Milei\u2019s initial announcement in February.

      "Milei\u2019s government blasted the WHO for what it called a failed COVID response. \"The WHO\u2019s prescriptions do not work because they are not based on science but on political interests and bureaucratic structures that refuse to review their own mistakes,\" the government said, referring to the group\u2019s lockdown strategy as a \"caveman quarantine.\"",
      "Kennedy offered support, encouraging other countries to also exit the WHO in a recent address to the World Health Assembly. He has argued the organization is compromised by foreign governments and corporate interests, and that a fresh approach is needed.",
      "After the meeting, Kennedy posted on X: \"I had a wonderful meeting with President Milei about the mutual withdrawal of our nations from the WHO and the creation of an alternative international health system... free from totalitarian impulses, corruption, and political control.\"",

      "His tough measures have produced results: Argentina posted its first budget surplus in nearly 15 years and sharply reduced monthly inflation.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s MAHA campaign echoes Milei\u2019s anti-establishment style, but in the health sector. The Trump administration\u2019s health agenda has focused on rolling back federal overreach, enforcing science-based policy, and promoting transparency in public health.",

Milei identifies his political philosophy as libertarian. (@SecKennedy via X)",
      "Tuesday\u2019s meeting marks a deeper alignment between Argentina and the current U.S. administration. Milei has welcomed top American officials in recent months and shown clear interest in building strong ties with Washington. Now, by joining the U.S. in rejecting the WHO, Milei becomes the first foreign leader to openly back Trump\u2019s health sovereignty push.",
      "The decision is a major departure from Argentina\u2019s previous international partnerships and could signal a shift for other countries weighing similar moves. Both Milei and Kennedy have framed the initiative as the start of a more accountable and independent global health network.",
      "Critics, including some in Argentina\u2019s opposition, warn that leaving the WHO could limit access to funding and vaccines. Global health experts largely defend the WHO\u2019s role, despite acknowledging its COVID missteps.",

      "This is not a new or empty threat. Several former hostages reported being threatened and said they were told that their captors would execute them if Israeli forces got close.

    "summary": "A U.K. report suggests chemical castration for sex offenders to ease prison overcrowding, sparking debate over ethics and informed consent in medical treatment.",
    "story": [
      "The U.K. is considering mandating the use of chemical castration for sex offenders under an overhaul of the justice system aimed at freeing up more space in its overcrowded prisons, Reuters reported. (Credit: Reuters.)",
      "A British government minister says she\u2019s \"not squeamish\" about the idea of chemical castration for male sex offenders, and wants to make it mandatory.",
      "The UK is considering a range of options from a new report, which aims to cut the country\u2019s prison population by 10,000 inmates to help alleviate chronic overcrowding.",
      "\"Problematic sexual arousal and preoccupation can be reduced via chemical suppressants and other medications, which can be prescribed for individuals who have committed a sexual offense under certain circumstances,\" the new report states.",
      "Prisons in the south-west of England have been involved in a pilot program of chemical castrations since 2002, and Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood from the ruling Labour Party told lawmakers in parliament on Thursday that the program would expand to 20 more prisons in two other regions of England.",

      "Prisoners would be given two drugs as part of the treatment: one limits sexual thoughts, while the other reduces testosterone and \"problematic sexual arousal.\" Inmates would also have ongoing counseling to treat their psychological issues, such as a desire for sexual power and control. One recent study found that reoffending rates were up to 60% lower for prisoners who had received the treatment.",
      "\"For some, offending relates to power, but for another subset of offenders, the combination of chemical suppressants and psychological interventions can, we believe, have a big and positive impact,\" Minister Mahmood told parliament.",
      "Initially, the option for chemical castration treatment would be only voluntary, and medical ethicists say it could be a problem to force doctors to treat an inmate who doesn\u2019t want to have it done. In Britain, there is a strict tradition of informed medical consent where a patient can refuse medical treatment, and a doctor can\u2019t ordinarily be forced to carry it out.",

(Photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images)",
      "Sex offenders make up a significant percentage of the prison population in England, and at the end of March, more than 20% of inmates were incarcerated on sex crimes charges. The new report cautions that chemical castration \"should never be used as a risk management tool or standalone rehabilitative offer, and it is only appropriate for a limited number of sex offenders\".",
      "Chemical castration is already being used in some other European prisons to treat sex offenders. Authorities in Sweden have been carrying out limited clinical trials on volunteers at a Stockholm prison, while in Germany and Denmark it is more widely used but still on a voluntary basis. In Poland, courts can pass a sentence of mandatory chemical castration for some categories of sex-offense prisoners.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report, written by a former government minister from the Conservative Party, also made four dozen recommendations to try and ease prison overcrowding.",
      "These include giving fewer people jail sentences under 12 months and encouraging other types of punishment instead, such as community service or fines; developing new policies for early release with good behavior for inmates, and tagging all offenders who committed crimes of abuse against women and girls.",

      "The opposition Conservative Party has criticized the new report, saying that by scrapping shorter prison sentences the government \"is effectively decriminalizing crimes like burglary, theft and assault.\"",
      "\"This is a gift to criminals, who will be free to offend with impunity,\" the party\u2019s justice spokesman Robert Jenrick told reporters.",
      "However, the report has been broadly welcomed by the Howard League for Penal Reform, the world\u2019s oldest prison charity.",

      "\"The government is taking an important step forward by accepting most of the recommendations from this important review,\" says Chief Executive Andrea Coomber, but she cautioned that \"the prisons crisis will not be solved by half-measures.\"",
      "Senior police officers have cautioned that if there will be fewer prisoners behind bars, they need more resources to manage the risk that offenders pose outside of jail.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to make it easier for officials to deport convicted criminals to \"third countries\" that are not their countries of origin.",
      "The administration is seeking to block an injunction in which Massachusetts-based U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy said the affected immigrants nationwide should be given a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise concerns that they may be at risk of torture, persecution or death.",
      "Murphy later clarified that they should have at least 10 days to bring their claims.",
      "Just last week, he said the administration had violated his previous order by flying eight migrants to South Sudan. The men are now being held in a U.S. facility in Djibouti.",
      "All the immigrants potentially affected by the litigation are already subject to deportation but cannot be sent to their countries of origin, so the case hinges on what legal process they receive before they can be deported.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the new filing that Murphy's rulings require the government to undertake \"an onerous set of procedures\" that he had no authority to require.",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process. In addition to usurping the Executive\u2019s authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Trina Realmuto, a lawyer at the National Immigration Litigation Alliance who represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement that Murphy \"took limited and appropriate actions to ensure that people are afforded due process protections before the government can deport them to third countries.\"",
      "Murphy's original order in April concluded that plaintiffs were merely asking for basic due process.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are simply asking to be told they are going to be deported to a new country before they are taken to such a country, and be given an opportunity to explain why such a deportation will likely result in their persecution, torture, and/or death,\" he wrote.",
      "On Monday night, Murphy rejected a government attempt to reconsider his requirements as it relates to the men now in South Sudan.",
      "\u201cIt turns out that having immigration proceedings on another continent is harder and more logistically cumbersome than Defendants anticipated,\" he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt continues to be this Court\u2019s sincere hope that reason can get the better of rhetoric,\" he added."

      "\u201cEffective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor visa appointment capacity,\" the cable said.",
      "The memo also warned of \u201cpotentially significant implications for consular section operations, processes, and resource allocations\u201d in a clear indication of the delay likely for student visa applications.",
      "\u201cConsular sections will need to take into consideration the workload and resource requirements of each case prior to scheduling them going forward,\u201d the cable said, adding the priority should be on \u201cservices for U.S. citizens, immigrant visas, and fraud prevention.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how the prospective students\u2019 social media would be screened as part of the expanded vetting procedures. The public views and speech of international students have come under increased scrutiny during the Trump administration.",

      "The video shows a white SUV as it makes a couple of U-turns and speeds away as a long line of law enforcement vehicles follows. The SUV comes to a stop, law enforcement officers move in with guns drawn, and the two, Jermaine Donald and Leo Tate, are pulled out at gunpoint.",

      "Flood, who holds a law degree from the University of Nebraska, said that he did not agree with the provision and that he was unaware of it when he voted in favor of the bill.",

I\u2019ve taken an oath as an attorney, I\u2019ve taken an oath as a state senator, I\u2019ve taken an oath as a member of Congress, and I support our court system, and I do believe that the federal district courts, when issuing an injunction, should have legal effect. In fact, I relied upon that when the Biden administration was in place. The federal courts did a tremendous amount of good work,\u201d Flood said.",
      "\u201cThis provision was unknown to me when I voted for the bill,\u201d he finished, to loud yells from the crowd.",
      "As the moderator tried to move on to the next question, Flood stopped her, saying: \u201cI am not going to hide the truth. This provision was unknown to me when I voted for that, and when I found out that provision was in the bill, I immediately reached out to my Senate counterparts and told them of my concern.\u201d",
      "Flood\u2019s words did not calm attendees, who continued their shouting.",
      "The questions only got more intense from there, with attendees grilling him on a number of topics, from Medicaid cuts to his voting record to changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "Flood won handily in Seward County, winning re-election with 77.6% of the county\u2019s votes in November \u2014 higher than President Donald Trump, who won 72.2% in the county. Flood won his district with 60.1% of the vote.",
      "The Nebraska Democratic Party encouraged followers Tuesday to \u201cpack the place\u201d and ask Flood questions at the town hall.",
      "One person accused Flood of being a \u201cfascist\u201d and asked him whether he would be willing to invoke articles of impeachment against Trump.",
      "Flood denied the accusation, saying, \u201cI get that you get an applause line when you call me a fascist, but I\u2019m not. I am not a fascist, I\u2019m an American, and I would never call you something like that.\u201d",
      "Yet another person accused him of lying over promises to protect health care but voting in favor of the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which could trigger cuts. The bill would slash hundreds of billions of dollars for Medicaid and SNAP.",
      "In response, Flood said Nebraska does not provide benefits to undocumented immigrants, arguing that the bill\u2019s cuts would target that group of people and not his state. Minutes later, Flood turned the question on the crowd, asking, \u201cQuestion for the audience, do you want illegal immigrants to get tax-funded benefits?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jody Armentrout was sitting at an exit row seat on Saturday's All Nippon Airways Flight 114 traveling from Tokyo to Houston when he noticed a man was acting strangely.",
      "Armentrout, a sergeant major who has served in the Marines for over 20 years and is based in Japan, has been trained to be vigilant. He said he saw the man take his backpack to one of the bathrooms, then come out and go to another bathroom and then, another bathroom.",
      "\"He came out of that one and began pacing up and down the aisle, so that just threw my radar on,\" Armentrout, 50, said in a phone interview.",
      "But then, Armentrout said, he saw the man eyeing up the emergency exit right next to him. Armentrout said he stood up, putting himself between the man and the exit door.",
      "That's when the man turned around, ran through the plane's galley and darted to the exit door on the opposite side, Armentrout said. He knew he had seconds to act.",
      "\"He grabbed a strap around the door, pulled it off, and about that time is when I took him and slammed him, put him on the ground,\" Armentrout said. \"And then there was an older gentleman sitting on that side that woke up, and he got up and kind of helped me.\"",
      "Armentrout said flight attendants handed him zip ties, which he placed around the man's wrists and used to secure him to a seat. It was announced that the plane would be diverted to Seattle as a result of the incident, and Armentrout said he sat next to the man until they landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.",
      "\"His eyes \u2014 you could definitely tell there was something going on,\" Armentrout said.",
      "All Nippon Airways Flight 114 departed from Haneda Airport on Saturday morning and was heading to Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport when a passenger became \u201cunruly,\u201d the airline said. Port of Seattle police told NBC News that the passenger was trying to open exit doors during the flight.",
      "Police confirmed that passengers and flight crew members restrained the man, who has not been identified.",
      "The flight landed at Seattle at 4:19 a.m. PT, and the man was taken off the plane, police said. He was evaluated, and it was determined he was \u201chaving a medical crisis,\" police said. The man was later taken to a local hospital.",
      "Armentrout said he acted out of concern for his fellow passengers, especially multiple babies.",
      "\"I just knew he was up to something crazy, and at the end of the day, I was willing to take the risk of him saying 'I'm not doing anything' and then just them making him go sit back down than me allowing him to do anything that's going to put anybody at risk,\" Armentrout said.",
      "Other passengers took the time to thank Armentrout for acting when he did, he said.",
      "But the eventfulness of the flight did not stop there. Once they were on the tarmac in Seattle, another passenger who \"was frustrated at the flight diversion\" punched a bathroom door, according to the FBI's Seattle field office.",
      "That person, who has not been identified, was removed from the flight, which eventually landed in Houston at 12:42 p.m. CT, according to FlightAware.com.",
      "After having finally arrived in Houston, Armentrout said he was glad his feet were on the ground.",
      "\"It was a weird flight,\" he said, adding that he will return to Japan on Friday and is feeling a little anxious about the journey.",
      "Keeping in mind what happened, Armentrout wants others to stay aware of their surroundings.",
      "\"I want to make sure everybody understands what time we are in in this world nowadays and that they need to be aware of their surroundings all the time,\" he said."

      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 Planned Parenthood halted abortions in Missouri on Tuesday after the state's top court ordered new rulings in the tumultuous legal saga over a ban that voters struck down last November.",
      "The state's top court ruled that a district judge applied the wrong standard in rulings in December and February that allowed abortions to resume in the state. Nearly all abortions were halted under a ban that took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "In Tuesday's two-page ruling, the court ordered Judge Jerri Zhang to vacate her earlier orders and reevaluate the case using the standards the court laid out. Zhang ruled that she was allowing abortions to resume largely because advocates were likely to prevail in the case eventually. The Supreme Court said it should first consider whether there would be harms from allowing abortions to resume.",
      "The state emphasized in its petition filed to the state Supreme Court in March that Planned Parenthood didn't sufficiently prove women were harmed without the temporary blocks on the broad swath of laws and regulations on abortion services and providers. On the contrary, the state said Zhang's decisions left abortion facilities \"functionally unregulated\" and women with \"no guarantee of health and safety.\"",
      "Among the regulations that had been placed on hold were ones setting cleanliness standards for abortion facilities and requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles (48 kilometers) or 15 minutes of where an abortion is provided.",
      "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in a statement that \"today's decision from the Missouri Supreme Court is a win for women and children and sends a clear message \u2014 abortion providers must comply with state law regarding basic safety and sanitation requirements.\"",
      "Planned Parenthood maintains that those restrictions were specifically targeted to make it harder to access abortion.",
      "Still, the organization \u2014 which has the state's only abortion clinics \u2014 immediately started calling patients to cancel abortion appointments at Missouri clinics in Columbia and Kansas City, according to Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.",
      "Wales said it's a familiar but disappointing position for the organization.",
      "\"We have had to call patients in Missouri previously and say you were scheduled for care, your appointment is now canceled because of political interference, new restrictions, licensure overreach by the state,\" she said. \"To be in that position again, after the people of Missouri voted to ensure abortion access, is frustrating.\"",
      "Wales said Planned Parenthood hopes to be back in court soon.",
      "Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri, said he was \"extremely excited\" by the Supreme Court order.",
      "\"This means that our pro-life laws, which include many health and safety protections for women, will remain in place,\" Lee said. \"How long they will remain we will have to see.\""

      "President Donald Trump called two of the children of imprisoned reality television couple Todd and Julie Chrisley from the Oval Office on Tuesday, informing them of his plans to pardon their parents as soon as Wednesday.",
      "The pair, known for their roles on the TV show \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d sought pardons from Trump in February after they were convicted of bilking banks out of tens of millions of dollars in 2022, NBC News reported.",
      "A judge had handed down sentences of 12 years for Todd Chrisley and seven years for his wife, Julie Chrisley, in November 2022 after an Atlanta jury found them guilty of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud the United States following a weekslong federal trial.",
      "A White House official told NBC News that Trump will sign the pardons once they are ready \u2014 most likely within 24 hours.",
      "Trump told two of their children, Savannah and Grayson Chrisley, in a phone call that he planned to pardon the couple.",
      "\"It\u2019s a terrible thing, but it\u2019s a great thing because your parents are going to be free and clean,\" Trump said on the call. \"We\u2019ll try getting it done tomorrow, so give them \u2014 I don\u2019t know them \u2014 but give them my regards and wish them well. Wish them a good life.\"",
      "Grayson Chrisley responded, \"Mr. President, I just want to say thank you for bringing my parents back.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement that Trump is \"always pleased to give well-deserving Americans a second chance, especially those who have been unfairly targeted and overly prosecuted by an unjust justice system.\"",
      "\"President Trump called Savannah and her brother from the Oval Office to personally inform them that he would be pardoning their parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, whose sentences were far too harsh,\" Fields said.",
      "Prosecutors said Todd and Julie Chrisley conspired to defraud Atlanta-area banks of more than $36 million in personal loans by submitting false bank statements and other records, which they spent on luxury cars and travel.",
      "They later defrauded the IRS, evading collection of $500,000 in taxes owed by Todd Chrisley, prosecutors alleged, while raking in millions of dollars from their TV show. The Chrisleys were also alleged to have failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes for tax years 2013 through 2016.",
      "Trump said Monday he had granted Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff, a pardon. Jenkins was sentenced in March to 10 years in prison for accepting over $75,000 in bribes in return for appointing a series of Virginia businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs in his department.",
      "Trump said Jenkins, a former sheriff of Culpeper County, and his family had \"been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized\" Justice Department during the Biden administration, an accusation that has underpinned many of his calls for clemency since he returned to the White House.",
      "Trump has extended pardons and commutations to thousands of people since he began his second term, including roughly 1,500 criminal defendants who were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot."

    "story": [
      "It started with nausea and loss of appetite.",
      "Robert Grafton, of Turnersville, New Jersey, tried to convince himself he was just coming down with something one weekend in mid-March. Then came the itching and dark urine. Grafton, a former interventional radiology technologist whose wife is a nurse, recognized the hallmarks of liver failure.",
      "The otherwise healthy 54-year-old had a gut feeling that his herbal and dietary supplements were the culprit.",
      "\u201cI stopped taking everything, thank goodness,\u201d Grafton said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t known, if I was not in the medical field, I might have thought, \u2018Oh, I think I\u2019m getting sick. I need to take some more of these supplements to help me feel better.\u2019\u201d",
      "When his symptoms had only worsened by midweek, Grafton visited his primary care physician. The doctor, he said, suspected hepatitis A, a liver infection that can be caused by consuming food or drink contaminated with the hepatitis A virus. Grafton\u2019s laboratory test results showed otherwise.",
      "\u201cMy liver enzymes were super elevated, my bilirubin was really high \u2014 all the signs of liver failure,\u201d Grafton said. \u201cI pretty much broke down, my wife as well. I was, at that point, thinking it was liver cancer, pancreatic cancer or something.\u201d",
      "That Friday, less than a week after his symptoms had begun, Grafton was admitted to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, where he received a diagnosis.",
      "\u201cIt turns out I had something called a drug-induced liver injury, which came from my supplements.\u201d",
      "Rising rates of liver damage",
      "The liver is responsible for more than 500 functions in the human body, including filtering harmful substances from the blood. Some people\u2019s livers metabolize toxins more slowly than others, but too much of certain drugs can overwhelm even the healthiest liver.",
      "When taken in excess, acetaminophen, for example, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is among the most common causes of drug-induced liver injury, also called toxic hepatitis. Pharmaceutical products aren\u2019t solely the cause. Herbal and dietary supplements are causing liver damage with mounting prevalence.",
      "From 1995 through 2020, supplement-related liver failure requiring U.S. patients to be waitlisted for transplants increased eightfold, according to a 2022 study in the journal Liver Transplantation. In addition, a 2017 review in the journal Hepatology found that 20% of liver toxicity cases nationwide are tied to herbal and dietary supplements. Because \u201cmulti-ingredient nutritional supplements\u201d caused the majority of those cases, the authors said, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint which component(s) may be to blame.",
      "Whereas dietary supplements typically contain nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and amino acids from a range of sources such as fish oil, herbal supplements are a subset of dietary supplements composed of plant-based ingredients.",
      "Liver damage linked to supplements is rare. How rare is unclear.",
      "What is known is why cases are on the rise: More Americans are taking supplements. As many as 3 in 4 adults 18 and older take them, according to a 2024 survey by the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group representing the dietary supplement and functional food industry. Almost 4 in 5 users said they prefer supplements to prescription or over-the-counter medications.",
      "By comparison, the 2017\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that 58% of adults 20 and older had used a dietary supplement in the past 30 days.",
      "\u201cI think people assume these things are safe,\u201d said Dr. Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a Jefferson Health hepatologist who treated Grafton. \u201cThe No. 1 reason we see people taking these are for good health or to supplement their health, and so I don\u2019t think that they realize that there is a real risk here.\u201d",
      "Grafton was one such consumer. The father of five became more health-conscious when he hit 50, going to the gym and starting a supplement regimen that included fenugreek, DHEA, ashwagandha, L-carnitine and nitric oxide. He continued that cocktail, with few changes, for years without incident. About a month before he got sick, Grafton added turmeric pills to the mix, with the goal of reducing inflammation.",
      "Then Grafton saw the social media promo he said helped set his health crisis in motion.",
      "Ironically, he bought an advertised turmeric-based liquid supplement in part because it claims to support long-term liver health. Similar products are widely available.",
      "\u201cThe whole push with that is that you\u2019re getting a super-high, concentrated dose of turmeric and dandelion root and milk thistle, which I have always known from my medical past is good for liver health,\u201d Grafton said. \u201cIt all sounded good. \u2026 I thought I did enough digging.\u201d",
      "He fell ill within a week of adding the liquid supplement to his routine.",
      "Even though Grafton stopped the turmeric pills the day he started the turmeric drink, Halegoua-De Marzio said, turmeric overload most likely caused his liver injury. Not only was the drink ultra-concentrated; the pills contained 2,250 mg of curcumin, a substance that comes from the root of the turmeric plant. The pills also include black pepper extract, which Halegoua-De Marzio warned increases absorption twentyfold.",
      "\u201cWhen you cook with turmeric, that could be really safe. But some of the supplements now are 2,000 mg plus, which is a very high dose of turmeric,\u201d she said. Coupled with black pepper, \u201cthe liver now has to break down that supplement and it can\u2019t. It could make it really sick.\u201d",
      "The supplement spectrum includes everything from powders that claim to promote muscle growth to gummies that promise to reduce stress. When it comes to herbal supplements, natural doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better or safer, Halegoua-De Marzio said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what I hear from patients all the time \u2014 \u2018Oh, I want something natural\u2019 \u2014 this fear of prescription medicines being unsafe,\u201d she said, adding that while prescriptions bear their own risks, they\u2019ve gone through rigorous clinical trials.",
      "Supplements aren\u2019t subjected to the same premarket testing.",
      "Among herbal ingredients tied to toxic hepatitis, turmeric is the most commonly consumed in the U.S., according to a study published last year in the journal JAMA Network Open. Following that are green tea extract, ashwagandha, Garcinia cambogia, red yeast rice and black cohosh.",
      "About 15.6 million Americans take supplements containing at least one of these six botanicals, the study found. Most reported doing so on their own, not under a doctor\u2019s advice.",
      "Prescription medications are tightly regulated and therefore more easily quantified; it\u2019s difficult to determine how many people consume supplements whose ingredients can cause liver damage. A goal of the JAMA Network Open research was to capture this magnitude \u2014 at least where herbal supplements are concerned \u2014 said co-author Dr. Robert Fontana, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for other doctors to know, for the general public to know,\u201d Fontana said. \u201cThe denominator of use is going up.\u201d",
      "Fontana and Halegoua-De Marzio are part of the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, a research group backed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. More than 1,800 patients have been enrolled since the program\u2019s 2004 inception, with 19% of cases tied to supplements.",
      "Previous research has estimated that the U.S. sees 44,000 cases of liver damage linked to medications and supplements annually, including 2,700 deaths. The actual incidence is likely higher, Fontana said. Liver failure symptoms can be vague, so some people may be unaware they have the condition. People who sought natural remedies in the form of supplements may be wary of seeing a doctor. Others, Fontana said, may be embarrassed about inadvertently harming themselves; botanical users in his 2024 research were older, wealthier and more educated than nonusers.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re the patient, you\u2019re like, \u2018Why did this happen to me?\u2019\u201d Fontana said. \u201c\u2018What do you mean, this stuff isn\u2019t safe?\u2019\u201d",
      "FDA doesn\u2019t monitor supplement safety before sale",
      "For Joanne Slavin, a registered dietitian and professor in the department of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota, consumer education on the risks and rewards of supplements is critical.",
      "\u201cWe really only know human data when something goes wrong,\u201d she said.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration maintains a searchable database of recalls, market withdrawals and safety alerts but can\u2019t vet supplements for safety or effectiveness before they hit store shelves. Only once they\u2019re on the market does the agency have the authority to penalize \u201cadulterated or misbranded\u201d products. That\u2019s thanks to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which limited the FDA\u2019s reach. The number of supplements on sale today is almost 20 times as many as three decades ago.",
      "Consuming supplements comes with risks, the FDA warns.",
      "\u201cDietary supplements may contain ingredients that can have strong effects in the body, even if the ingredients are natural or plant-derived,\u201d the agency said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cAdverse events are more likely to occur if consumers take supplements in high doses, take multiple supplements or take supplements instead of or in addition to medications.\u201d",
      "According to the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), dietary supplements can\u2019t make claims concerning the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation or curing of a disease.",
      "\u201cDietary supplements can\u2019t say they can cure your cold, they can\u2019t say they can prevent your Alzheimer\u2019s or your cancer,\u201d CRN President and CEO Steve Mister said. \u201cIf you see (such) a product out there, it is blatantly illegal.\u201d",
      "Dietary supplements have their place",
      "In short, he said, supplements are intended for healthy people who are trying to stay healthy.",
      "While everyone should ideally get all nutrients through a balanced diet, Slavin said, she recognizes that dietary supplements have their place. People who don\u2019t eat red meat, for instance, may need to seek an alternate source of iron.",
      "\u201cA supplement is fine, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s on the individual basis rather than the public health basis for the whole world.\u201d",
      "Monitoring how many vitamins or mineral supplements are taken daily is straightforward, Slavin said.",
      "The federal Office of Dietary Supplements has established daily upper limits for nutrients, from vitamin A to zinc, which vary by age and sex. Calcium, for example, has an upper limit of 2,000 mg per day for adults 51 and older \u2014 including food, drink and supplements.",
      "Herbal supplements have no such boundaries and aren\u2019t as well studied.",
      "\u201cEverything can be toxic at a certain amount,\u201d said Andrea Wong, CRN senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s really up to the manufacturers and the researchers who are looking at these ingredients to determine what is the beneficial amount \u2026 then also look at what would be the amount where you start seeing some evidence of toxicity.\u201d",
      "She said it\u2019s important to let your doctor know about any supplements you\u2019re taking or starting. Some supplements may interfere with prescription medications or each other, or be unsafe for people with certain medical conditions. For example, the FDA advises against taking any combination of aspirin, vitamin E, prescription warfarin or herbal supplement ginkgo biloba \u2014 all are blood thinners and may increase risk of stroke or internal bleeding.",
      "According to Fontana, some people are even genetically susceptible to supplement-induced liver damage.",
      "\u201cThat means there\u2019s a biological basis as to why they were the one in 1,000, one in 10,000 people who took this and got into trouble,\u201d Fontana said of supplements. \u201cThe same thing is true for prescription drugs; we\u2019re finding genetic associations.\u201d",
      "The federal LiverTox database is a free tool highlighting medicines and supplements linked to liver injury.",
      "The liver is usually a forgiving organ, Fontana said.",
      "Grafton\u2019s was. His hospital stay was brief, and he said his blood work had returned to normal within weeks of ceasing supplements. Additional testing revealed no permanent damage to his liver.",
      "He said he has a new lease on life and resumed his health kick \u2014 with one notable exception.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t take any supplements whatsoever.\u201d"

      "A small Arkansas town is on edge after a former police chief convicted of fatally shooting a man and sexually assaulting an elementary school teacher escaped from prison Sunday wearing a \"makeshift\" law enforcement uniform.",
      "Residents of Garfield expressed fear and anger as the search for Grant Hardin entered its third day.",
      "\"This whole weekend, I\u2019ve kept the house locked,\" Brenda Fields, 60, said in a phone interview Tuesday. \"He was in law enforcement, so he\u2019s not just your average person. That makes me more nervous because he had that background.\"",
      "Rex Littrell lives up the street from Hardin\u2019s parents in Garfield, a town of about 600 people in northwest Arkansas, about 40 miles northeast of Fayetteville and not far from the Missouri border. He said that because of the nature of the crimes, Hardin should have been under careful watch.",
      "\"He should never have had a chance to escape. He\u2019s killed somebody and he\u2019s raped somebody,\" he said.",
      "Fields, who lives across the street from Hardin's parents, said she learned about his escape on Facebook.",
      "\"My dad lives right next to us, too, and he\u2019s locked all of his stuff up, locked up the outbuildings,\" she added, saying she's \"scared.\" \"I wish they\u2019d hurry up and find him.\"",
      "Hardin, the former police chief in the neighboring town of Gateway, has been on the run since Sunday afternoon after he escaped from the North Central Unit in Calico Rock, which is about 140 miles east of Garfield. He was convicted of killing Gateway City water employee James Appleton in 2017 and raping teacher Amy Harrison in 1997 \u2014 cases featured in the Max documentary \"Devil in the Ozarks.\"",
      "He was Gateway's police chief for about four months in early 2016. He also held jobs as an officer, a county constable and a corrections officer, NBC affiliate KNWA of Fayetteville reported.",
      "The Stone County Sheriff\u2019s Office said he escaped through a sally port, a controlled entry or exit area at the facility. He was wearing a \"makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement,\" officials have said.",
      "A photo released by the sheriff's office showed Hardin dressed in all black, appearing to push a wheeled cart with wooden pallets on it.",
      "Law enforcement agencies from across the state have joined the search. He remained at large Tuesday afternoon, and the state Corrections Department had no new updates.",
      "The Izard County Sheriff\u2019s Office warned residents to keep their doors locked and stay inside, county officials said.",
      "The lack of information about Hardin's whereabouts is frustrating for Cheryl Tillman, the mayor of Gateway and sister of Appleton.",
      "\"It brings back a lot of memories of when it first happened,\" she said. \"I can\u2019t believe this has happened. I mean, what were they doing down at the prison that this happened?\"",
      "Tillman said law enforcement has not reached out to her family about Hardin's escape. She learned the news Sunday from an automated phone call from a jail messaging system.",
      "\"All it said was that Grant Hardin had escaped from prison,\" she recalled. \"Nobody\u2019s been in contact with us. ... I find it pretty sad that authorities have not reached out to us.\"",
      "She said people in the community \"are a little scared.\" Tillman has taken extra precautions by having someone with her when she goes to work.",
      "\"You just have to stay vigilant and watch your surroundings,\" she said. \"That\u2019s what I do.\"",
      "Hardin was serving a 30-year sentence for Appleton's murder and a 50-year sentence for the sexual assault of Harrison when he escaped.",
      "Appleton was talking to his brother-in-law when he was shot in his car Feb. 23, 2017, according to an affidavit filed in the case. The following year, a DNA sample linked him to the cold case rape of Harrison at Frank Tillery Elementary School. Hardin pleaded guilty in both cases.",
      "Harrison declined to comment Tuesday.",
      "Fields said Appleton was always a \"really nice guy.\"",
      "\"He used to come to our house once a month to read the water meter,\" she said.",
      "Littrell said there was \"no reason for James to have died.\"",
      "\"There was no reason for what happened to James to have happened. It was just bloody murder,\" he said, calling Appleton a \"good guy.\"",
      "Tillman said that the family has struggled to move on over the years and that Hardin's escape adds to their pain.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t say the first couple of years were easy. They were pretty hard,\" she said. \"Then you try and go on, and things subsided, and then 'wham,' all this comes back up again. It\u2019s very hard.\""

      "There\u2019s a growing sentiment across a Democratic Party searching for a path forward: Team Obama\u2019s bloom may be falling off the rose.",
      "More Democrats are openly criticizing former President Barack Obama\u2019s strategists and consultants \u2014 including David Plouffe, who played a key role in Kamala Harris\u2019 2024 campaign \u2014 who were long treated as the high priests of their party\u2019s politics.",
      "Democratic National Committee officials at a news event last month blamed Obama\u2019s lack of investment in state parties over his two terms for setting back local organizing, with the party still feeling the effects.",
      "The so-called Obama coalition of voters \u2014 less politically engaged voters, younger voters and voters of color \u2014 is no more. In 2024, each of those groups shifted toward Donald Trump in high numbers.",
      "Going forward, it could mark a clean slate for a party whose course for nearly two decades cascaded from decisions Obama had made.",
      "It was Obama who chose Joe Biden as his vice president, offering him the elevated perch that set up his 2020 election and his aborted 2024 re-election campaign. Obama selected Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state, then anointed her for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 race against Trump. The operatives Obama and his top aides empowered have carved out leading, decision-making roles at the top of the Democratic Party since then.",
      "Obama himself remains a force in the party, filling stadiums and commanding the attention of major donors. Indeed, the DNC is in talks with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to host Obama for a fundraiser at his home, according to two people with knowledge of the planning, which is still in its early stages.",
      "But even the former president\u2019s luster was showing signs of fading last fall, a phenomenon that threatens to persist as the next crop of young voters ages into adulthood. When the 2028 presidential election arrives, it will be 20 years since Obama\u2019s first victory. At that point, more voters will have come of age in the era of Trump than in the era of Obama.",

      "New Jersey governor\u2019s race tests the staying power of Democrats\u2019 county machines",
      "One metric has traditionally been all but definitive when it comes to New Jersey Democratic contests: the county line. And by that metric, one candidate is running circles around the others ahead of the June 10 gubernatorial primary: Rep. Mikie Sherrill.",
      "Sherrill has won endorsements from 10 of the state\u2019s 21 county Democratic organizations, including three of the four largest. Only two of the other five candidates in the race, Rep. Josh Gottheimer and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, have notched any county endorsements.",
      "The counties in which Sherrill has won support account for nearly 60% of all registered Democrats in the state. They include the county in which her 11th Congressional District is based, Morris, and the two others that it touches, Passaic and Essex. Gottheimer, whose 5th District is based in Bergen, also represents part of Passaic and Sussex. And Ras Baraka is the mayor of Newark, the largest city in Essex (and the state). Sweeney, the only candidate from South Jersey, has largely swept that region, where the county organizations typically act as a bloc.",
      "What has traditionally made these endorsements so meaningful is the preferred ballot position that came with them. An endorsed candidate would run at the top of the Democratic county organization\u2019s official line, an official-looking and impossible-to-miss column that would also include a host of familiar local names running for lower offices. Names of the other candidates would be listed by themselves, often in the far reaches of the ballot.",
      "The results were predictable: Candidates running off the line almost never won and generally got blown out. The last open Democratic gubernatorial primary was essentially settled a year before any votes were cast, when the largest county organizations threw their support to now-Gov. Phil Murphy.",
      "But a successful lawsuit last year and a new law signed by Murphy in March have changed the game. The line is gone and county parties can no longer list all of their endorsed candidates in a special column. Primary ballots now list candidates by the office they are seeking. One of the questions heading into June\u2019s primary is how much this has diminished the power of county endorsements.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge doubled down on his decision ordering the return of a Guatemalan migrant to the United States after his deportation was found to have lacked due process.",
      "On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts denied a motion from the Department of Justice asking the court to reconsider an order issued Friday, instructing the administration of President Donald Trump \"to take all immediate steps to facilitate\" the migrant's return to the U.S.",
      "Identified only as O.C.G., the migrant said in a court declaration that last year he fled his country, where he endured persecution and torture. He first attempted to seek asylum in the U.S. in March of 2024, but was quickly deported to Guatemala. A month later, he tried to seek asylum in the U.S. again.",
      "As he made his way north, in Mexico he was held for ransom, raped and targeted for being gay, the migrant's court declaration states. In May of 2024, a U.S. asylum officer determined O.C.G. \"had a reasonable fear\" to return to Guatemala and was taken into immigration custody to see his case through.",
      "In February, an immigration judge determined O.C.G. would likely be persecuted if deported to his native Guatemala, and granted him a withholding of removal, court records show. Instead, he was placed on a bus to Mexico a few days later, without any notice.",
      "Mexican authorities told O.C.G. he could apply for asylum in Mexico, but they told him he \"would be kept locked up for the months it took to make a decision or I could just accept for them to take me back to Guatemala,\" his declaration states. Afraid to request asylum in Mexico after what he experienced there, O.C.G. opted to return to Guatemala. \"I had no safe options,\" he said.",
      "In another sealed declaration submitted to the court last week, O.C.G. reported \"living in constant fear of his attackers\" in Guatemala, \"being unable to leave the place where he is staying, not being able to rely on the police to protect him, and not being able to see his mother for fear of exposing her to violence, among other hardships,\" Murphy wrote in his order Friday.",
      "\u201cIn general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped,\u201d Murphy wrote in his 14-page decision.",
      "Friday's order marks the third time courts have instructed the Trump administration to bring back deportees found to have been improperly or illegally deported.",
      "Courts have already ordered the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Daniel Lozano-Camargo, both of whom were deported in March to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador. The Trump administration has not yet facilitated their return to the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. But on Saturday, the DOJ said in an X post that \"the court\u2019s orders in this case disrupt the president\u2019s ability to faithfully execute our immigration laws.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland also weighed in on the case in another X post Saturday, saying, O.C.G. \"was an illegally present alien who was granted withholding of removal to Guatemala. He was instead removed to Mexico, a safe third option for him, pending his asylum claim. Yet, this federal activist judge is ordering us to bring him back, so he can have an opportunity to prove why he should be granted asylum to a country that he has had no past connection to.\"",
      "Under U.S. and international laws, it is illegal to deport someone to a country where their life would be endangered.",
      "In his order denying DOJ's motion on Monday, Murphy wrote that administration officials \"have mischaracterized this Court\u2019s order, while at the same time manufacturing the very chaos they decry.\"",
      "The judge added that the Trump administration has repeatedly violated a preliminary injunction he put in place last month, requiring it provides written notices to both noncitizens and their counsel before any third-country deportations and gives them meaningful opportunities to raise fear-based claims.",
      "The administration failed to do this as recent as last week when it raced to deport eight people from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba and Mexico to South Sudan, Murphy wrote.",
      "Trina Realmuto of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, the organization providing legal representation to O.C.G. and three other plaintiffs in the same case, told NBC News in an email Tuesday: \"As the court found, this problem is one of the government\u2019s own making.\""

      "\u201cConsular sections will need to take into consideration the workload and resource requirements of each case prior to scheduling them going forward,\u201d the cable said, adding the priority should be on \u201cservices for U.S. citizens, immigrant visas, and fraud prevention.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how the prospective students\u2019 social media would be screened as part of the expanded vetting procedures. The public views and speech of international students have come under increased scrutiny during the Trump administration.",
      "The visas of thousands of students at college campuses nationwide have been revoked in recent weeks by the Trump administration, which says it must protect U.S. citizens from immigrants who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten national security or espouse hateful ideology.",

      "Many universities nationwide have warned international students about traveling abroad this summer, fearing many will not be allowed to return.",
      "The crackdown could also financially affect other universities with significant numbers of foreign students.",
      "The State Department had already instructed U.S. diplomats and consular officers to refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to its fraud prevention unit for mandatory social media checks under two executive orders known as Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats and Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/steve-kornacki-new-jersey-governor-race-democrat-county-machines-power-rcna209303",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 21:07:15 GMT",
    "summary": "In the New Jersey governor's race, Rep. Mikie Sherrill has racked up endorsements from county Democratic organizations, but their influence may be diminished.",
    "story": [
      "One metric has traditionally been all but definitive when it comes to New Jersey Democratic contests: the county line. And by that metric, one candidate is running circles around the others ahead of the June 10 gubernatorial primary: Rep. Mikie Sherrill.",
      "Sherrill has won endorsements from 10 of the state\u2019s 21 county Democratic organizations, including three of the four largest. Only two of the other five candidates in the race, Rep. Josh Gottheimer and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, have notched any county endorsements.",
      "The counties in which Sherrill has won support account for nearly 60% of all registered Democrats in the state. They include the county in which her 11th Congressional District is based, Morris, and the two others that it touches, Passaic and Essex. Gottheimer, whose 5th District is based in Bergen, also represents part of Passaic and Sussex. And Ras Baraka is the mayor of Newark, the largest city in Essex (and the state). Sweeney, the only candidate from South Jersey, has largely swept that region, where the county organizations typically act as a bloc.",
      "What has traditionally made these endorsements so meaningful is the preferred ballot position that came with them. An endorsed candidate would run at the top of the Democratic county organization\u2019s official line, an official-looking and impossible-to-miss column that would also include a host of familiar local names running for lower offices. Names of the other candidates would be listed by themselves, often in the far reaches of the ballot.",
      "The results were predictable: Candidates running off the line almost never won and generally got blown out. The last open Democratic gubernatorial primary was essentially settled a year before any votes were cast, when the largest county organizations threw their support to now-Gov. Phil Murphy.",
      "But a successful lawsuit last year and a new law signed by Murphy in March have changed the game. The line is gone and county parties can no longer list all of their endorsed candidates in a special column. Primary ballots now list candidates by the office they are seeking. One of the questions heading into June\u2019s primary is how much this has diminished the power of county endorsements.",
      "Sherrill has stuck with the traditional approach, aggressively cultivating them. Since her election to the House in 2018, when she flipped a Republican-held seat, she\u2019s been seen as a statewide prospect and developed relationships with party leaders and insiders. She won\u2019t enjoy the traditional benefits of running on the line, but the county organizations are still free to work on her behalf \u2014 no small matter in a state where machine politics are still practiced. And she\u2019ll get to display the slogan of each organization that is backing her next to her name on the ballot.",
      "But others are playing it differently, either only targeting specific counties (as Gottheimer, Sweeney and Baraka have) or skipping the entire process altogether, as Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop is.",
      "Some of this, of course, is simply a nod to the advantage Sherrill already had. Gottheimer found this out the hard way, when the organization in Hudson County, one of the biggest in the state, switched its allegiance from him to Sherrill. But Baraka and Fulop have tried to turn their lack of organizational support into a plus, hoping to tap into popular frustration with the machine style.",
      "This has all added up to an unusually muddled primary contest \u2014 at least until the past week, when two polls showed Sherrill separating herself from the pack. It could mean her heavy spending on television ads is paying off. But New Jersey\u2019s Democratic machines, no doubt, hope it\u2019s a sign that the old ways still work."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to make it easier for officials to deport convicted criminals to \"third countries\" that are not their countries of origin.",
      "The administration is seeking to block an injunction in which Massachusetts-based U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy said the affected immigrants nationwide should be given a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise concerns that they may be at risk of torture, persecution or death.",
      "Murphy later clarified that they should have at least 10 days to bring their claims.",
      "Just last week, he said the administration had violated his previous order by flying eight migrants to South Sudan. The men are now being held in a U.S. facility in Djibouti.",
      "All the immigrants potentially affected by the litigation are already subject to deportation but cannot be sent to their countries of origin, so the case hinges on what legal process they receive before they can be deported.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the new filing that Murphy's rulings require the government to undertake \"an onerous set of procedures\" that he had no authority to require.",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process. In addition to usurping the Executive\u2019s authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Trina Realmuto, a lawyer at the National Immigration Litigation Alliance who represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement that Murphy \"took limited and appropriate actions to ensure that people are afforded due process protections before the government can deport them to third countries.\"",
      "Murphy's original order in April concluded that plaintiffs were merely asking for basic due process.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are simply asking to be told they are going to be deported to a new country before they are taken to such a country, and be given an opportunity to explain why such a deportation will likely result in their persecution, torture, and/or death,\" he wrote.",
      "On Monday night, Murphy rejected a government attempt to reconsider his requirements as it relates to the men now in South Sudan.",
      "\u201cIt turns out that having immigration proceedings on another continent is harder and more logistically cumbersome than Defendants anticipated,\" he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt continues to be this Court\u2019s sincere hope that reason can get the better of rhetoric,\" he added."

      "LIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Images of a car plowing into a large crowd of soccer fans celebrating their team's English Premier League title win had barely made it to national newscasts when notorious right-wing voices started to call the incident a \"suspected terrorist attack\" on social media.",
      "The X account of Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster who is well known as the leader of the English far right, retweeted video of the vehicle knocking down people dressed in Liverpool Football Club\u2019s ketchup-red strip, writing that it looked \"very intentional.\" (The posts were labeled \"admin,\" a probable reference to the fact that Robinson did not write them himself since he was in prison at the time.)",
      "Others swiftly followed suit, opining that the driver had been motivated by Islamic extremism.",
      "Within a couple of hours, Merseyside Police released details on a suspect detained at the scene, describing him as a 53-year-old white British male from the Liverpool area. Officials also urged the public \u201cnot to speculate on the circumstances\u201d surrounding the incident. Within five hours, police had described the incident as \u201cisolated\u201d and not being investigated as terrorism-related.",
      "The release of these details by the British police, most notably the suspect\u2019s race, was remarkably fast.",
      "For many, it was a sign of lessons learned after the 2024 Southport stabbing attack, in which the same police force was pilloried for not sharing enough information soon enough and allowing rumors to run rampant. In this vacuum, speculation turned into calls for action, which soon bloomed into racist riots that rocked Britain in the aftermath of the deadly assault that killed three young girls, with more injured.",
      "In Southport, violent riots erupted last summer after false information shared on social media claimed the suspect in the stabbings was a radical Islamist migrant. Police were accused of failing to share accurate information on the suspect quickly enough, allowing rumors to circulate unchallenged.",

      "\u201cI think that was to dampen down some of the speculation from the far-right that sort of continues on X even as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that it appeared to be a lesson learned as a direct result of what happened after the Southport attack.",
      "In that case, he noted rumors swelled of the suspect being \u201can asylum seeker who arrived on a boat and it was a Muslim extremist \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said the suspect had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs.",
      "Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims separately said police believed the man arrested had been able to follow an ambulance responding to reports of a member of the public having a heart attack, after a road block was temporarily lifted.",
      "More than 50 people were initially taken to or showed up at hospitals for treatment, with children among those hurt. Eleven people remained in the hospital for ongoing treatment, but all appeared to be in \u201cstable condition\u201d and \u201crecovering well,\u201d police said.",
      "Lessons learned",
      "Darrin Hooper, who traveled with his wife from Maidstone, Kent, just over 30 miles southeast of London, to celebrate Liverpool's win, praised the police\u2019s quick response on the scene as well as on social media.",
      "\u201cIt was a good thing that they announced it straight away,\u201d he said  Tuesday as he stood among a crowd gathered on the edges of scene of Monday's incident, which had been cordoned off.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve just got to say it. And then it stops all the speculation,\u201d Hooper, 60, an electrical engineer, told NBC News.",
      "Sneha Venket, who traveled to the city with her husband, a major Liverpool F.C. fan, all the way from Cologne, Germany, to join in the parade, described the events that unfolded Monday as a \u201cvery bitter end to a very, very happy day.\u201d",
      "Recalling the grim events of last year in the eastern German city of Magdeburg, in which a 9-year-old child and four adults were killed after a car was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market,  Venket, 39, said she wasn\u2019t surprised to see speculation swirl in the aftermath of Monday\u2019s incident. In that case too, Europe\u2019s far right was quick to tap into fears around the deadly attack.",
      "Venket, who is studying screenwriting, said it was important to allow police to investigate before jumping to conclusions, but, she said, \u201cnowadays, it looks like society is more polarized than ever, every society.\u201d",

      "Loved and adored by their Latin fans and community, the two share with TODAY.com what makes their professional and personal relationship thrive \u2014 and why Caro doesn't feel the need to work with anyone else.",
      "\u201cWhen good things happen, you have to take advantage of them,\u201d Caro says of his working relationship with Su\u00e1rez. \u201cI believe when there\u2019s magic... (someone) being there for you in your personal and professional life, that\u2019s something to be applauded.\u201d",
      "He continues, \u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you think of someone else?\u2019 I say, \u2018But why should I chose someone else?\u2019\u201d",
      "Their latest comedy, \u201cSerpientes y Escaleras,\u201d follows Su\u00e1rez as Dora, the rigid yet determined prefect of a prestigious school. At first glance, she\u2019s a seemingly insignificant employee. But when she gets caught up in a family quarrel between two 8-year-old students and their pompous parents, it jeopardizes her lifelong dream of becoming school principal.",
      "\u201cI have the liberty of casting who I want to because I write the stories,\u201d Caro candidly says. \u201cAnd I have the privilege and am fortunate to have lifelong friends who I think are excellent performers.\u201d",
      "When asked why they work so well together, the two turn their heads towards each other and laugh.",
      "\u201cWho knows?\u201d says Su\u00e1rez, with Caro quipping, \u201cKarma. We must\u2019ve done something good in another life.\u201d",
      "Su\u00e1rez elaborates that whatever universe Caro creates, there is a clear understanding of their wants and needs on both sides.",
      "\u201cAnd then there\u2019s also a lot of confidence and the desire to take risks. And risks together, which makes you push yourself  a little further because when you do that with someone else,\u201d she says, \u201csiempre es lindo,\u201d which translates to, \u201cthat\u2019s always nice.\u201d",
      "The risk they take with \u201cSerpientes y Escaleras\u201d is asking people about their relationship and views on power, ambition and \u201cto what extent we are willing to go outside our ethical and moral frameworks.\u201d The title refers to people having the ability to be snakes climbing the ladder.",
      "\u201cEach person has different concepts of morality,\u201d Caro says, not just in life but on the show. \u201cPut that concept on the table, it starts a conversation \u2014 and that\u2019s what entertainment is about.\u201d",
      "When it comes to Su\u00e1rez's character, Dora, she is faced with having to keep the secrets of very powerful and very important figures. Using their actions and lies against them would put her life at risk \u2014 but it would also help her get her dream job.",
      "When Dora gets to a crossroad in her life, she faces a dilemma of doing what is right or what will benefit her.",
      "\u201cWhen she makes that decision,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says, \u201cIt brings a slew of changes in her personal and professional life and her family. It affects everything in her path and evidently changes and transforms her life and surroundings.\u201d",
      "While the show may deal with heavy topics about ethics and morals, the entertaining and choreographed title sequence is a great example of Caro\u2019s signature comical and creative touch. Su\u00e1rez\u2019s involvement is the cherry on top.",
      "\u201cIt sets the tone for the series,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you see the sequence in the first minutes of the show, one thinks, \u2018Well, now anything can happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "And that's just what fans expect from Caro and Su\u00e1rez's relationship."

      "Ahead of the docuseries release, Pulling tells TODAY.com that the docuseries will be a little different from \u201cDrive to Survive.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think when you see \u2018Driver to Survive,\u2019 (the F1 drivers are) at their pinnacle of the sport,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re in Formula 1. They\u2019re already established racing drivers. Whereas we\u2019re on that journey, we\u2019re on that progression path, and we\u2019re fighting to prove why we deserve to move up the ladder, one step closer to Formula 1.\u201d",
      "But just like \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d the drivers\u2019 personal lives are explored throughout the docuseries. Bianca Bustamante, another Academy driver featured in the show, tells TODAY.com that this aspect was challenging at times.",

      "She says she knows there are some people who will \u201cnever change their viewpoint\u201d on believing women are inferior in racing. But since the Academy\u2019s inception, she thinks a lot of people are starting to see and believe in women\u2019s potential in motorsport.",

      "While being in front of the camera can be \u201cquite a scary place\u201d for some of the drivers, Pulling says it shows the reality of what goes on and off the grid.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making mistakes. We\u2019re still at parts of our career where the F1 drivers were making mistakes, but they didn\u2019t have a show made about it and they weren\u2019t as watched as closely,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite intimidating in that aspect, as it\u2019s a lot, but I think it will only help in showing breaking that stigma and seeing the work we\u2019re putting in off the track,\u201d she adds.",
      "Bustamante hopes that the series \u201cresonates\u201d with fans.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few of us featured in the storyline, all different drivers with all different histories and trajectories and all in different stages of our lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I hope (viewers) find someone they resonate with \u2014 whether it be a hero story of them coming from this or that, experiencing the same issues in life \u2014 and they take away a lesson of some sort from our experiences. And not just that, but to also champion the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about passing the torch a little bit brighter, to give them a bit more insight,\u201d she adds, noting that they are all still rookies trying to make a name for themselves."

    "summary": "What happens in the series finale of The Handmaid's Tale? Read on for a recap.",
    "story": [
      "The book on Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is now closed. After 66 episodes strung out over eight years, following the adventures of titular Handmaid Offred/June (Elisabeth Moss), the series ended Tuesday night with some happy endings, some shocking tragedies \u2014 and some hope for the future. June has faced all three.",
      "But how to wrap up this story? Over the seasons we went from June\u2019s ordeal as the forced Handmaid to an infertile couple in a theocratic society called Gilead (made up of much of the former United States), to her rebellion, escape and vengeance, all while never vowing to abandon her daughter Hannah, who had been taken from her.",
      "It\u2019s a lot to conclude on, given that it would be hard to imagine a satisfying ending that didn\u2019t end with the complete overthrow of Gilead. But the series, whose final episode was called \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d stuck the landing with a shocking penultimate episode last week (\"Execution\") and a finale (\"The Handmaid's Tale\") that tied up some loose ends \u2014 while also laying the groundwork for the sequel series, \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d set to air in the near future.",
      "So let\u2019s go back and see just how \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d concluded its tale \u2014 and as ever, blessed is the fruit.",
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead!",
      "Why was 'Execution' such a big deal?",
      "The series\u2019 final episode was important, but a lot of it served as epilogue and a place to get some closure for our favorite performers.",
      "Last week\u2019s episode, \u201cExecution,\u201d was arguably the true climax of the series \u2014 in which multiple characters, including June, Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) and Joseph (Bradley Whitford) conspired to put a bomb on a plane carrying key Commanders.",
      "Not only did it take out many of the most important of Gilead\u2019s leaders, Joseph (who carried the explosive) and Nick (Max Minghella) were also on the plane. Instantly, Gilead\u2019s threat was dealt a mortal blow, if not entirely neutralized.",
      "What happened to June in the final episode?",
      "June\u2019s role in this epilogue-esque episode was more to report on what came after the plane exploded: United States jets invaded Gilead, bombing Boston and liberating the state \u2014 then spreading to other states, though not eliminating the theocracy entirely.",
      "June also underwent a lot of catharsis \u2014 burning her Handmaid\u2019s robe in a street bonfire; meeting up with her mother Holly (Cherry Jones); who journeyed from Alaska with baby Nichole; and trying to figure out her future. She wasn\u2019t abandoning locating Hannah, primarily, and we saw both flashbacks and dream sequences involving the little girl she had with Luke (O-T Fagbenle). But more than one character suggested she should write her experiences in a book for future generations, and to honor those who supported her along the way.",
      "Will Luke and June stay together?",
      "They clearly love one another, but they now have different ideas of how to fight the remnants of Gilead. June tells Nichole that she will have to leave her with her grandmother again, to help free all the girls in danger in Gilead \u2014 though we also know that this means tracking down Hannah. Luke, on the other hand, wants to be more involved with guerilla fighting. They share a warm, caring moment together that is also not physical before agreeing that they will meet again somewhere, sometime.",
      "As June told her mother, \u201cFighting may not get us everything, but we don\u2019t have a choice because not fighting is what got us Gilead in the first place. And Gilead doesn\u2019t need to be beaten \u2014 it needs to be broken.\u201d",
      "What about other key characters?",
      "Emily (Alexis Bledel): The former professor and June\u2019s original shopping partner became allies, and after escape Emily started a family in Canada. But she fell off the radar \u2014 until turning up in Boston, outside a former ice cream parlor, startling June. She and June took a stroll along the Charles, past where Handmaids used to be strung up and now features hanged Guardians, and they reflected on the changes in their lives. \u201cRage is a gift from God; it\u2019s meant to be shared with the most deserving,\u201d Emily told June.",
      "Serena: Now a stateless refuge, Serena is last seen in a shelter with her newborn Noah, telling him he\u2019s all she needs. It\u2019s a kind of happily-ever-after, but she\u2019s been stripped of all status and societal respect at this stage.",
      "Janine (Madeline Brewer): A longtime Handmaid compatriot of June's, Janine underwent some of the worst torments of the series, including losing her eye. Her baby ended up with Naomi (Ever Carradine) and Joseph\u2019s family, but in a surprise revelation, both Janine and her child were handed off\u00a0by Naomi and Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) to conquering U.S. representatives \u2014 and June, who was brought along as a \u201cfamiliar face.\u201d",
      "Moira (Samira Wiley): Alas, while Moira is seen here and there in the episode, there's no warm farewell or wrap-up to June's most loyal best friend.",
      "What happens next for June \u2014 and the world of \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019?",
      "June is certainly going to keep fighting. But she might have a project in mind, first: a memoir. After both Luke and Holly urge her to write about her experiences, the last scenes of the show featured June returning to the Waterford house, which is standing empty and partially burned. She went upstairs to her old garret and stood in front of the window where we first saw her in the Handmaid\u2019s outfit.",
      "She pulled out a recording device and started speaking, outlining the furniture in the room and the window, noting it\u2019s not a means of escape. Where would a Handmaid go, after all? But in a nice touch, those are the same words she spoke in the very first episode (they\u2019re also very similar to some of the first words in the original book by Margaret Atwood). Only now, as we saw June triumphant over not just her circumstances but the entirety of Gilead, the words had a lot more meaning. She was taking control of her story \u2014 and she was far from being done writing it at the same time.",
      "How does the finale set up 'The Testaments'?",
      "As for \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d the next series in the \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d world, it will be based on Atwood\u2019s 2019 novel, set 15 years in the future from the end of \u201cTale.\u201d Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) will be the new narrator of the story and focus on a woman named Agnes in Gilead and Daisy, a woman in Canada. Atwood\u2019s book has specific secrets to be revealed about both women, but it\u2019s not known if the series will also head in that direction."

      "The Robertson family announced his death on various social media channels on Sunday, May 25.",
      "\"We celebrate today that our father, husband, and grandfather, Phil Robertson, is now with the Lord,\" the family wrote in a Facebook post on Phil Robertson's official page.",
      "Phil Robertson was a hunter and businessman who founded the Duck Commander duck call business in West Monroe, Louisiana. He is best known as the bearded patriarch of the close-knit Robertson family featured in the reality series \"Duck Dynasty,\" which ran for 11 seasons on A&E.",
      "Phil Robertson cause of death",
      "The family did not immediately specify Phil Robertson's cause of death. However, Phil Robertson's family had previously opened up about his multiple health issues, including a neurodegenerative disease and blood disorder.",
      "Alzheimer's diagnosis and blood disease",
      "Last December, Phil Robertson's son Jase Robertson revealed that his father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Jase Robertson, 55, announced that his father was in the \"early stages\" of Alzheimer's during an episode of the \u201cUnashamed with the Robertson Family\" podcast that aired on Dec. 6.",
      "Alzheimer's is a progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, according to the National Institute on Aging. Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia among older adults, and it affects an estimated 6 million-plus Americans, most of whom are 65 or older.",
      "Jase Robertson said on the Dec. 6 podcast episode that his father's memory was \"not what it once was.\"",
      "Memory problems, such as forgetting recent events or conversations, are typically the first signs of Alzheimer\u2019s, per the Mayo Clinic. Over time, as Alzheimer\u2019s worsens, it causes a loss of cognitive functioning, which interferes with daily life.",
      "In addition to Alzheimer's, Phil Robertson was also dealing with an unnamed blood disorder. \u201cWe were trying to figure out the diagnosis, but according to the doctors, they are sure that he has some sort of blood disease that\u2019s causing all kinds of problems,\" Jase Robertson said.",

      "Despite his desire to return to work, Phil Robertson had to take a break from the podcast due to his health problems. \u201cI'm like, 'Well, Phil, you can barely walk around without crying out in pain,\u2019\u201d Jase Robertson recalled telling his father.",
      "There is no cure for Alzheimer's, but treatments can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.",

      "\u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d debuted in 2012 and ran until 2017. The series followed the lives of the Robertson clan as they ran their duck hunting business. During its 11-season run, it was one of the most-watched reality shows on cable television. It also faced some controversy.",
      "In 2013, Phil Robertson faced criticism for making controversial remarks about homosexuality and racism. The head of the family was briefly suspended from the show by A&E, but later returned.",

      "Dolly Parton credits her Tennessee roots and southern family upbringing for who she is today.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about her new line of frozen meals, recipes inspired by the ones she ate growing up, Parton says her mom gave her one particular phrase to live by that always stuck with her: \u201cTo thine own self be true.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of meaning in that phrase,\u201d Parton says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always tried to stay true to me. And always, when people ask me for advice, that\u2019s kind of what I tell them.\u201d",

      "\u201cFind out who you are and do it on purpose. And do it with purpose,\u201d Parton advises. \u201cYou got to know who you are because so many people try to emulate or copy somebody else.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo they think they have to do a certain thing a certain way, but you really need to do things your way, according to your rules, your personality, your mindset, your faith,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s most important to find out what you really want, what your values and principles really are, and not try to be like somebody else.\u201d",
      "During her interview with TODAY.com, Parton acknowledges life is full of sacrifices, but she counsels, \u201cDon\u2019t ever sacrifice who you are, your principles and your morals and your values to just try to get ahead in business. It ain\u2019t worth it.\u201d",
      "For Parton, embracing this authenticity not only comes out in her character, music and business decisions, but also in her legendary style.",
      "Though the country icon claims she\u2019s \u201cnever been locked in\u201d to one particular style, she says the \u201clook\u201d she\u2019s most known for \u201ccame from the fact that I\u2019m not a true beauty.\u201d",
      "\"There are some people just born beautiful, and then if they add more stuff, they're just more beautiful. But then there are people, like me, that you just try to make the most of what you got,\" Parton says. \"I'm not tall. I'm never going to be like a supermodel, so I like to wear my high heels.\"",
      "\u201cMy hair, I used to try to tease it to make it all it was, and with the bleach and all that, I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019m gonna start wearing wigs,\u2019\u201d she continues, adding that she keeps her natural hair the same length and color.",
      "Just like her personal philosophy, Parton says she always intends for her style to represent her most \u201cauthentic self.\u201d She says her clothing choices bring out a more \u201coutgoing and more friendly and more accessible\u201d version of herself.",
      "\"I've had people through the years say, 'Oh, we need to tone it down. Nobody will ever take you serious looking like that because you look like trash.' I said, 'Well, I was influenced by the trash in my hometown. So I'm not trash, but I like that trashy look.' And I just like that Frederick's of Hollywood, you know, that glamor girl kind of look. And that never went away.\"",
      "\u201cSo I never thought that I had to change it just because somebody else said I would,\u201d she adds. \u201cI only change anything because I say it.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe Last of Us\u201d Season 2 ends on a major cliffhanger that puts in jeopardy the life of one of our most important characters: Ellie.",
      "To recap how we got here: Having seen Joel beaten to death by Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), the daughter of a surgeon Joel killed at the hospital, Ellie spends the season vowing revenge. She tries to rustle up a posse to follow Abby and her gang to exact that vengeance but gets only her friend Dina (Isabela Merced) to back her up. And so they set out to Seattle, where Abby and her Washington Liberation Front are stationed.",
      "Once there, a lot unfolds. Dina and Ellie acknowledge their romantic love for each other; Dina turns out to be pregnant; Ellie learns the personal cost of vengeance as she tracks the WLF pack and intentionally or accidentally takes them out. We meet Isaac (Jeffrey Wright), who back in the day took out his FEDRA unit and changed teams to lead the WLF, and who now holds Abby in great regard as his presumptive successor.",
      "We also learn that the cordyceps fungi have evolved and gotten smarter (the infected can now hide out even in freezing temperatures, and \u201ctalk\u201d to one another). Not only that, but in a lower basement in one of Seattle\u2019s hospitals their spores have festered and become airborne, making the contagion exponentially more dangerous.",
      "But it\u2019s this final episode of Season 2 that truly shatters everything: It\u2019s Day 3 in Seattle, and Tommy (Gabriel Luna) and Jesse (Young Mazino) ride to the rescue of Ellie and Dina, who\u2019s recovering from a crossbow arrow injury. Ellie, shaken by what she did to the WLF pack members (one who Ellie accidentally shot was pregnant), agrees to leave town and live without taking down Abby \u2014 until Abby tracks them down at a theater where they\u2019ve been hanging out. Abby kills Jesse and injures Tommy, then takes aim at Ellie, who insists that she\u2019s the one Abby wants, not Tommy.",
      "\u201cI let you live,\u201d Abby tells Ellie. \u201cAnd you wasted it.\u201d We hear a gunshot \u2014 and the screen goes to black.",
      "But the episode doesn\u2019t end there: We flash back to Day 1 in Seattle. Abby is awoken for a meeting and goes out onto a balcony, looking down into a sports stadium (likely Lumen Field) at a combination community/military base before she heads off to a meeting.",
      "Does Ellie die in \u2018The Last of Us\u2019 video game?",
      "Short answer: No. Ellie lives, but is left scarred physically and mentally, and ultimately appears to lose everything she once valued.",
      "Longer answer: Season 2 of \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d actually already showed us how the game \u201cThe Last of Us Part II\u201d ended \u2014 with Ellie\u2019s memory of speaking to Joel on his front porch, and her saying she\u2019d like to try and forgive him for what he did at that hospital. This only comes after the main gameplay has ended.",

      "\ud83d\udea8 There\u2019s at least one more season in the works for this HBO series, so avoid the following if you don\u2019t want to be spoiled.",
      "Season 2 of the series seems to be leaving audiences off toward the end of \u201cPart II,\u201d in which Abby has more connections to the Seraphite cult, and betrays WLF to save one member of that cult. When she finds some of the WLF members dead thanks to Ellie, she tracks her down to the hideout and shoots Tommy, then beats up Ellie and Dina \u2014 but ultimately spares them.",
      "But that\u2019s not the end of \u201cPart II\u201d \u2014 after that beating, there\u2019s a time jump in which Ellie and Dina live on a farm, raising Dina and Jesse\u2019s son. Tommy tells them where Abby is these days, and Ellie goes out on one final mission. They get into a fight, and Abby takes off two of Ellie\u2019s fingers. Ellie nearly drowns Abby, but thinks of Joel \u2014 and spares her. When Ellie returns to the farmhouse, it\u2019s empty, and she again thinks of Joel and how he saved her life back at the Salt Lake City hospital.",
      "Who\u2019s dead and who\u2019s still alive by the end of Season 2?",
      "There are a lot of deaths in Season 2, especially after the cordyceps zombies storm the fort. But focusing on the most important characters, the dead include Joel and Jesse; plus WLF crew members Nora (Tati Gabrielle), Manny (Danny Ramirez), Owen (Spencer Lord) and Mel (Ariela Barer).",
      "Ellie is almost certainly not dead, all evidence and screen-cuts to the contrary. Probably neither is Abby. They still have final reckonings with one another yet to accomplish, according to the video game. Meanwhile, Dina is pregnant and injured, but should survive. We also finally saw the importance of Eugene\u2019s (Joe Pantoliano) exit, and how it led to a massive break between Ellie and Joel.",
      "Most everyone else you can think of lives \u2026 at least for now."

    "story": [
      "When Robyn Hurder takes the stage in Broadway\u2019s \u201cSmash,\u201d she portrays the dream role of Marilyn Monroe \u2014 sort of.",
      "In the Broadway production inspired by the 2012 NBC drama of the same name, Hurder plays Ivy Lynn, a musical theater darling tackling the role of a lifetime in the fictional show \u201cBombshell.\u201d Ivy is introduced as a beloved leader of the still developing production, fostering friendly rapport with everyone from her understudy, Karen (Caroline Bowman), to director Nigel (Brooks Ashmanskas). But as the pressure of portraying an icon increases, her grip on reality declines, and she goes full method.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve loved Marilyn my entire life. She\u2019s been such an influence in my career on Broadway. The roles I play, I always put some of her into it, into any role I originate,\u201d Hurder tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut actually playing her is, obviously, it\u2019s intimidating, because she is the icon of icons.",
      "\u201cSo what made it easier for me to approach it is: I am Robyn Hurder, who\u2019s playing Ivy Lynn, who\u2019s playing Marilyn Monroe,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cSmash\u201d aims to give a behind-the-scenes look at how a Broadway production is made, portraying the heightened dramatics expected of musical theater. The opening number, \u201cLet Me Be Your Star,\u201d features Hurder singing in costume as Marilyn, before the perspective shifts, showing Hurder as Ivy rehearsing in a studio surrounded by backup dancers, writers and the show\u2019s producer.",
      "In addition to Hurder and Bowman, \u201cSmash\u2019s\u201d main characters are actors playing the creative forces at work behind the scenes, like co-writers Tracy (Krysta Rodriguez) and Jerry (John Behlmann) and director\u2019s assistant Chloe (Bella Coppola).",
      "It\u2019s a similar format to the original show \u201cSmash,\u201d which starred Megan Hilty as Ivy, Katharine McPhee as Karen, as well as Debra Messing and Christian Borle as \u201cBombshell\u2019s\u201d writers and Angelica Huston as the show\u2019s producer.",
      "But it's a very different style. Instead of following Ivy and Karen's battle to play Marilyn and other interpersonal melodramatic dynamics, the Broadway show goes full tilt comedy.",
      "Bowman, calling the production an entry into the \u201c\u2018Smash\u2019 multiverse,\u201d is confident that the differences will appeal to even the most dedicated superfan of the original show, which has achieved an almost cult-like legacy since its cancellation after Season 2.",
      "\u201cI do feel like if those cult followers came to see this musical, and if they do give it a chance, they\u2019re going to be really pleasantly surprised,\u201d Bowman says.",
      "\u201cThe way the show took itself too seriously and then didn\u2019t take itself too seriously \u2014 we do the same thing,\" she adds. \"We don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously, and we lean into the funny elements that everybody kind of laughed at on the TV show.\u201d",
      "Making a Musical About a Musical",
      "Joshua Bergasse, who choreographed both the 2012 show and the Broadway production, says the original idea for NBC\u2019s \u201cSmash\u201d was, \u201cWe\u2019ll do one season, and then we\u2019ll have the show within the show, and that show will then move to Broadway.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, it actually took 14 years to make the first one come to Broadway,\u201d Bergasse adds with a laugh.",
      "Bergasse says part of why a Broadway production of \u201cBombshell\u201d \u2014 the musical about the life of Marilyn Monroe within the \u201cSmash\u201d storyline \u2014 didn\u2019t work is because the part of Marilyn would be simply too demanding.",
      "The \u201cSmash\u201d musical uses the same songs from the 2012 show, many of which are energetic, dance-heavy, blockbuster numbers, like \u201c20th Century Fox Mambo\u201d and \u201cThe National Pastime.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhoever played Marilyn would literally play one performance then probably die because she would have to do too much,\u201d Bergasse says.",
      "The show-within-a-show format offered a solution to that problem, with the Monroe numbers being performed by Ivy, Karen and even Chloe at one point.",
      "When it came to choreographing the show, Bergasse, who won an Emmy for his work on \u201cSmash\u201d and now is nominated for a 2025 Tony Award for best choreography, says he looked back at the TV series and \u201creinvented\u201d memorable moments for the stage. \u201cCut, Print... Moving On\u201d is now used to show the staccato pacing of rehearsals. \u201c20th Century Fox Mambo\u201d occurs as a backdrop to show the passage of time, Ivy\u2019s continuing descent into Marilyn madness and Karen\u2019s potential to take over the lead role.",
      "And as Bergasse was choreographing and developing the musical, the writers were taking notes. While the script was in development, Bergasse provided feedback on how the dialogue of a Broadway rehearsal would actually go.",
      "\"I would say to the writers, 'Guys, I would never say that,'\" Bergasse says with a laugh.",
      "\u201cI was just happy that it makes sense,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo all my dancer and choreographer friends will come and say, \u2018Oh, yeah, that\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d",
      "Bowman says the real-life actors also played a role in the show's creation, albeit unintentionally.",
      "\u201cI felt like the writers, too, kind of were really listening to conversations that we were having, because then suddenly, like lines would show up in the script and we\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh my gosh. That was said in rehearsal yesterday,\u2019\u201d Bowman said.",
      "When it came to preparing for the part, Hurder says playing Ivy took some of the pressure off as she donned Marilyn\u2019s iconic blond curls and white halter dress. She says she watched Monroe\u2019s movies, read biographies, and studied her mannerisms and speech patterns.",
      "\u201cPlaying Ivy Lynn, I\u2019m just being myself. Like when people see that, they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re Robyn,\u2019\u201d Hurder says.",
      "\u201cSo I kind of apply Robyn into Ivy, and then I did what Robyn would do,\" she adds. \"... I did not want to do an impression. I just want to honor (Marilyn Monroe) in the most authentic way.\u201d",
      "In the story of the show, as Ivy\u2019s method acting approach goes south, the creative team can't agree on how to tell the story of an icon. From the beginning, the show\u2019s writers insist they don\u2019t want to tell the sob story of Monroe; rather, they want to celebrate her status as legend. But as they write more songs and opening night barrels closer, they end up with emotional ballads, and the narrative arc bends toward tragedy.",
      "\u201cA lot of this stuff is stuff that happens \u2014 it\u2019s a little exaggerated for dramatical purposes, but it\u2019s not far off,\u201d Bergasse says. \u201cLots of times you create something, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a minute that is not what I meant to do.\u2019",
      "\u201cWhen Jerry says at the end, \u2018How did we do everything exactly the opposite of what we meant to do?\u2019 You know, that happens,\u201d he adds.",
      "Updating a Cult Favorite",
      "When Hurder got the audition for Ivy, she went back to re-watch the 2012 show, 12 years later, and she \u201creally, really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "But she adds, \"We can't take that TV show and put it on stage in 2025. We had to change it. They wanted to make it a comedy, and we need to laugh right now.\"",
      "The script is notably different, including how it portrays the nature of Ivy and Karen's relationship. Instead of the perpetual chorus girl going up against the naive Broadway newbie, Ivy is a beloved veteran of the stage and Karen is her longtime friend and understudy.",
      "Like Hurder, Bowman says Karen \u201cfeels very close to who I am as a human.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know what it feels like to cover a star,\u201d says Bowman, who before \u201cSmash,\u201d was the standby for Norma Desmond in \u201cSunset Boulevard.\u201d \u201cI have been a swing and understudy, a standby, a principal, supporting and leading lady.

In that case too, Europe\u2019s far right was quick to tap into fears around the deadly attack.",

      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling,\" he said in the speech, switching between English and French.",
      "The country faces another \"critical moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values that Canadians hold dear and one which the government is determined to protect,\" Charles said. \"The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada\u2019s relationships with partners is also changing.\"",
      "Charles said Carney and Trump \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship,\u201d adding that it was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "Charles, still undergoing cancer treatment, is the nonpartisan head of state in Canada \u2014 a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies \u2014 but he did not write the speech. Instead, he read what was presented to him by Canada\u2019s government in the country\u2019s capital, Ottawa.",
      "Among them was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wore green and orange sneakers with his suit.",
      "\"Every time I come to Canada, a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart,\" Charles said. \"I\u2019ve always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.\"",
      "Concluding his speech, Charles praised Canada as a \"force for good\" in the world.",
      "\"As the anthem reminds us: The true north is indeed strong and free,\" he said, earning a round of applause from lawmakers.",
      "Before the speech, Charles was taken to the Senate of Canada Building in a horse-drawn carriage with Queen Camilla. There, he received the Royal Salute from the 100-person guard of honor from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment before he entered the chamber.",
      "Charles also met Monday with Carney and Mary Simon, Canada's first Indigenous governor general, who is the king\u2019s representative to the country.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the royal family, and it is rare for the monarch to deliver what is known as the Speech from the Throne. The last time was in 1977, when Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, read it for only the second time in her 70-year reign.",
      "But Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said in a statement Monday that Charles\u2019 visit spoke \u201cto the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify.\u201d",
      "It was a change in tone from earlier this month, when he criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against Trump\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since he took office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left the U.K. trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Charles has also made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Even so, Carney this month told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, that Canadians \u201cweren\u2019t impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s invitation to the palace.",
      "\u201cIt was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",

      "Harvard has sued over the move, calling it unlawful, and on Friday a federal judge in Boston put it on hold for two weeks. If the Trump administration prevails, new international students would be barred from enrolling at Harvard while current ones would be forced to either transfer elsewhere or lose their legal status.",
      "U.S. universities including Harvard rely heavily on international students, who often pay far more in tuition than their American classmates. Many of them end up staying in the U.S., where they have been responsible for major breakthroughs in strategically important fields such as artificial intelligence where the U.S., China and other nations are locked in intense competition.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign against Harvard is a \u201cterrible policy error\u201d that could undermine the world-leading role the U.S. has played in research and development since World War II, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "A downturn in international students would affect American universities\u2019 \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d and income, while benefiting U.S. competitors, he said. \u201cChina will become significantly more attractive than before to students and researchers from the Global South,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWestern Europe will also gain significantly.\u201d",
      "There was already growing unease among international students at U.S. universities amid anti-immigrant rhetoric by Trump, in addition to deep funding cuts and efforts to intervene in universities\u2019 internal operations. Hundreds of students\u2019 visas have been revoked, while the Trump administration has detained and sought to deport others over pro-Palestinian and other activism.",
      "At Harvard, more than a quarter of the student body of about 25,000 comes from overseas and the looming ban has caught up students from more than 140 countries, including the future queen of Belgium.",
      "Harvard\u2019s biggest group of overseas students, about 20%, come from China, which was long the top source of international students in the U.S. before being overtaken by India last year.",
      "The number of Chinese students in the U.S. has been dropping \u2014to about 277,000 during the 2023-24 school year, compared with more than 372,000 in 2019-20 \u2014 due to disruptions from the Covid pandemic as well as growing U.S.-China tensions.",
      "Chinese academics were also driven away by the China Initiative, a national security program from Trump\u2019s first term that drew accusations of racial profiling. Many of them have moved their research to Chinese universities.",
      "Responding to the Harvard ban, Beijing said U.S.-China educational cooperation is \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d and that it would \u201csafeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars overseas.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina has consistently opposed the politicization of educational exchanges,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Friday. \u201cSuch actions by the U.S. will only damage its own image and international credibility.\u201d",
      "Izzy Shen, 23, an incoming Harvard student from Beijing, said her  visa application was refused hours after Trump\u2019s Harvard ban.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so fast,\u201d said Shen, whose application had already been marked \u201capproved.\u201d",
      "Shen, who was admitted to Harvard\u2019s Master in Design Engineering program, said she remained \u201crelatively optimistic\u201d and that the situation would \u201cget clearer\u201d after the injunction hearing Thursday.",
      "Duo Yi, who was admitted to the public policy doctoral program at Harvard Kennedy School, said she is now exploring other options amid growing uncertainty about her enrolment. Trump is \u201csimply too unpredictable,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no way of knowing what direction his future policies will take.\u201d",
      "Foreign governments and universities are not waiting to woo the Harvard students spurned by Trump. In the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, officials have urged universities to take proactive action \u201cto attract top talent.\u201d",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cdoors are wide open\u201d to \u201cany students who face discrimination and unfair treatment in the U.S.,\u201d John Lee, the city\u2019s top leader, said Tuesday.",
      "Hong Kong has four universities in the top 100 of U.S. News & World Report\u2019s Best Global Universities Rankings, which is topped by Harvard, though experts say academic freedom in the former British colony of 7.5 million people has eroded since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020.",
      "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said Friday that Harvard undergraduates and postgraduates, as well as students with confirmed offers of admission, were welcome to study there instead.",
      "Europe has also sought to lure scientists worried about funding cuts and freedom of research under Trump, launching a $570 million initiative this month called \u201cChoose Europe.\u201d",
      "Though she did not mention Trump by name, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized \u201cfree and open research\u201d in a speech promoting the initiative at Sorbonne University in Paris.",
      "\u201cAs threats rise across the world, Europe will not compromise on its principles,\u201d she said. \u201cEurope must remain the home of academic and scientific freedom.\u201d",
      "Despite concerns about the Harvard ban, Alex Zeng, an overseas education consultant based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, said American universities remained the top choice for many Chinese students.",
      "\u201cThe rich still want to go to the U.S. for education,\u201d Zeng said."

      "\u201cYou have to walk. Just walk. And you have to walk quickly because at any time bombs and shots are going to be there,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview this month. \u201cAt one point I thought: \u2018It\u2019s OK. You lose the baby, but you will be alive with your family. You\u2019ll be safe with your husband, so God will give it to you again,\u2019\u201d she added.",
      "But as they trekked south, she said they lost contact with her 63-year-old father, who had fallen behind. After four days of frantic backtracking, she said they discovered he had been arrested at an RSF checkpoint and accused of stealing his own belongings.",
      "\u201cWe were all very scared,\u201d she said, adding that they feared he might be shot. \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t eat for a long time,\u201d she said. Around the same time she found out that her brother, who had decided to stay home, had been seriously wounded in a rocket attack, she said.",
      "After 35 days in captivity, Abdelrahman said her father was released. Although he had cholera and malaria, he was relatively unharmed, she said. Her brother survived surgery despite almost losing a leg.",
      "Abdelrahman moved with the rest of her family farther south to Jazirah state, where she gave birth to her daughter, Samiya, now 16 months old.",
      "\u201cEveryone was in tears, my mom, me and dad, just a moment full of joy, and I just felt lucky, and I felt blessed that God helped me and protected her,\u201d said Abdelrahman, who is now teaching English in the eastern city of Kassala.",

      "On Oct. 5, 2023, as bullets ripped into his apartment and rockets exploded nearby, he said he hid under his bed. When he emerged, he said eight or nine RSF members had surrounded him and asked if he was a member of the military.",
      "Refusing to believe he was a civilian, Ali said they started \u201cbeating me like crazy.\u201d Accusing him of being in the military, he said they \u201cwere just pointing guns at my face, shooting it next to my ears, next to my feet\u201d and threatening to kill him.",

      "He said he could smell \u201cweed and alcohol\u201d on the breath of the fighters who hit him with pipes and sticks and threatened to shoot him in mock executions. The beatings only stopped at night after other RSF fighters complained about the screaming because they were trying to sleep, Ali added.",
      "After 10 days, Ali said he was allowed to contact his family who provided evidence that he was a civilian. This, he said, led to a complete change in attitude from his captors, who took him somewhere for a shower and gave him new clothes.

      "\u201cPresident Trump is a man who wants results,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in Turkey, claiming that Trump's efforts were being \u201csabotaged\u201d by some European countries as he referred to ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "Lavrov did not provide further details on the exchange and the State Department did not immediately respond to NBC News' requests for comment.",
      "Russia has maintained that it wants to end the war in Ukraine, which began when Putin launched an invasion in 2022, but has not backed away from its maximalist demands that Ukraine essentially disarm and hand over vast swaths of territory.",
      "If the deal is confirmed by the State Department and comes to fruition, it will be the first exchange since last month, when a Russian-American woman, former-ballerina Ksenia Karelina, was freed after being imprisoned for treason by Russia. She was released in exchange for Russian national Arthur Petrov, the State Department said at the time.",
      "That followed the return of American teacher Marc Fogel in February, after he spent 3\u00bd years in prison for a minor medical cannabis infraction. Going the other way in that exchange was convicted money launderer Alexander Vinnik.",
      "And that swap came after the massive deal in which four U.S. residents wrongly imprisoned in Russia \u2014 including journalist Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan \u2014 were released last August as part of a multinational prisoner exchange the likes of which had not been seen since the Cold War.",
      "The large and complex deal, cut among seven nations, involved 24 people, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens held in Russia, and eight Russians imprisoned in the U.S., Germany, Slovenia, Norway and Poland.",
      "The deal would mark the latest twist in the complicated relationship between Trump and Putin.",
      "The two have long shared an obvious rapport, meeting on multiple occasions and exchanging warm words during Trump's first term. But tensions have been mounting, with Trump seeking to end the war in Ukraine \u2014 something he promised to accomplish within the first 24 hours of his second term \u2014 and Russia resisting those efforts.",
      "With relations between the White House and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warming recently \u2014 a large critical minerals deal and praise for Trump from the Ukrainian leader helped smooth things over after the two leaders' extraordinary Oval Office showdown this year \u2014 Putin's star may have fallen in Washington.",
      "Trump on Sunday wrote on Truth Social that Putin \u201chas gone absolutely CRAZY!\u201d and is \u201cneedlessly killing a lot of people\u201d after Russia unleashed a massive aerial assault on Ukraine on Saturday with drones and missiles targeting more than 30 cities and villages.",
      "The attacks came even as Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange of hundreds of soldiers and civilians, in the largest such swap in the three-year war so far. The deal was agreed upon during talks in Istanbul earlier this month, but those talks failed to reach a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Trump, who has shifted U.S. policy direction from outright supporting Ukraine to considering Russia\u2019s account of the war, had warned he would tighten sanctions on Russia if a peace deal isn\u2019t reached. But he appeared to back off his warning last week when he declined to impose additional sanctions on Moscow for not agreeing to an immediate pause in fighting.",

      "The European Union has pushed back against President Donald Trump\u2019s latest suggestion that he will impose a 50% import tariff on all E.U. goods, warning that trans-Atlantic trade must be built on \u201crespect, not threats.\u201d",
      "The rebuke came after Trump said in a Friday post on his Truth Social platform that trade negotiations with Brussels were \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d and suggested he would slap a 50% blanket duty on all European goods entering the U.S. starting June 1.",
      "But on Sunday, Trump announced that the new date for the tariff to go into effect would be July 9, after he said Ursula Von Der Leyden \u2014 president of the European Commission \u2014 called him and requested he push back the date.",
      "It was just the latest bellicose remark from Trump and came amid a broader souring of relations between the two global powers that has seen months of distrust and economic sparring.",
      "The E.U., home to nearly 450 million people, is the world\u2019s largest trading bloc and one of Washington\u2019s top commercial partners. It exported more than $600 billion in goods to the U.S. last year while importing goods worth around $370 billion.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest broadside follows his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement of a 39% tariff on European goods, an idea he later walked back before he changed course again Friday with an even tougher stance.",
      "Stephen Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, told the BBC that his former boss was expressing his frustration with the E.U.",
      "\u201cI think he was hoping that by now we would have the E.U. coming with some kind of deal on the table, and so far that hasn\u2019t come,\u201d he said, calling the 50% import tariffs a \u201cshot at the bow.\u201d",

      "While the E.U.\u2019s response signals a willingness to negotiate, discord has deepened between the bloc and its longtime trans-Atlantic ally over a return to the combative stance Trump took during his first administration, when he flew in the face of decades of cooperation and cast the E.U. as an economic rival.",
      "In 2018, Trump said \u201cnobody treats us much worse than the European Union\u201d and argued the bloc was designed to exploit the U.S. He repeated that claim this year, describing the E.U. as being \u201cformed in order to screw the United States.\u201d",
      "While the ideological architects of Trump's first administration such as Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro have also gone on record criticizing the union, many in Trump\u2019s current inner circle have shared those sentiments.",

      "Underlying much of the second Trump administration\u2019s animosity toward Europe has been security funding, most prominently over the war in Ukraine.",
      "While the administration\u2019s view of the war in Ukraine has since softened, Vance has repeatedly opposed sending military aid to Kyiv, saying in February that \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d",
      "And in a Signal conversation between senior administration officials leaked in March, the vice president initially resisted U.S. strikes in Yemen, arguing he didn\u2019t want to \u201cbail Europe out,\u201d while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that Europe was treating America like a \u201csucker\u201d by relying on it for defense.",
      "While \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s call for a \u201cdeal that works for both\u201d reflects the E.U.\u2019s characteristically restrained response to the Trump administration\u2019s jabs, Europe has been bracing itself for months for the possibility of a more distant economic relationship with the U.S. too.",
      "Earlier this month, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the bloc preferred to negotiate, \u201cbut not at any cost,\u201d before announcing more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods the following day.",
      "Europe also appears to be preparing for a future without America\u2019s guarantee of European security against Russia. Germany this week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II.",
      "A brewing trade war with the bloc throws into relief the position of Britain, which voted to leave the E.U. in 2016, but recently signed a trade deal with Europe and an economic deal with the U.S.",
      "London appears to have sidestepped the steepest tariffs after Trump agreed last month to hold the levy on British goods at 10%, but the U.K. must now walk a delicate line: maintaining its \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Washington while seeking closer alignment with its largest trading partner in Brussels.",
      "But with tensions rising across the Atlantic, even allies risk being caught in the crossfire. The E.U. \u2014 a geopolitical heavyweight in its own right \u2014 is unlikely to take hefty U.S. tariffs lying down without making moves of its own."
