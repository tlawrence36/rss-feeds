      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Marvel's first family stumbled in theaters in its second weekend, but still held on to the top spot at the box office.",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d earned $40 million from 4,125 North American theaters, a 66% drop from a healthy $117.6 million debut. The film was accompanied by comedies \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d and \u201cThe Naked Gun\" in the top three box office rankings.",
      "The superhero movie dipped significantly more than Marvel's previous film, \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d which took a 55% dive in its second weekend.",
      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the last major blockbuster of the summer. It added nearly $40 million internationally in its second weekend, bringing thefilm's global total to $369 million. The movie's box office drop off was surprising given its strong reviews, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",
      "Though the movie\u2019s debut weekend may have given box office results a strong push toward the $4 billion summer benchmark, August is off to a slow start, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's a tough lift, but we might be able to get there. It really means that all the films are gonna have to stand on their own,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be about getting great reviews, having that staying power, that longevity in the marketplace.\u201d",
      "Newcomer comedy \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d earned second place at the box office this weekend, with $22 million from 3,852 North American theaters. That was on par with projections and also in line with the first movie in the series, which brought in $23 million in 2022. Paramount\u2019s slapstick comedy, \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d also in its debut weekend, snagged the third box office spot, earning $17 million from 3,344 locations.",
      "Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for \u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d coupled with strong audience reaction scores, \u201cshould point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall.\"",
      "James Gunn's \u201cSuperman,\u201d which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d followed with $8.7 million.",
      "The horror movie \u201cTogether\u201d had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what this month is about. It\u2019s not just about box office,\" Dergarabedian said. \"It\u2019s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.\u201d",
      "Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks \u2014 including \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d and Zach Cregger\u2019s horror movie \u201cWeapons\u201d \u2014 to give August a needed boost.",
      "The box office is currently up 9.5% from last year.",

Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",

      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the \u201860s and \u201970s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \u201cDon't Touch Me,\u201d 1967's \u201cI'll Love You More (Than You Need)\u201d and 1973's \u201cCan I Sleep In Your Arms?\u201d, adapted from the folk song \u201cCan I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\u201d",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform, and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones, and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \u201cSunday\u2019s with Seely\u201d on Willie Nelson's Willie\u2019s Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her latest song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \u201cSuffertime,\u201d recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A few hundred people gathered Friday to name a tiny San Francisco street after legendary Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia on what would have been his 83rd birthday and as part of a citywide celebration to mark the band's 60th anniversary.",
      "Harrington Street, which is one block long, will also be called \u201cJerry Garcia Street.\" He died in 1995, but the band's popularity has only grown as younger generations discover the Dead's improvisational music, which blended rock, blues, folk and other styles.",
      "Garcia spent part of his childhood in a modest home in the city\u2019s diverse Excelsior neighborhood. He lived with his grandparents after the death of his father, Jose Ramon \u201cJoe\u201d Garcia.",
      "\u201cI hope that you all get a chance to enjoy the music, dance, hug, smile,\u201d said daughter Trixie Garcia, growing emotional during her brief remarks. \u201cCherish what's valuable, what's significant in life.\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of fans are in San Francisco to commemorate the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary with concerts and other activities throughout the city.",
      "The latest iteration of the band, Dead & Company, with original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park\u2019s Polo Field for three days starting Friday. An estimated 60,000 attendees are expected each day.",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead played often and for free in their early years while living in a cheap Victorian home in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. The band later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love, and the Grateful Dead has become synonymous with San Francisco and its bohemian counterculture.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Herman compares the movie to another Sony animation: \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d which also attracted a broad audience with its creative animation. \u201cAnd it's a fun, animated musical, which we haven't had in a while,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s campy, it's engaging, it's universal.\u201d",
      "Santiago was initially skeptical of the title \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. They kind of like to take advantage of K-pop fans\u2019 sincerity,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cBut I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.\u201d",
      "Indeed \u2014 if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin. Instead, there are Easter eggs for the dedicated K-pop listener.",
      "Herman agrees, and says that the film has in-jokes for K-pop fans, not unlike a children's movie that features some humor meant to appeal specifically to parents.",
      "\u201cFiguring out what makes K-pop tick in a way that resonates with musical fans was really important to this movie,\u201d said Herman.",
      "For Kang, that was always at the heart of the project. \u201cFandom plays a huge part in the world being saved at the end of the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we were really confident that we were doing that justice.\u201d",

      "Blues legend Buddy Guy will release a new album on Wednesday, his 89th birthday",
      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "\"The Bad Guys 2\" hits theaters, and it's a wild ride",
      "The good news for fans of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d is the new sequel is stellar. But that's because a good portion is actually set in \u2014 are you kidding us? \u2014 outer space. \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d has clearly lost its moorings.",
      "Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days \u2014 amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. It's hard to watch a franchise drift so expensively and pointlessly in Earth's orbit.",
      "The gang is all back: Sam Rockwell as Mr. Wolf,Marc Maron as safe-cracker Mr. Snake, Craig Robinson as master-of disguise Mr. Shark, Anthony Ramos as Mr. Piranha and Awkwafina as hacker Ms. Tarantula. We left them in the last movie walking out of prison early after good behavior and trying to turn their back on bad-hood.",
      "It's not that easy since would-be employers these days want to know about gaps in their job experience \u2014 they were robbing banks, after all \u2014 workplace trust issues and salary expectations. No one wants to hire a bunch of ex-cons.",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants to change has to start somewhere,\u201d Mr. Wolf, pushing the George Clooney-like charm offensive, begs one dubious interviewer. \u201cI'm just asking for a chance.\u201d",
      "A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron \u2014 so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Now he spends his days doing Vinyasa yoga, listening to Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cEspresso,\u201d telling people \"namaste\" and sips wheatgrass kombucha with dandelion. He's even more irritating.",
      "Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew \u2014 Danielle Brooks\u2019 lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova\u2019s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne\u2019s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on \u201cPoker Face.\u201d These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever \u2014 or lazy \u2014 joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot.",
      "There's soon a trip to a Mexican wrestling festival and then a wedding needs crashing in order to gain control over a rocket owned by an Elon Musk-like billionaire \u2014 voice acted by Colin Jost \u2014 who runs the MoonX company. Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a \u201c24-carat catastrophe.\u201d",
      "The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. The franchise's love of vroooming and fishtailing Looney Tunes-like car chases stays intact, as does the wavy green air farts that emanate from Piranha.",

      "Based on Aaron Blabey\u2019s popular graphic book series, the first movie in 2022 drove hard into the nature of good and evil \u2014 like asking if DNA determines behavior \u2014 as our heroes whipsawed between heroic and villainous, to the glee of all the kiddies in the theater. \u201cWe may be bad, but we\u2019re so good at it,\u201d was the slogan. It was all nicely set against a zombie guinea pig uprising.",
      "This time the writers have just given up on what side of the ethical divide their anti-heroes are on. \u201cAre we bad again?\u201d ask the confused piranha. Replies Mr. Wolf: \u201cI get it. We're all over the place.\u201d Left unexplored is the concept of doing wrong for a greater good, and can being bad be excused if it stops a worse badness? \u201cWhat if the bad life was your best life?\u201d asks one of the newcomers. (Another thing to chew on: If \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d is a worse sequel, does that make \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d good?)",
      "When we say the gang is all here, they're all here without any editing: Zazie Beetz returns as Gov. Diane Foxington, Alex Borstein comes back as the top cop and even the kitten from the first film meows in the second. So is Richard Ayoade as Professor Marmalade, the evil guinea pig who is now surprisingly swole and tatted up in prison. He threatens again to steal the show and may if there's a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d (There's going to be a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d)",
      "The joy of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d was that it was a respectful send-up of the movies of Quentin Tarantino and caper flicks like \u201cOcean\u2019s 11.\u201d This time, the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d series gets mocked, as does \u201cSilence of the Lambs,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and maybe \u201cMoonraker,\u201d which is now 46 years old. But the subversion is painfully flat now: The first film in the franchise would have laughed at one climactic line in the second: \u201cWe've got one shot to save the world. Let's make it count!\u201d",
      "The three new villains may be a touch too much for younger viewers \u2014 the violence seems darker and more volcanic this time \u2014 but there's a very loud soundtrack that includes Busta Rhymes, Sofi Tukker and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man.",
      "So what does it all mean? It means the folks behind \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d reunited for a shot to push the franchise into exciting areas, but \u2014 c'mon, everyone \u2014 they didn't make it count.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG for \u201caction/mild violence, rude humor, and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "In June, Rapp served as a grand marshal of the World Pride parade in Washington, D.C., alongside Laverne Cox and Deacon Maccubbin. \u201cIt can be difficult to feel resilient and empowered as a queer person,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cBecause World Pride was in D.C., I was like, well, I can\u2019t not be there.\u201d She recalled a conversation with Cox, who dispelled some of Rapp's fears of coming off as self-important in the role by emphasizing the power of showing up, and showing face. \u201cRight now, when everything is so under attack, which it pretty much always is, it feels like that\u2019s the time to be really loud.\u201d",

      "Justin Timberlake has announced on Instagram Thursday that he was diagnosed with Lyme disease",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Justin Timberlake has been diagnosed with Lyme disease, the former NSYNC star said on Instagram Thursday.",
      "Timberlake shared the news in a post commemorating his Forget Tomorrow tour, which wrapped in Turkey on Wednesday, adding that the disease \u201ccan be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically.\u201d",
      "The \u201cSexyBack\u201d singer, who described himself as a private person, wrote he considered ending the tour when diagnosed, but wrote that he \u201cdecided the joy that performing brings me far out weight the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I'm so glad I kept going.\u201d",
      "Lyme disease is transmitted by Ixodes ticks, also known as deer ticks. It can cause flu-like conditions, neurological problems, joint paint and other symptoms. In the vast majority of cases, Lyme disease is successfully treated with antibiotics.",
      "\u201cI honestly don't know what my future is onstage, but I'll always cherish this run! And all of them before! It's been the stuff of legend for me,\u201d Timberlake wrote.",
      "Timberlake canceled and postponed multiple shows throughout the tour's run, citing health issues including bronchitis and laryngitis. Six of his U.S. shows were postponed from October and November to February, the singer announced on Instagram. Timberlake ultimately canceled the last show of the U.S. leg of the tour in Ohio due to the flu in February.",
      "Representatives for Timberlake did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment.",

      "For two-plus decades, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival has been a cultural reunion, a summer sanctuary and a safe haven where some of the industry's most influential voices converge in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton.",

      "Ross said traveling solo is a way of life. She said sharing her project at MVAAFF felt right, noting that the Vineyard-set episode of Akil's \u201cForever\u201d captures the spirit and beauty of the picturesque island.",
      "\u201cIt felt like the perfect location to kind of share,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timing was perfect from when the show came out.\u201d",

We have a chance to celebrate them, complete them, tell them, view them and share them with an audience. It allows for the completion of the story, so that we can move on to many, many, many more stories that need to be told.\u201d",
      "Floyd Rance described MVAAFF as a vital part of the entertainment ecosystem, offering a platform where Black voices and stories are given the spotlight they deserve.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have somewhat of a convergence for folks of like mind in the arts and entertainment to gather, coalesce, share ideas, rekindle friendships and fellowship,\u201d said Floyd, who along with Stephanie said they did not expect their festival to become such a main attraction.",

She\u2019s especially excited for attendees to experience a range of conversations, from little-known moments in Black history to a panel on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Oak Bluffs collection with Morehouse and Spelman.",

      "U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",
      "In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d",

      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",
      "Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.",
      "Shalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle's \u201cgenes\u201d versus \u201cjeans\u201d because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty.",
      "\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d",
      "Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.",
      "Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.",
      "The demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races.",
      "Some marketers say they've observed another shift since President Donald Trump returned to office and moved to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies.",
      "Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.",
      "\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.",
      "American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.",
      "The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.",
      "Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.",

      "Tens of thousands of Deadheads are pouring into San Francisco for three days of Dead & Company concerts in honor of the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Fans of the Grateful Dead are pouring into San Francisco for three days of concerts and festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the scruffy jam band that came to embody a city where people wore flowers in their hair and made love, not war.",
      "Dead & Company, featuring original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field starting Friday with an estimated 60,000 attendees each day. The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",
      "Certainly, times have changed.",
      "A general admissions ticket for all three days is $635 \u2014 a shock for many longtime fans who remember when a joint cost more than a Dead concert ticket.",
      "But Deadhead David Aberdeen is thrilled anyway.",
      "\u201cThis is the spiritual home of the Grateful Dead,\u201d said Aberdeen, who works at Amoeba Music in the bohemian, flower-powered Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. \u201cIt seems very right to me that they celebrate it in this way.\u201d",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead is synonymous with San Francisco and its counterculture. Members lived in a dirt-cheap Victorian in the Haight and later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love.",
      "That summer eventually soured into bad acid trips and police raids, and prompted the band's move to Marin County on the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge. But new Deadheads kept cropping up \u2014 even after iconic guitarist and singer Jerry Garcia \u2019s 1995 death \u2014 aided by cover bands and offshoots like Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cThere are 18-year-olds who were obviously not even a twinkle in somebody\u2019s eyes when Jerry died, and these 18-year-olds get the values of Deadheads,\u201d said former Grateful Dead publicist and author Dennis McNally.",
      "Deadheads can reel off why and how, and the moment they fell in love with the music. Fans love that no two shows are the same; the band plays different songs each time. They also embrace the community that comes with a Dead show.",
      "Sunshine Powers didn\u2019t have friends until age 13, when she stepped off a city bus and into the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.",
      "\u201cI, all of a sudden, felt like I fit in. Or like I didn\u2019t have to fit in,\u201d says Powers, now 45 and the owner of tie-dye emporium Love on Haight. \u201cI don\u2019t know which one it was, but I know it was like, OK.\"",
      "Similarly, her friend Taylor Swope, 47, survived a tough freshman year at a new school with the help of a Grateful Dead mixtape. The owner of the Little Hippie gift shop is driving from Brooklyn, New York, to sell merchandise, reconnect with friends and see the shows.",
      "\u201cThe sense of, \u2018I found my people, I didn\u2019t fit in anywhere else and then I found this, and I felt at home.\u2019 So that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d she said of the allure.",
      "Sometimes, becoming a Deadhead is a process.",
      "Thor Cromer, 60, had attended several Dead shows, but was ambivalent about the hippies. That changed on March 15, 1990, in Landover, Maryland.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More than 20 mostly Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood.",
      "The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed earlier this month. A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.",
      "The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. The goal was to target Planned Parenthood, but the legislation also affected a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "California, New York, Connecticut, other states and Washington, D.C. argue in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to. They also say it retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access, violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment.",
      "The states are asking that the portion of the law be blocked and deemed unconstitutional.",
      "The cuts threaten health care access for many low-income Americans, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis attack isn't just about abortion,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cIt's about denying vulnerable communities access to care they rely on every day.\u201d",

      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts. Planned Parenthood said although it is not specifically named in the law, the provision was meant to affect its nearly 600 centers in 48 states. About a third of those clinics risk closure because of the legislation, which would strip care from more than 1 million patients, the group argues.",

      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the share of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to federal data posted Thursday.",
      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",

      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",

      "FLINT, Mich. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",

      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",

      "South Korea\u2019s military says it has begun removing loudspeakers along its border with rival North Korea in a move aimed at reducing tensions",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military said Monday it had begun removing loudspeakers along its border with rival North Korea in a move aimed at reducing tensions.",
      "The speakers had previously been used to blast anti-North Korean propaganda across the border, but the South\u2019s new liberal government halted the broadcasts in June in a conciliatory gesture as it looks to rebuild trust and revive dialogue with Pyongyang, which has largely cut off cooperation with the South in recent years.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said the physical removal of the loudspeakers from the border was another \u201cpractical measure\u201d aimed at easing tensions between the war-divided Koreas and that it does not affect the South\u2019s military readiness.",
      "Lee Kyung-ho, a spokesperson for the ministry, didn\u2019t share specific details on how the removed loudspeakers will be stored or whether they could be quickly redeployed to the border if tensions flare again between the Koreas. There were no discussions between the two militaries ahead of the South\u2019s decision to remove the speakers, Lee said during a briefing.",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn\u2019t immediately comment on the South Korean step.",
      "The South\u2019s previous conservative government resumed the daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",

      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns further heightened tensions already inflamed by North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and their trilateral security cooperation with Japan.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, a liberal who took office in June after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "But Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, rebuffed overtures by Lee\u2019s government last week, saying that Seoul\u2019s \u201cblind trust\u201d in the country\u2019s alliance with the U.S. and hostility toward North Korea make it no different from its conservative predecessor. Her comments implied that North Korea \u2014 now preoccupied with its expanding cooperation with Russia over the war in Ukraine \u2013 feels no urgency to resume diplomacy with Seoul and Washington anytime soon.",

      "Kayo so far has found about 100 bone fragments, including skull pieces and an infant\u2019s jaw bone with little teeth attached. He found the bones in an area suggested by a Ninoshima resident, whose father had witnessed soldiers burying bodies that were brought to the island on boats from Hiroshima 80 years ago.",

      "As a 3-year-old child, Tamiko Sora was with her parents and two sisters at their home just 1.4 kilometers (0.9 mile) from the hypocenter. The blast destroyed their house and Sora's face was burned, but most of her family survived.",

Sora still thinks of them often and regrets her family could not help. Her family visited orphanages but could not find the girl.",
      "Sora now thinks the people she met that day, as well as her missing aunt and uncle, might have ended up on Ninoshima.",

      "Vietnam's Vinfast is to set break ground on a $500 million electric vehicle plant in India\u2019s Tamil Nadu, part of a larger $2 billion investment to expand into Asian markets",
      "THOOTHUKUDI, India -- Vietnam\u2019s Vinfast is due to break ground Monday on a $500 million electric vehicle plant in southern India\u2019s Tamil Nadu state, part of a planned $2 billion investment in India and a broader expansion across Asia.",
      "The factory in Thoothukudi will initially make 50,000 electric vehicles annually, with room to triple output to 150,000 cars. Given its proximity to a major port in one of India's most industrialized states, Vinfast hopes it will be a hub for future exports to the region. It says the factory will create more than 3,000 local jobs.",
      "The Vietnamese company says it scouted 15 locations across six Indian states before choosing Tamil Nadu. It's the center of India\u2019s auto industry, with strong manufacturing, skilled workers, good infrastructure, and a reliable supply chain, according to Tamil Nadu\u2019s Industries Minister T.R.B. Raaja.",
      "\u201cThis investment will lead to an entirely new industrial cluster in south Tamil Nadu, and more clusters is what India needs to emerge as a global manufacturing hub,\u201d he said.",
      "Vinfast's foray into India reflects a broader shift in strategy.",
      "The company increasingly is focusing on Asian markets after struggling to gain traction in the U.S. and Europe. It broke ground last year on a $200 million EV assembly plant in Indonesia, where it plans to make 50,000 cars annually. It's also expanding in Thailand and the Philippines.",
      "Vinfast sold nearly 97,000 vehicles in 2024. That's triple what it sold the year before, but only about 10% of those sales were outside Vietnam. As it eyes markets in Asia, it hopes the factory in India will be a base for exports to South Asian countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka and also to countries in the Middle East and Africa.",
      "India is the world\u2019s third-largest car market by number of vehicles sold. It presents an enticing mix: A fast growing economy, rising adoption of EVs, supportive government policies and a rare market where players have yet to completely dominate EV sales.",
      "\u201cIt is a market that no automaker in the world can ignore,\u201d said Ishan Raghav, managing editor of the Indian car magazine autoX. .",
      "EV growth in India has been led by two and three-wheelers that accounted for 86% of the over six million EVs sold last year.",
      "Sales of four wheel passenger EVs made up only 2.5% of all car sales in India last year, but they have been surging, jumping to more than 110,000 in 2024 from just 1,841 in 2019. The government aims to have EVs account for a third of all passenger vehicle sales by 2030.",
      "\u201cThe electric car story has started (in India) only three or four years ago,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy specialist who looks at India\u2019s transport and clean energy sectors for the think-tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. New cars that \u201clook great on the road,\u201d with better batteries, quick charging and longer driving ranges are driving the sector's rapid growth, he said.",
      "The shift to EVs is mostly powered by Indian automakers, but Vinfast plans to break into the market later this year with its VF6 and VF7 SUV models, which are designed for India..",
      "Chinese EV brands that dominate in countries like Thailand and Brazil have found India more challenging.",
      "After border clashes with China in 2020, India blocked companies like BYD from building their own factories. Some then turned to partnerships. China's SAIC, owner of MG Motor, has joined with India\u2019s JSW Group. Their MG Windsor, a five-seater, sold 30,000 units in just nine months, nibbling Tata Motors\u2019 70% EV market share down to about 50%.",

      "Experts and community groups warn that the mix of anger, fear, misinformation and political agitating that fueled that violence could erupt again, though protests this summer have been small and largely peaceful.",

      "Patel was in Wellington on Thursday to open the FBI\u2019s first standalone office in New Zealand and to meet senior officials. The arrangement aligns New Zealand with FBI missions in other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations, which also include the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.",

      "New Zealand ministers who met Patel, the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit New Zealand, quietly dismissed his claims. A government statement Thursday emphasized joint efforts against crimes such as online child exploitation and drug smuggling, with no mention of China.",

      "The Pride march in Budapest on June 28 was the largest event of its kind in the country's history, according to organizers, despite Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's government earlier passing an anti-LGBTQ+ law that banned such events.",
      "Budapest Mayor Gergely Kar\u00e1csony arrived at Hungary's National Bureau of Investigation Friday morning where a crowd of around 200 of his supporters had gathered. Before entering the investigators' headquarters under police escort, he told supporters that freedom for Hungarian society was at stake.",

      "Leo encountered a sea of people as he arrived by helicopter at the Tor Vergata field on Rome\u2019s outskirts for a vigil service of the Jubilee of Youth. Hailing from early 150 countries, the pilgrims had set up campsites on the field for the night, as misting trucks and water cannons spritzed them to cool them down from the 30C (85F) temperatures.",
      "Leo displayed his fluency in speaking to the kids in Spanish, Italian and English about the dangers of social media, the value of true friendship and the need to have courage to make radical choices like marriage or religious vows.",
      "\u201cFriendship can really change the world. Friendship is a path to peace,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much the world needs missionaries of the Gospel who are witnesses of justice and peace!\u201d",
      "But history's first American pope also alerted them to some tragic news: Two young people who had made the pilgrimage to Rome had died, one reportedly of cardiac arrest, while a third was hospitalized, Leo told the crowd during the vigil service.",
      "Leo was to return to the field for an early morning Mass on Sunday morning to close out the celebration.",
      "For the past week, these bands of young Catholics from around the world have poured into Rome for their special Jubilee celebration, in a Holy Year in which 32 million people are expected to descend on the Vatican to participate in a centuries-old pilgrimage to the seat of Catholicism.",
      "The young people have been traipsing down cobblestoned streets in color-coordinated T-shirts, praying the Rosary and singing hymns with guitars, bongo drums and tambourines shimmying alongside. Using their flags as tarps to shield them from the sun, they have taken over entire piazzas for Christian rock concerts and inspirational talks, and stood for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to 1,000 priests offering the sacrament in a dozen different languages.",
      "\u201cIt is something spiritual, that you can experience only every 25 years,\u201d said Francisco Michel, a pilgrim from Mexico. \u201cAs a young person, having the chance to live this meting with the pope I feel it is a spiritual growth.\u201d",
      "It all has the vibe of a World Youth Day, the Catholic Woodstock festival that St. John Paul II inaugurated and made famous in Rome in 2000 at the very same Tor Vergata field. Then, before an estimated 2 million people, John Paul told the young pilgrims they were the \u201csentinels of the morning\u201d at the dawn of the third millennium.",

Atkinson discovered a penchant for chianti, while Fortino fell for Italy\u2019s hugo spritz \u2014 a cocktail that posed no risk of staining her wedding dress on July 24.",
      "Italy has hosted a number of star-studded weddings in the past decade, most recently Jeff Bezos and Lauren S\u00e1nchez \u2019s extravaganza in Venice. Away from the spotlight, tens of thousands of ordinary Americans have set their sights on the country for their special day in recent years.",
      "\u201cWeddings in America can be a little too grand and a little bit too big and it ends up not really being about the couple,\u201d said Fortino, 28, a neonatal nurse from Skaneateles, New York. \u201cWe both just really wanted something intimate and meaningful.\u201d",
      "Over 15,000 foreign couples wed in Italy last year, up 64% from 2019, the year before the pandemic, according to market research from the Center of Tourist Studies of Florence. Growth was led by U.S couples, who account for almost one-third of that total.",
      "Italy was the top international destination for American couples after Mexico, according to Maryland-based wedding planning website The Knot.",
      "For many Americans, Italy embodies the simple, beautiful romance of a bygone era. Weather is balmy and its varied landscapes, from the sea to the mountains, stunning. The food is familiar and crowd-pleasing. But perhaps the biggest driver of the recent uptick is ample opportunity for a range of outings, which together with the wedding event are alluring for those on a quest for unique, memorable moments \u2014 part of a consumer trend termed \u201cthe experience economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the United States, everything is just more expensive for one night and we wanted to make an experience, so we did two nights here,\" said Atkinson, 31, who owns a concrete company. \u201cIt just seemed like way more worth it to us to do that and make a trip out of it with our family, our loved ones.\u201d",
      "One guest who had never visited Italy was ecstatic about the invite, and took advantage to tack on side trips, first to Venice and then with the wedding crew to Cinque Terre. Another, Gary Prochna, nearly didn\u2019t attend because of work piling up at his paving company. He eventually came around and was floored by the venue \u2014 a 15th-century villa with a sweeping view over Florence and its famous Duomo.",
      "\u201cI got married in the United States and our venue was very nice. I thought \u2014 until this moment \u2014 we had the best wedding,\u201d said Prochna, 68, adding that he now hopes his daughters will get hitched abroad.",
      "Marcy Blum, a prominent luxury event planner based in Manhattan, said almost 90% of the weddings she plans are in Italy.",
      "\u201cThe reason Italy is so popular is because that\u2019s where your guests want to go,\u201d she said. \"You send an invitation that you\u2019re getting married in Capri or Positano and everybody comes. Everybody. They want to come. Nobody cancels.\u201d",

      "The threat of tariffs under President Donald Trump has given destination weddings a boost. Ezon has moved six events from the U.S. to Europe this year, because people were afraid tariffs on alcohol would cause their bar bill to explode.",
      "The shift to destinations has benefited planners with networks across Italy and local vendors. According to Wedding Italy, the husband-and-wife team who put on the Atkinson wedding, American clients spend three times as much as Italians, due to more elaborate wedding decor and other events in their multi-day lineup.",

      "The Swiss government spent Friday \u2014 the country\u2019s National Day \u2014 reeling from the news.

Once the manufacturers factor in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Swiss francs ($1 to 1.23 francs on Friday), Wehrli said, it's close to a 50% increase in costs for the Swiss companies.

      "MIAMI -- A Miami jury decided that Elon Musk\u2019s car company Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology and must pay the victims more than $200 million in punitive damages.",
      "The federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility because its technology failed and that not all the blame can be put on a reckless driver, even one who admitted he was distracted by his cell phone before hitting a young couple out gazing at the stars. The decision comes as Musk seeks to convince Americans his cars are safe enough to drive on their own as he plans to roll out a driverless taxi service in several cities in the coming months.",
      "The decision ends a four-year long case remarkable not just in its outcome but that it even made it to trial. Many similar cases against Tesla have been dismissed and, when that didn't happen, settled by the company to avoid the spotlight of a trial.",
      "\u201cThis will open the floodgates,\u201d said Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case. \u201cIt will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\u201d",
      "The case also included startling charges by lawyers for the family of the deceased, 22-year-old, Naibel Benavides Leon, and for her injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. They claimed Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident.",
      "Tesla has previously faced criticism that it is slow to cough up crucial data by relatives of other victims in Tesla crashes, accusations that the car company has denied. In this case, the plaintiffs showed Tesla had the evidence all along, despite its repeated denials, by hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up. Tesla said it made a mistake after being shown the evidence and honestly hadn\u2019t thought it was there.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is wrong,\" Tesla said in a statement, \u201cand only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\u201d They said the plaintiffs concocted a story \u201dblaming the car when the driver \u2013 from day one \u2013 admitted and accepted responsibility.\u201d",
      "In addition to the punitive award, the jury said Tesla must also pay $49 million in compensatory damages, bringing the total borne by the company to $249 million.",
      "\u201cIt's a big number that will send shockwaves to others in the industry,\u201d said financial analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt's not a good day for Tesla.\u201d",
      "Tesla said it will appeal.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of a hit to Tesla\u2019s reputation for safety the verdict in the Miami case will make. Tesla has vastly improved its technology since the crash on a dark, rural road in Key Largo, Florida, in 2019.",
      "But the issue of trust generally in the company came up several times in the case, including in closing arguments Thursday. The plaintiffs\u2019 lead lawyer, Brett Schreiber, said Tesla\u2019s decision to even use the term Autopilot showed it was willing to mislead people and take big risks with their lives because the system only helps drivers with lane changes, slowing a car and other tasks, falling far short of driving the car itself.",
      "Schreiber said other automakers use terms like \u201cdriver assist\u201d and \u201ccopilot\u201d to make sure drivers don\u2019t rely too much on the technology.",

      "Schreiber acknowledged that the driver, George McGee, was negligent when he blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles an hour before slamming into a Chevrolet Tahoe that the couple had parked to get a look at the stars.",
      "The Tahoe spun around so hard it was able to launch Benavides 75 feet through the air into nearby woods where her body was later found. It also left Angulo, who walked into the courtroom Friday with a limp and cushion to sit on, with broken bones and a traumatic brain injury.",
      "But Schreiber said Tesla was at fault nonetheless. He said Tesla allowed drivers to act recklessly by not disengaging the Autopilot as soon as they begin to show signs of distraction and by allowing them to use the system on smaller roads that it was not designed for, like the one McGee was driving on.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said McGee at one point in his testimony. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "The lead defense lawyer in the Miami case, Joel Smith, countered that Tesla warns drivers that they must keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel yet McGee chose not to do that while he looked for a dropped cell phone, adding to the danger by speeding. Noting that McGee had gone through the same intersection 30 or 40 times previously and hadn\u2019t crashed during any of those trips, Smith said that this isolates the cause to one thing alone: \u201cThe cause is that he dropped his cell phone.\u201d",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft\u2019s core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",

Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI think one of the reasons why that cash hasn\u2019t been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there\u2019s a logical case to be made they\u2019ll accept it.\u201d",

      "Two pubs in London's East End are vying for the title of the city's oldest riverside pub",
      "LONDON -- On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London\u2019s East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads \u201cOldest riverside pub in London.\u201d Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim.",
      "The unofficial title of the oldest riverside pub in the city has long been disputed, with both the Mayflower and the Prospect of Whitby laying claim to the title.",
      "The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city\u2019s crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes \u2014 from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding \u2014 with a side of history.",
      "The Mayflower is named after the Pilgrim Mayflower ship, which set sail from the site in 1620 to begin its journey to America. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship\u2019s original timbers incorporated into its structure.",
      "Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its \u201cDescendants Book.\u201d",
      "Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital\u2019s modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London\u2019s East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses.",
      "In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind.",
      "\u201cThere really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,\" said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening.",
      "The Prospect boasts a pewter bar \u2013 the longest of its kind in Britain \u2014 where the infamous \u201cHanging Judge Jeffreys\u201d is said to have watched the many hangings that took place at the nearby \u201cExecution Dock.\u201d Early on, the pub was known as the Devil\u2019s Tavern due to its association with thieves and smugglers. A hanging noose outside serves as a reminder of the pub\u2019s grisly history.",
      "It \u201cfeels like such a pocket of history in London,\u201d Godwin said. \u201cSo much of London\u2019s East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it\u2019s barely changed.\u201d",
      "British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. But the last five years have been challenging for the industry as pubs contended with the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs.",
      "This year an estimated 378 venues are set to shutter across England, Wales, and Scotland, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.",
      "\u201cWhen a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul and hurts the local economy,\u201d said Emma McClarkin, head of the BBPA.",
      "Pubs across the country have been forced to find new ways to attract customers.",

      "History is a big draw for pubgoers, with a trip to a traditional British pub coming in high on tourists\u2019 London bucket lists, raising the stakes of the Prospect and the Mayflower\u2019s competition.",
      "The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 \u2014 the same year as the Great Fire of London. The pub was outside of the city limits at that time and was not affected by the conflagration that gutted the medieval city.",
      "Justin Billington, assistant manager at the Prospect, said some people date the pub to its full reconstruction in 1774 after the 1666 fire. But he doesn't see it that way, noting that it operated continuously. The day after the fire, the workers rolled out a barrel of beer that had survived the flames and locals showed up with their tankards, drinking vessels, and enjoyed a drink on the spot.",
      "There were several reconstructions in the pub's subsequent history, but none withstood the salt water and shifting foundations of the Thames, Billington explained. Not, that is, until 1774 when the retired captain of a merchant ship called \u201cThe Prospect\u201d rebuilt it using the ship.",
      "\u201cThis rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,\" he said.",
      "If the pub was actually established in 1774, that would make the Mayflower \u2014 established in the 16th century \u2014 older.",
      "But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a \u201cloving rivalry.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,\u201d he said.",
      "But the question remains: How can either pub definitively claim the title?",
      "Unlike the title of the \u201cOldest pub in England,\u201d held by the Porch House in southern England, which is said to date to the 10th century, there is no official certification for the oldest pub in London.",
      "Guinness World Records said it has not formally awarded the title because of the complexities created by numerous name changes, relocations and reconstructions.",
      "\u201cThere are lots of very old pubs that might make a claim to being oldest, but it could be contested because it could be argued they weren\u2019t always in \u2018London,\u2019\u201d English historian and author Jacob Field said. \u201cMany pubs have changed name over time, making it hard to claim they are the oldest.\"",

      "Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion.",
      "The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start.",
      "After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September.",
      "A Biden-administration grace period, during which late or missed payments were not counted against credit scores, ended in the fall.",
      "Since then, millions of borrowers have seen hits to their credit ratings.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "\u201cThe most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,\u201d said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.",
      "Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers.",
      "If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan.",
      "\u201cBecause this hasn\u2019t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they\u2019re at risk,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Ba\u00f1ez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request.",
      "\u201cThese offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you can request assistance from your member of congress \u2014 your representative or senator.\u201d",
      "Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks.",

      "Richelle Brooks, 37, an education administrator based in Los Angeles, said she's received warnings and notices about the resumption of collection of her loans. For several degrees, she still has $239,000 in outstanding debt, and she was informed her monthly payments on those loans will be roughly $3,000.",
      "\u201cI can't afford it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just came out of the moratorium \u2014 not paying for five years. People getting these notices \u2014 they're terrified. I'm uneasy, too.\"",
      "Brooks said she's an informed borrower who stays up to date on each development and who knows her options. She plans to enroll in coding classes, at least half-time, which could place her loans in deferment, so she wouldn't be required to make monthly payments, while she makes a financial plan.",
      "There's still time to take action.",
      "According to Taylor, the Department of Education must provide 30 days notice before it sends a garnishment order to your employer. During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses.",
      "To do this, you must make your hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days after the garnishment order. Your loan holder will then arrange the hearing. If you're unsure who your loan holder is, you can contact the Education Department's Default Resolution Group.",
      "If you were laid off from your last job, you can also object to garnishment if you have not been in your current job for 12 consecutive months. You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy.",
      "\u201cIf the borrower requests a hearing within 30 days after receiving the garnishment notice, the department cannot start garnishment until it issues a decision on the borrower\u2019s objections and financial hardship request,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "You can request a hearing after the 30 day period is up, but in those cases the department will generally not stop garnishing your wages while the hearing request is pending.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have drawn expressions of relief from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April",
      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries drew expressions of relief Friday from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others expressed disappointment or frustration over running out of time after hitting Trump's Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America\u2019s trading partners.",
      "The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7, but uncertainty over what Trump might do next remains. The way ahead for China, which runs the largest trade surplus with the U.S., is unclear after talks earlier this week in Stockholm produced no deal. Trump has yet to say if he'll extend an Aug. 12 pause on painfully high import duties on Chinese products.",
      "The reaction from financial markets was muted. Benchmarks fell in Asia, with South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping nearly 4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at more than 150 yen per dollar.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government was disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.",
      "Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.",
      "\u201cCanada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\u201d Carney said in a statement.",

      "Switzerland was reeling after Trump ordered a 39% tariff rate for the land of luxury watches, pharmaceuticals and financial services. That was up from his original proposal of a 31% duty.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Council notes with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland\u2019s very constructive stance from the outset, the U.S. intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland,\u201d the government said in a post on X. It said it would continue to seek a negotiated solution.",
      "New Zealand officials said Friday they would keep lobbying Trump to cut the 15% tariff he announced for their country\u2019s exports to the U.S., up from the original 10% baseline set in April.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a good thing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Trade Minister Todd McClay told Radio New Zealand. The exporter of meat, dairy, wine and farm machinery ran a $1.1 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, according to U.S. Trade Representative data.",
      "McClay said New Zealand exporters had reported they could absorb a 10% tariff or pass it on to U.S. consumers through increased costs. A further increase would \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said.",
      "Neither New Zealand nor its neighbor Australia have struck tariff deals with the Trump administration. Australian steel and aluminum exports have faced a steep 50% tariff since June.",
      "Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the 10% overall tariff on Australia\u2019s exports to the United States was a vindication of his government\u2019s \u201ccool and calm negotiations.\u201d But he said even that level was not justified. The U.S. exports twice as much to Australia as it imports from its bilateral free trade partner, and Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. exports.",

The annual event aims to promote the traditional liquor, which is far less known internationally than whiskey or vodka.",
      "Moutai, a kind of baijiu made in mountainous Guizhou province in southwestern China, is known as the country\u2019s \u201cnational liquor.\u201d",

      "The report forecast China\u2019s baijiu production will likely fall for the eighth straight year in 2025. Baijiu consumption has dropped as people spend more cautiously, cutting back on banquets and drinking due to a weaker economy.",

      "HONG KONG -- A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions appealed on Friday for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company's contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits in the Central American country.",
      "Respect for the rule of law is essential to assure businesses that Panama is a safe place to invest in, Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, said in a statement.",
      "Panama\u2019s Comptroller General filed two lawsuits on Wednesday, seeking to declare unconstitutional a contract that granted the operation of ports at both ends of the canal to the Hong Kong subsidiary, and to nullify its renewal four years ago, saying it was \u201cabusive\u201d of Panama's interests.",
      "In turn, Panama Ports Company said its operations have had a positive impact, from building world-class ports to creating more than 25,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing billions of balboas \u2014 Panama's currency \u2014 to the country's economy.",
      "It said it wants to work with the government in Panama for a better future.",
      "\u201cRegarding the ongoing legal actions, we firmly believe that respect for legal protection and the rule of law are essential in order to provide businesses and investors with the certainty that Panama is a safe country to invest in,\u201d it said.",
      "The company operates the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, under a concession contract approved in 1997 and renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city\u2019s richest man.",
      "Panama\u2019s comptroller authority in April said that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of the concession. But the company denied allegations that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said during his weekly news conference on Thursday that he fully supported the comptroller\u2019s case and would await the court\u2019s verdict.",
      "\u201cWe have all seen what that contract has costed the Panamanian nation over time,\u201d Mulino said without elaborating.

      "The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the U.S. uninsured population will grow by 10 million in 2034, due to the tax and spending bill signed into law by President Donald Trump.",
      "And, thanks to a natural experiment nearly two decades ago, researchers can forecast what that will mean for patient care. Among the problems they predict will develop as a direct result of these people losing coverage:",

      "Here\u2019s a deeper look at the research and challenges that could develop.",
      "It will become harder for many people to enroll in Medicaid or individual insurance plans and then stay covered. Medicaid is a state and federally funded program that covers care for people with low incomes.",
      "States will have to verify every six months whether someone remains eligible for Medicaid. That could cause coverage lapses for people with incomes that fluctuate or for those who move and miss renewal paperwork.",
      "Many also are expected to lose coverage as states require Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or go to school unless exempted.",
      "Enrollment in Medicaid has swelled in recent years. Republicans are cutting back in part to help fund tax breaks and pay for other priorities like border security. They also say they are trying to root out waste and fraud by rightsizing Medicaid for the population it was initially designed to serve \u2014 mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children.",
      "People covered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual insurance marketplaces also will see shorter enrollment windows and no more automatic renewals.",
      "Gaffney, of Harvard Medical School, and other researchers looked to past studies to measure how many people would experience detrimental effects, like going without prescriptions, from the upcoming changes. Gaffney updated the published analysis, which was originally based on the House version of the bill, at the AP\u2019s request.",
      "One study in particular was critical for their work: In 2008, Oregon offered a rare opportunity to compare groups of people enrolled in Medicaid with those who were not.",
      "After a four-year period of frozen enrollment due to budget limitations, the state determined it could enroll 10,000 more people in Medicaid. It used a lottery system to make the selection amid high demand.",
      "That gave researchers a chance to follow people who got coverage and those who did not, similar to how scientists testing a new drug might compare patients taking it to those given a placebo.",
      "\u201cThis is a gold standard research design because it replicates a randomized-controlled trial,\u201d said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at RAND Corp. who was not involved in the study.",
      "Applying results from that study and other research to the recent CBO estimate allowed Gaffney and other researchers to estimate specific effects of losing coverage.",

      "American businesses and consumers are finding the contours of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign trade agenda taking shape",
      "It\u2019s been almost 100 years since the U.S. had tariffs at the level they could reach next Friday.",
      "Once President Donald Trump's planned tariffs take effect, Americans will see an average tax of 18.3% for imported products, the highest rate since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center.",
      "Late Thursday, Trump ordered new tariff rates for 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. Among them: a 40% tariff on imports from Laos, a 39% tariff on goods from Switzerland and a 30% tariff on South African products.",
      "Other trade partners, such as Cambodia and Bangladesh, had the tax rates on their exports to the U.S. reduced from levels the president had threatened to impose. Trump postponed the start date for all of the changes from Friday until Aug. 7.",
      "Tariffs are a tax, and U.S. consumers are likely to foot at least part of the bill. The Budget Lab estimated that prices will increase 1.8% in the short term as a result of the trade war the U.S. waged this year. That\u2019s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, the group said.",
      "Companies are dealing with tariffs in various ways. Many automakers appear to be swallowing tariff costs for now. But the world\u2019s largest eyewear maker, EssilorLuxottica, said it raised U.S. prices due to tariffs. The maker of Ray-Bans grinds lenses and sunglasses in Mexico, Thailand and China and exports premium frames from Italy.",
      "\u201cRetailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new tariffs will impact merchandise in the coming weeks,\u201d David French, chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, the nation\u2019s largest retail trade group, said Friday. \u201cWe have heard directly from small retailers who are concerned about their ability to stay in business in the face of these unsustainable tariff rates.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the tariffs and what their impact will be on U.S. consumers:",
      "Trump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from nearly every country in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.",
      "The president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that the higher tariffs would go into effect Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals.",
      "In announcing the new rates for dozens of countries on Thursday, Trump delayed their implementation until Aug. 7.",
      "In the meantime, he announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada would take effect Friday. But Trump delayed action on Mexico and China while negotiations continue.",
      "Other duties not specific to countries also remained in place Friday, like a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June.",
      "The Trump administration reached deals with the European Union, Japan and South Korea that put 15% tariffs in place. A deal with the Philippines puts 19% tariffs in place while a deal with Vietnam imposes a 20% levy. This week, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods from India and ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal court that specializes in trade disputes, ruled in May that Trump exceeded his authority when he invoked an emergency powers law to implement tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, an 11-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals considered the case, and judges expressed skepticism that Trump could impose tariffs without congressional approval. The case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May and higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%. Furniture, computers and other items that often come from abroad were among the categories with higher average prices.",

      "Wendong Zhang, an associate professor in the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University, said U.S. consumers could see prices increases in the coming months for appliances and other products that contain a large amount of steel and aluminum.",
      "But Zhang said a 15% tariff doesn't mean prices will immediately rise by 15%. Companies were aware of the tariff deadlines, and tried to stockpile goods and take other measures to mitigate the impacts, he said.",
      "Zhang noted that Trump's trade deals often contain specific provisions designed to boost U.S. exports. The agreement with the European Union, for example, calls for European companies to purchase $750 billion worth of natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel from the U.S. over three years.",
      "Some U.S. farmers could also see a potential upside, Zhang said. As part of its trade deal, Vietnam agreed to purchase $2 billion in U.S. agricultural products over three years, including corn, wheat and soybeans, according to the International Trade Council.",
      "But Zhang cautioned that agricultural agreements tend to be short-lived. Over the longer term, the uncertainty over tariffs could cause countries like China to back away from U.S. agricultural markets, he said.",
      "The tariffs will almost certainly result in higher food prices, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. The U.S. simply doesn't make enough of some products, like bananas or coffee, to satisfy demand. Fish, beer and liquor are also likely to get more expensive, the foundation said.",
      "Ben Aneff, managing partner at Tribeca Wine Merchants and president of the U.S. Wine Trade Alliance, said shoppers would see prices rise 20% to 25% at his store and others starting Friday because of tariffs and the declining value of the dollar.",
      "\u201cNobody can afford to eat the tariff. It gets passed on,\" Aneff said.",
      "Aneff said shoppers haven\u2019t felt the impact from higher duties until now because distributors and retailers accelerated shipments from France and other European Union countries earlier in the year. But with the EU's tariff rate set to go up to 15% in a week, Aneff expects European wine prices to jump 30% in September.",
      "Ninety-seven percent of clothing and shoes sold in the U.S. are imported, primarily from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association said. China leads the pack, but companies have been shifting more of their sourcing to Vietnam, Indonesia and India.",
      "Steve Lamar, the trade group's president and CEO, declined to estimate how much apparel and footwear prices may increase due to tariffs. But companies may offer fewer discounts or drop products starting this fall because they're too expensive to produce, he said.",
      "Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, estimates prices for shoes are starting to go up for the back-to-school shopping season. He estimates price increases in the 5% to 10% range.",
      "Some automakers have already raised prices to counteract tariffs. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said Thursday it was waiting for more details of Trump's trade deal with the European Union before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put in place in April on most vehicles in the U.S.",
      "But for the most part, automakers haven't raised prices as they waited for details. Kelley Blue Book, which monitors car pricing, said the average U.S. new car cost $48,907 in June, which was up just $108 from May.",
      "But that could change. General Motors said last week that the impact of the tariffs could get more pronounced in the third quarter of the year. GM has estimated that the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year.",

      "The tariffs were paused across the board but the anticipated increase wreaked havoc across the country's textile industry, which is its biggest private sector employer with over 30,000 workers.",
      "About 12,000 of these workers work for garment factories exporting to the U.S. market, supplying American retailers like Levi's and Wrangler.",
      "The Associated Press reported this week that clothing manufacturer Tzicc has seen business dry up ahead of the expected tariff increase, sending home most of its 1,300 workers who have made and exported sportswear to American stores, including JCPenney, Walmart and Costco.",
      "David Chen, chairperson of the Lesotho Textile Exporters, has warned that the U.S. government\u2019s move to reduce the tariffs offer little relief for the struggling industry as their competitors have lesser tariffs.",
      "\u201cOther countries which we are competing against are already being charged 10 percent, which makes it difficult for us to compete on an equal footing,\" said Chen, singling out the east African country of Kenya as its strongest competitor with a more favorable 10% tariff.",
      "\u201cAs a result, many factories will have to shut down,\u201d said Chen. \u201cThey had already been forced to lay off workers when the tariffs were first announced in April.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the agency that compiles the closely watched monthly jobs report usually toils in obscurity, but on Friday, the current holder of that job was loudly fired by the president of the United States.",
      "Erika McEntarfer, a longtime government employee, bore the brunt of President Donald Trump\u2019s unhappiness with Friday\u2019s jobs report, which showed that hiring had slowed in July and was much less in May and June that previously estimated. He accused her without evidence of manipulating the job numbers and noted she was an appointee of President Joe Biden.",
      "McEntarfer, a longtime government worker who had served as BLS head for a year and a half, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press. But her predecessor overseeing the jobs agency, former co-workers and associates have denounced the firing, warning about its repercussions and saying McEntarfer was nonpolitical in her role.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Erika McEntarfer:",
      "McEntarfer, whose research focuses on job loss, retirement, worker mobility, and wage rigidity, had previously worked at the Census Bureau\u2019s Center for Economic Studies, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Tax Policy and the White House Council of Economic Advisers in a nonpolitical role.",
      "She has a bachelor's degree in Social Science from Bard College and a doctoral degree in economics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.",
      "McEntarfer was nominated in 2023 to serve as BLS head, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions recommended that her nomination go to the full Senate for a vote.",

      "The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, a move that will likely underscore the deep divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and President Donald Trump see the economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, a move that will likely underscore the deep divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and his chief critic, President Donald Trump, see the economy.",
      "The Fed itself, to be sure, is increasingly divided over its next steps, and many economists expect that two members of the Fed's governing board \u2014 both appointed by Trump \u2014 could dissent on Wednesday in favor of cutting rates. If so, that would be the first time two governors vote against the chair since 1993.",
      "Even so, the gap between the views of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee, chaired by Powell, and the White House is unusually large. In several areas, Trump's views sharply contrast with that of the Fed's leadership, setting up likely clashes for years to come, even after Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "For example, Trump says that because the U.S. economy is doing well, the Fed should cut rates, as if the U.S. is a blue-chip company that should pay less to borrow than a risky start-up.",
      "But Fed officials \u2014 and nearly all economists \u2014 see it the other way: A solid economy means rates should be relatively high, to prevent overheating and a burst of inflation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d argue that our interest rates are higher because our economy\u2019s doing fairly well, not in spite of it,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities.",
      "Trump argues that the Fed in general and Powell in particular are costing U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in interest payments by not reducing borrowing costs. Yet Fed officials don't think it's their job to reduce rates the government pays on Treasury notes and bonds.",
      "Most economists worry that if they did, they would risk failing at one of the key jobs Congress gave them: fighting inflation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s using monetary policy to ease pressure on fiscal policymakers, and that way points to higher inflation and bigger problems down the road,\" said William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and former senior Fed staffer.",
      "If financial markets see that the Fed is focused on keeping borrowing costs low to help the government \u2014 rather than focusing on its congressionally-mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment \u2014 Wall Street investors, worried about future inflation, will likely demand higher interest rates to hold Treasury bonds, economists say, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.",
      "For his part, Trump says there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and so the Fed should reduce its short-term rate, currently at about 4.3%, which was ramped up in 2022 and 2023 to fight rising prices. The Fed\u2019s rate often \u2014 but not always \u2014 influences longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.",
      "Inflation has fallen sharply and as a result Fed officials have signaled they will cut rates by as much as a half-percentage point this year. Yet it has picked up a bit in the last two months and many of those policymakers, including Powell, still want to make sure that tariffs aren't going to lift inflation much higher before they make a move.",
      "Inflation accelerated to 2.7% in June from 2.4% in May, the government said earlier this month, above the Fed's 2% target. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose to 2.9% from 2.8%.",
      "Last week, Trump and several White House officials ramped up their attacks on Powell over rates. They also criticized the ballooning costs of the Fed's renovation of two of its buildings, raising questions over whether the president was looking to fire Powell for cause rather than policy differences.",

      "Trump and Powell engaged in an extraordinary on-camera confrontation over the cost of the project during Trump's visit to the building site last Thursday. On Monday, Trump was more restrained in his comments on the Fed during a joint appearance in London with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",

      "But he added, \u201ca smart person would cut.\"",
      "Some economists expect that the Fed will reduce its key rate by a quarter-point in September, rather than July, and say that the two-month delay will make little difference to the economy.",
      "Yet beyond just the timing of the first cut, there is still a huge gulf between what Trump wants and what the Fed will even consider doing: Fed officials in June penciled in just two reductions this year and one in 2026. They forecast that their key rate will still be 3.6% at the end of next year. Trump is pushing them to cut it to just 1%.",
      "\u201cThat's not going to happen with anything like the current people on the committee,\u201d English said.",
      "Wall Street investors also expect relatively few cuts: Two this year and two in 2026, according to futures pricing tracked by CME's Fedwatch.",
      "According to the Fed's projections, just two officials in June supported three cuts this year, likely Trump's appointments from his first term: governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.",
      "Waller gave a speech earlier this month supporting a rate reduction in July, but for a very different reason than Trump: He is worried the economy is faltering.",
      "\u201cThe economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly, and the risks\u201d of rising unemployment \u201chave increased,\u201d Waller said.",

      "Yet most Fed officials see the job market as relatively healthy \u2014 with unemployment at a low 4.1% \u2014 and that as a result, they can take time to make sure that's how everything plays out.",
      "\u201cContinued overall solid economic conditions enable the Fed to take the time to carefully assess the wide range of incoming data,\u201d said Susan Collins, president of the Boston Federal Reserve. \u201cThus, in my view, an \u2018actively patient\u2019 approach to monetary policy remains appropriate at this time.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump may have gotten his way with tariffs on some countries, but his overhaul of American trade policy has not gone unchallenged",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has been getting his way on trade, strong-arming the European Union, Japan and other partners to accept once unthinkably high taxes on their exports to the United States.",
      "But his radical overhaul of American trade policy, in which he's bypassed Congress to slam big tariffs on most of the world's economies, has not gone unchallenged. He's facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he's overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out.",
      "And they won Round One.",
      "In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, ruled that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country in the world. In reaching its decision, the court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "Now it goes on to Round Two.",
      "On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down.",
      "That court earlier allowed the federal government to continue collecting Trump\u2019s tariffs as the case works its way through the judicial system.",
      "The issues are so weighty \u2014 involving the president\u2019s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad \u2014 that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides.",
      "Trump is an unabashed fan of tariffs. He sees the import taxes as an all-purpose economic tool that can bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect American industries, raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts in his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u2019\u2019 pressure countries into bending to his will, even end wars.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes \u2014 including tariffs \u2014 to Congress. But lawmakers have gradually relinquished power over trade policy to the White House. And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "At issue in the pending court case is Trump\u2019s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes.",

They also note that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u2019\u2019 threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits \u2014 in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them \u2014 for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Luis Su\u00e1rez had the winning penalty kick, and Inter Miami rallied to beat Necaxa in the Leagues Cup on Saturday night after losing Lionel Messi to a hamstring injury in the opening minutes.",

      "Messi was injured around the eighth minute when he fell while being challenged by a pair of defenders near the penalty area.

      "Inter Miami played down a man for much of regulation after Maxi Falc\u00f3n was ejected with a red card in the opening minutes. Necaxa defender Cristian Calder\u00f3n was sent off in the 60th after being shown a second yellow card, so both clubs played with 10 men the rest of the way.",
      "Telasco Segovia put his side ahead 1-0 minute after Messi exited on a feed from Inter Miami newcomer Rodrigo De Paul, who had two assists in just his second match with the club. It was Segovia's second goal of the tournament.",

      "Oscar Piastri is happy to be back in Hungary this week after taking his first career Formula 1 win there a year ago",
      "Some Formula 1 races live in the memory because of thrilling action, some for controversy, some even for being so dull they forced a rule change.",
      "And then there's Oscar Piastri's first F1 win, the benchmark for sheer awkwardness.",
      "Piastri is happy to be back in Hungary this week, but his breakthrough victory there last year remains a lesson for McLaren as it tries to manage his title fight with teammate Lando Norris.",
      "It's all the more important now. Piastri has developed into a genuine title contender over the last year and leads Norris by 16 points following his victory in Belgium last week.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of confidence in myself that I can do it,\u201d the Australian said of his title chances Thursday. \u201cThe pace in the last few weekends, especially (Belgium), I\u2019ve been very confident in and very proud of. I\u2019m more than capable of continuing that for the rest of the year.\u201d",
      "McLaren can reach some milestones this weekend, with a potential 200th win in F1 for the team. It could also be Piastri and Norris' fourth one-two finish in a row, a feat McLaren last managed in 1988.",
      "Piastri took the win last year in Hungary, but only after McLaren had to plead over the radio with Norris to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and let Piastri past, something the British driver was reluctant to do.",
      "Piastri had been leading but McLaren's pit strategy \u2014 which would normally favor the leader \u2014 had put Norris ahead. Piastri thinks the team can still take positives from that situation.",
      "\u201cI think it underlined the good nature in the team. It was obviously a slightly awkward situation, but it highlighted that we will do the right thing in all circumstances -- well, ideally all circumstances -- when we\u2019re on track,\u201d Piastri said.",
      "\u201cIt showed the trust that we have with the team and with each other as well, that things will be put the right way.\u201d",
      "F1 has a history of title fights turning team relationships sour \u2014 not least at McLaren with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost over 30 years ago \u2014 but Piastri and Norris have kept their rivalry friendly. Even so, there\u2019s been a collision in Canada, a near-miss in Austria and Piastri's rejected request for Norris to give up the lead in Britain.",

      "\u201c(Visibility) is always much worse in the car than it looks on TV, and I think the FIA has done a very good job of listening to us and taking that feedback on board,\u201d Piastri said. \u201cThe feeling in this room would be pretty different if we had a big crash last week.\u201d",

      "Linda and Tim Pierce have welcomed a baby boy using a 30-year-old embryo",
      "A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth.",
      "In what's known as embryo adoption, Linda and Tim Pierce used a handful of embryos donated in 1994 in pursuit of having a child after fighting infertility for years. Their son was born Saturday from an embryo that had been in storage for 11,148 days, which the Pierces\u2019 doctor says sets a record.",
      "It\u2019s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home.",
      "\u201cI felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,\u201d said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces.",
      "Just about 2% of births in the U.S. are the result of in vitro fertilization, and an even smaller fraction involve donated embryos.",
      "However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs.",
      "Further complicating the topic is a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that said that frozen embryos have the legal status of children. State leaders have since devised a temporary solution shielding clinics from liability stemming from that ruling, though questions linger about remaining embryos.",
      "Archerd says she turned to IVF in 1994. Back then, the ability to freeze, thaw and transfer embryos was making key progress and opening the door for hopeful parents to create more embryos and increase their chances of a successful transfer.",
      "She wound up with four embryos and initially hoped to use them all. But after the birth of her daughter, Archerd and her husband divorced, disrupting her timeline for having more children.",
      "As the years turned into decades, Archerd said she was wracked with guilt about what to do with the embryos as storage fees continued to rise.",
      "Eventually, she found Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which offers open adoptions to donors that allows people like Archerd. She was also able to set preferences for what families would adopt her embryos.",

      "\u201cI wanted to be a part of this baby\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wanted to know the adopting parents.\u201d",
      "The process was tricky, requiring Archerd to contact her initial fertility doctor in Oregon and dig through paper records to get the proper documentation for the donation. The embryos then had to be shipped from Oregon to the Pierces\u2019 doctor in Tennessee. The clinic, Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, refuses to discard frozen embryos and has become known for handling embryos stored in outdated and older containers.",
      "Of the three donated embryos the Pierces received from Archerd, one didn\u2019t make the thaw. Two were transferred to Lindsey Pierce\u2019s womb, but just one successfully implanted.",
      "According to Dr. John David Gordon, the transfer of the nearly 31-year-old embryo marks the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. He would know, Gordon says his clinic assisted in the previous record, when Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 30 years, or 10,905 days.",
      "\u201cI think that these stories catch the imagination,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lindsey and Tim Pierce said the clinic\u2019s support was just what they needed.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this thinking about records \u2014 we just wanted to have a baby,\u201d Lindsey Pierce said.",
      "For Archerd, the donation process has been an emotional roller coaster. Relief that her embryos finally found a home, sadness it couldn\u2019t be with her and a little anxiety about what the future holds next, with possibly meeting the Pierces and the baby in person.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019re going to send pictures,\u201d she said, noting that the parents have already sent several after the birth. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet \u2014 meet them and the baby.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is a kingmaker on X",
      "ROME -- Hard-right commentators, politicians and activists in Europe have uncovered a secret to expanding their influence: engaging with Elon Musk.",
      "Take the German politician from a party whose own domestic intelligence agency has designated as extremist. Her daily audience on X surged from 230,000 to 2.2 million on days Musk interacted with her posts. She went on to lead her party to its best-ever electoral showing.",
      "Or the anti-immigration activist in Britain, who was banned from Twitter and sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. Since Musk let him back on the platform in late 2023, he\u2019s mentioned, reposted or replied to the billionaire more than 120 times on X \u2014 and gained nearly a million followers.",
      "Even a little-known social-media influencer turned politician from Cyprus has benefited from the Musk effect. Before winning a surprise seat in the European Parliament, where he\u2019s advocated for Musk, the influencer seemed to have one ambition: to hug the world\u2019s richest man. He got his hug \u2014 and political endorsements. On days Musk has interacted with his account on X, the man\u2019s audience exploded from just over 300,000 to nearly 10 million views.",
      "Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington -- he stepped down as an adviser to President Donald Trump in May and has since traded insults with the president -- but as he works to build his own political party, his power on X his power remains unchecked.",
      "Musk\u2019s influence on the platform he bought for $44 billion has made him a kingmaker at home and abroad. Among those he has chosen to cultivate are hard-right politicians and insurgent influencers across Europe, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data. His dominance, which has real-world financial and political impacts, is fueling concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China this time, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d said Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation. \u201cWe need to make sure that power is not unbalanced.\u201d",
      "In seeking to quantify Musk\u2019s effect on European politics, The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts over a three-year period from 11 far-right European figures across six countries who frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda and had significant interactions with Elon Musk since he purchased Twitter. Tens of thousands of posts by Musk on Twitter, now known as X, were also collected.",
      "The AP used the records, obtained from data provider Bright Data, to analyze how Musk\u2019s account interacted with the European influencers, and vice versa, and the extent to which Musk\u2019s engagement boosted their reach.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather, they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers who share his views.",
      "Due to limitations on data collection, the dataset is not a complete record of all posts made by these accounts. Even so, it captured at least 920 instances in which one of the European accounts tagged, replied or otherwise attempted to interact with Musk\u2019s account, and at nearly 190 instances where Musk\u2019s own posts interacted with the Europeans.",
      "The AP also analyzed records of daily follower counts, using data from Social Blade, to measure any growth in the European accounts\u2019 audience that occurred in the wake of Musk\u2019s online interactions. This kind of analysis is no longer possible. In March, Social Blade removed X from its analytics, saying that X had increased its data access fees to prohibitive levels, making the platform harder to research.",
      "Among those included in AP\u2019s analysis are several people who have run into legal trouble in their own countries. An anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., for example, was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. A German politician was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech. An Italian vice premier was acquitted in December of illegally detaining 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship.",
      "Others examined by AP were an influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right;\u201d a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington, D.C.; and two politicians who have advocated for the interests of Musk\u2019s companies as those firms seek to expand in Europe.",
      "AP\u2019s analysis shows how Musk is helping unite nationalists across borders in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech. While his efforts have sparked backlash in some countries, Musk\u2019s promotion of a growing alliance of hard-right parties and individuals has helped rattle the foundation of a transatlantic bond that has guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Engagement from Musk does not guarantee a surge in followers or page views. But AP found it can have a huge impact, especially on up-and-coming influencers. One account that began with around 120,000 followers when Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 topped 1.2 million by January of this year. Seven other European accounts saw six-figure increases in their follower counts over the same period.",
      "Most of the 11 accounts examined saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers. Even some that grew more steadily on their own before Musk interacted with them saw their follower counts rise sharply after he began engaging with their posts. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, its account saw its views soar \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "Musk is not the only factor influencing the growth of these accounts, of course, but their rising fortunes are a measure of how the platform has evolved under his leadership. When Musk acquired X, he pledged to turn it into a haven for free speech, declaring himself a \u201cfree speech absolutist.\u201d AP\u2019s analysis adds to growing evidence that instead of serving as a neutral forum for free speech, X amplifies Musk\u2019s speech.",
      "This shift has given him sweeping power to direct people\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme asymmetry in the way Musk is able to leverage and shape the platform,\u201d said Timothy Graham, an associate professor in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who has studied data anomalies on X. \u201cThere\u2019s an unequivocal sense when you go onto the site that you\u2019re entering Musk\u2019s kingdom.\u201d",
      "Since he acquired Twitter in 2022, Musk has come to dominate the platform. His followers have more than doubled, to more than 220 million \u2014 growth so tremendous that it easily outpaced the other Top 10 accounts. Not even Taylor Swift has been able to keep up.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose followers grew by 21 million \u2014 or 25% \u2014 from October 2022 through January, clocked a distant second. Donald Trump\u2019s followers grew by 14%, or around 12 million, while Taylor Swift mustered a mere 3% growth, or 3 million new followers.",
      "None of the other Top 10 accounts have shown such consistent follower growth, month after month, AP found. The result is a further concentration of power for the world\u2019s richest man, who now commands the most popular account on a social media platform used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.",
      "Given the opacity of the algorithms that power X, it\u2019s hard to determine with certainty what array of factors might be driving such unusual \u2014 and unusually consistent \u2014 growth in Musk\u2019s account. But researchers who have analyzed data patterns on X argue that the platform\u2019s algorithm has, at times, been altered to amplify Musk\u2019s voice.",
      "How X promotes content is a growing point of contention in Europe. In January, the European Union expanded its investigation of X to assess how the platform pushes content to users and why some material goes viral. In February, French prosecutors opened a separate investigation into X over allegations that Musk changed the platform\u2019s algorithms to promote biased content.",
      "Musk\u2019s public attacks on left-leaning politicians, support for hard-right policies and loose handling of facts have prompted rebukes from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.",
      "X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk\u2019s dominance creates a strong incentive for people seeking to increase their clout \u2014 or their revenues, through the platform\u2019s monetization options \u2014 to exploit these network effects and try to get Musk to engage with their content.",
      "\u201cPeople know that he\u2019s gearing everything towards him,\u201d said Graham, the digital media scholar in Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to get close to this person because he is the moneymaker.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, for example, has benefited from the Musk effect. AfD coleader Alice Weidel helped lead the party, which advocates for nationalist and anti-immigrant policies, to second place in German parliamentary elections in February.",
      "When Musk interacted with her account in the run-up to those elections, the average number of daily views she got rose from about 230,000 to 2.2 million.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in May classified Weidel\u2019s party as a right-wing extremist organization, which would subject the AfD to greater surveillance. The party, which maintains that it\u2019s a victim of politically motivated defamation, promptly filed a lawsuit against the move, which Musk, along with top U.S. officials blasted as an attack on free speech. The designation has been suspended pending judicial review.",

      "The chat has gotten 16 million views. Musk also appeared at AfD rallies and endorsed the party in a German newspaper.",
      "AfD officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Naomi Seibt, a German climate skeptic, pinged Musk nearly 600 times between October 2022 and Jan. 2025. Musk finally engaged in June 2024, when he asked her to explain why the AfD is so controversial in Germany.",
      "Since then, Musk has replied to, quoted or tagged Seibt more than 50 times, and her followers have grown by more than 320,000 since Musk took over the platform. On days Musk interacted with Seibt, her posts, on average, got 2.6 times as many views.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally \u2018invade\u2019 Elon\u2019s algorithm,\u201d Seibt told AP. \u201cObviously Elon has a lot of influence and can help share a message even with those who are usually glued to the legacy media, particularly in Germany.\u201d",
      "Seibt said she\u2019s now living in the United States because she fears political persecution in Europe. \u201cWashington DC is the political heart of America and thus also the safest place for me to be,\u201d she said. \u201cI fear the German state wants me locked up.\u201d",
      "Musk has also boosted the influence of political insurgents in the U.K. Days before British national elections last July, Musk took to X to ask Nigel Farage, the leader of the populist Reform U.K. party: \u201cWhy does the media keep calling you far-right? What are your policies?\u201d",
      "Farage replied eagerly: \u201cBecause we believe in family, country and strong borders. Call me!\u201d",
      "Such interactions from Musk helped Farage more than triple his daily audience. Farage did not reply to requests for comment.",
      "In Spain, Rub\u00e9n Pulido, a columnist for a newspaper published by the populist Vox party\u2019s think tank, hit the jackpot in August, when Musk responded to two posts in which he argued that rescue boats operated by nongovernmental organizations effectively help smugglers move migrants to Europe. Pulido\u2019s visibility soared. On days Musk engaged with him, his account got nearly 300,000 views \u2014 roughly three times more than usual.",
      "When Musk didn\u2019t interact with Pulido\u2019s account, the results were just as clear. In January, he again inveighed against migrant rescues and sought to get Musk\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cHi @elonmusk! Speak up,\u201d he urged.",
      "Three weeks later, he tweeted: \u201cPerhaps @elonmusk might find this interesting.\u201d",
      "That post garnered just 5,128 views.",
      "Pulido did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "While Musk helped boost the accounts of such fringe parties and rising influencers, his interactions did not provide as stark a benefit to more established politicians, AP found. That was true for both Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, and Dutch politician Geert Wilders, an anti-Islamic firebrand who has been called the Dutch Donald Trump.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions online have spilled into political endorsements, policy advocacy -- and money.",
      "X helps users monetize their accounts, through ad revenue sharing and paid subscription programs as well as direct fundraising links. That means a surge in attention on X can bring a surge in revenue.",
      "Tommy Robinson, a British anti-immigration agitator who was released from prison in May, after serving a reduced sentence of seven months for contempt of court, has a link to his fundraising page on his X profile. Interactions from Musk more than doubled Robinson\u2019s daily views, from around 380,000 to nearly 850,000. Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 could not be reached for comment",
      "Radio Genoa, an account reportedly investigated by Italian authorities last year for allegedly spreading hate speech about migrants, used X to publicize a call for a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for legal defense. Radio Genoa has pinged Musk dozens of times over the last three years, and for good reason: On days Musk engaged with him, the views on his account doubled. Radio Genoa\u2019s followers surged from less than 200,000 before Musk\u2019s engagement to over 1.2 million. Radio Genoa could not be reached for comment.",
      "Eva Vlaardingerbroek -- a conservative Dutch political commentator dubbed the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d whose account Musk has engaged with three dozen times -- uses X to solicit tips and has creator status, which allows her to charge subscription fees. So does Seibt, the German activist -- though she told AP her earnings from X aren\u2019t enough to sustain herself. Vlaardingerbroek did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk has also advocated for Matteo Salvini, vice premier of Italy and the leader of the hard-right, anti-migrant League party. On X, Musk\u2019s interactions boosted Salvini\u2019s daily visibility more than fourfold. Offline, Salvini has urged Italy to move ahead with controversial contracts for Starlink and pushed back against EU efforts to regulate content on X.",
      "Before Fidias Panayiotou \u2014 a 25-year-old social media influencer from Cyprus with no political experience \u2014 won a surprise seat as an independent in the European Parliament last year, he spent weeks camped outside Twitter and Space X headquarters in a highly publicized quest to hug the world\u2019s richest man. In January 2023, his wish came true. Their embrace went viral.",
      "Soon, Musk was interacting with Panayiotou\u2019s posts on a variety of subjects, expanding his typical audience on X by more than 3,000%.",
      "Since taking his seat, Panayiotou -- whose positions often also reflect the views of Cyprus\u2019 traditional leftist establishment -- has praised X on the floor of the European Parliament, pushed back against regulations that impact the platform, and credited Musk with sparking his call to fire 80% of EU bureaucrats.",
      "Musk, evidently, was pleased. \u201cVote for Fidias,\u201d he posted on X, an endorsement that was viewed more than 11.5 million times. \u201cHe is smart, super high energy and genuinely cares about you!\u201d",
      "In July, after AP asked for comment, Panayiotou posted a video to dispel any impression that he was Musk\u2019s puppet. \u201cI don\u2019t have any relationship with Elon Musk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken at all since we hugged, neither through messages, nor by phone, and I\u2019ve never invited him anywhere.\u201d",
      "He said that Musk, unprompted, began reposting his content after he was elected to the European Parliament.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a danger to democracy honestly that Elon Musk supports me,\u201d Panayiotou explained in another video. \u201cI think this is the beauty of democracy.\u201d",

A retweet or reply from Musk can lead to millions of views and tens of thousands of new followers, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data.",

      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation, told AP.",

      "Since acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Elon Musk\u2019s followers have more than doubled, to over 220 million. No other large account has shown such high or consistent growth.",
      "The result: If Musk\u2019s X account is his megaphone, it has gotten a lot bigger since he took over -- a change that has global implications.",
      "The accounts Musk has been promoting are part of a growing global alliance of nationalistic parties and individuals united in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech, which has rattled the foundation of a trans-Atlantic bond that guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Several of the accounts AP analyzed belong to people who have faced allegations of illegal behavior in their own countries. Tommy Robinson, an anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee.

      "These accounts collectively gained roughly 5 million followers from the time Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 through January of this year. Most saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers -- as high as 920%, or in one case of a tiny account exploding over that time, topping 6,000%.

      "A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google\u2019s Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that\u2019s designed to give consumers more choices",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google's Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that's designed to give consumers more choices.",
      "The unanimous ruling issued Thursday by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivers a double-barreled legal blow for Google, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials that resulted in different pillars of its internet empire being declared as domineering scofflaws monopolies since late 2023.",
      "The unsuccessful appeal represents a major victory for video game maker Epic Games, which launched a legal crusade targeting Google\u2019s Play Store for Android apps and Apple\u2019s iPhone app store nearly five years ago in an attempt to bypass exclusive payment processing systems that charged 15% to 30% commissions on in-app transactions.",
      "The jury's December 2023 rebuke of Google's app store for Android-powered smartphones began a cascade of setbacks that includes monopoly judgements against the company's ubiquitous search engine last year and the technology underlying its digital ad network earlier this year.",
      "Although not as lucrative as Google's search engine or ad system, the Play Store for Android apps has long been a gold mine that generated billions of dollars in annual revenue by taking a 15% to 30% cut from in-app transactions funneled through the company's own payment processing system.",
      "Following a month-long trial, a nine-person jury determined that Google had rigged its system to thwart alternative app stores from offering better deals to consumers and software developers. That verdict resulted in U.S. District Judge James Donato ordering Google to tear down digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition, triggering the company's appeal to overturn the jury's finding and void the judge's mandated shakeup.",
      "But a three-judge panel that heard Google's appeal in February rejected its lawyers' contention that Donato erred by allowing the case to be determined by a jury that deviated from the market definition outlined by another federal judge who mostly sided with Apple in Epic's case against the iPhone maker's app store.",
      "Epic's lawsuit \"was replete with evidence that Google\u2019s anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance, causing the Play Store to benefit from network effects,\" the judges wrote in the decision.",

      "Unless Google can extend the enforcement delay placed on Donato's order issued last October, the company will have to begin an overhaul that includes making the Play Store's entire library of more than 2 million Android apps available to would-be rivals and also help distribute the alternative options. Google has argued that the required revisions will raise privacy and security risks by exposing consumers to scam artists and hackers masquerading as legitimate app stores.",
      "But Epic's lawyers have ridiculed Google's warnings about the changes as scare tactics in a desperate attempt to protect the fortunes of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc.",
      "Although Epic fell short in its attempt to have the iPhone's app store declared a monopoly, that case resulted in a judge issuing an order that required Apple to surrender exclusive control over the payment processing of in-app transactions and allow links to alternative systems without collecting a commission.",
      "Besides being hit with Donato's order, Google still faces further trouble ahead that could leave an even bigger dent in its finances.",
      "As part of the effort to address Google\u2019s illegal monopoly in search, a federal judge is weighing a proposal by the U.S. Justice Department that would require the sale of its Chrome web browser and ban the multibillion dollar deals that company has been making with Apple and others to lock-in its search engine as the main gateway to the internet.",
      "Google is also facing a proposed breakup of its advertising technology as part of the countermeasures to its monopoly in that business. A trial on that proposal is scheduled to begin in September.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A 12-year-old boy died from a brain-eating amoeba two weeks after a holiday weekend on a popular South Carolina lake.",
      "The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.",
      "It causes an infection that swells the brain and destroys tissue. Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but almost all are fatal.",
      "Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:",
      "The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",
      "It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.",
      "Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "He got sick several days later and died on July 18.",
      "His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.",
      "Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn\u2019t closed and no water testing was performed.",

      "Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.",

      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",
      "There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.",
      "A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "MOKOPANE, South Africa -- A South African university launched an anti-poaching campaign Thursday to inject the horns of rhinos with radioactive isotopes that it says are harmless for the animals but can be detected by customs agents.",
      "Under the collaborative project involving the University of the Witwatersrand, nuclear energy officials and conservationists, five rhinos were injected in what the university hopes will be the start of a mass injection of the declining rhino population.",
      "They're calling it the Rhisotope Project.",
      "Last year, about 20 rhinos at a sanctuary were injected with isotopes in trials that paved the way for Thursday's launch. The radioactive isotopes even at low levels can be recognized by radiation detectors at airports and borders, leading to the arrest of poachers and traffickers.",
      "Researchers at Witwatersrand's Radiation and Health Physics Unit say that tests conducted in the pilot study confirmed that the radioactive material was not harmful to the rhinos.",
      "\u201cWe have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,\u201d said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project.",
      "\u201cEven a single horn with significantly lower levels of radioactivity than what will be used in practice successfully triggered alarms in radiation detectors,\u201d said Larkin.",
      "The tests also found that horns could be detected inside full 40-foot shipping containers, he said.",

Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",

At the time, NOAA said the cutoff was said \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" while the U.S. Navy said the program didn't meet \"information technology modernization requirements.\u201d The discontinuation was postponed for one month.",

      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",

      "Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said \u2014 increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency will continue to have access to the data for the program\u2019s lifespan and noted that it is just one data set \u201cin a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\" that the National Weather Service has at its disposal to \u201censure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",

Republicans and business interests have long criticized NEPA for what they see as unreasonable slowing of development, and Trump\u2019s plan would give \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d to data centers for \u201cmaximum efficiency\u201d in permitting.",
      "A spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality said the administration is \u201cfocused on driving meaningful NEPA reform to reduce the delays in federal permitting, unleashing the ability for America to strengthen its AI and manufacturing leadership.\"",
      "Trump's administration has been weakening the law for months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course for this administration. The attitude is to clear the way for projects that harm communities and the environment,\u201d said Erin Doran, senior staff attorney at environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch.",
      "Here's what to know about this key environmental law, and Trump's effort to weaken it:",
      "NEPA is a foundational environmental law in the United States, \u201cessentially our Magna Carta for the environment,\u201d said Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, referring to the 13th century English legal text that formed the basis for constitutions worldwide.",
      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "Separately, the U.S. Supreme Court in May narrowed the scope of environmental reviews required for major infrastructure projects.

      "\"It's been a rough eight months for NEPA,\u201d said Dinah Bear, a former general counsel at the Council on Environmental Quality under both Democratic and Republican presidents.",
      "John Ruple, a research professor of law at the University of Utah, said sidelining NEPA could actually slow things down. Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act. NEPA has an often overlooked benefit of forcing coordination with those other laws, he said.",
      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept: \u2018Don\u2019t just roar ahead.\u2019 Think about your options,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien, who later worked at the Grand Canyon Trust, also co-chaired a working group that weighed in on a 2012 Forest Service proposal, finalized in 2016, for aspen restoration on Monroe Mountain in Utah. Hunters, landowners, loggers and ranchers all had different opinions on how the restoration should be handled. She said NEPA\u2019s requirement to get the public involved made for better research and a better plan.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the laws that\u2019s the most often used by the public without the public being aware,\u201d said Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice. \u201cNEPA has long been the one opportunity for communities and impacted stakeholders and local governments to weigh in.\u201d",
      "Schima said rolling back the power of NEPA threatens the scientific integrity of examining projects' full impacts.",
      "\u201cDecisions are going to be less informed by scientific studies, and that is one of the major concerns here,'' he said.",
      "Ruple said uncertainty from NEPA changes and competing opinions on how to comply with the law's requirements may invite even more litigation.",

    "story": [
      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

She's also narrated long-form articles for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair.",
      "You may have read her own writing, too. Whelan's first novel, 2018's \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d has been adapted to a Netflix film, out Friday, starring Sofia Carson. The story actually began as a screenplay by Allison Burnett and had been gestating in development for years. Whelan was brought in to help with the script because she had studied abroad at Oxford her junior year of college. Producers then asked if she thought it would make a good book.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing has ever wanted to be a book more. Please let me do this,'\u201d she recalls. It ended up an international bestseller. Her second novel, 2022's \u201cThank You For Listening,\u201d was critically praised. (\u201cThank You For Listening\u201d is about a former actor-turned-audiobook narrator who falls in love with another audiobook narrator.)",
      "You may have even seen Whelan on TV \u2014 she began her career as a child actor, with roles in \u201cFifteen and Pregnant\u201d and on the series \u201cOnce and Again.\u201d Despite her various pursuits, though, she has no plans to leave narration behind. \u201cI feel like I was born to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I love and that I\u2019m good at and everything I want to be doing.\u201d",
      "That's a good thing, because the audiobook industry is growing. Statista projects this year it will reach $9.84 billion because of smartphones, the increased popularity of audio content and people's desire to multitask. Despite the appetite for audiobooks, for narrators, \u201cthe financial aspect makes zero sense,\u201d says Whelan. She's founded her own publishing company, Audiobrary, to help narrators get paid more fairly.",
      "Whelan, who has narrated as many as 70 books in one year, spoke to The Associated Press about the audiobook industry, Audiobrary and her own writing. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

You\u2019re messed up for three or four months. Everything just gets delayed, especially when I was doing 70 books a year, there\u2019s no room for error there.",

But I think that audiobook fans \u2014 not your casual audiobook user, but fans \u2014 have favorite narrators and they\u2019re going to look for books by those narrators. So, in stunt-casting situations, sometimes someone is incredible at it, and they are perfect for the book. But sometimes it feels like a very craven, just marketing ploy. I don\u2019t feel infringed upon by them, but I do worry about a future situation where most of the work is going to AI.

So then are you telling them they\u2019ve never read a book before? Actual data and studies show that listening to a book actually triggers the same response in the brain as reading it, and that the interpretation and understanding of that book is on par with having read it.",

      "WHELAN: I very much think we could. I have said no up to this point because, this time around, I want to be very creatively involved. There\u2019s just too many things about audiobooks that someone could get wrong not knowing anything about the industry.

      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, speaking with \"War Room\" host and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, said on Thursday, \"The House rules and the Senate rules both allow for these people to be arrested if they leave ... The challenge is, if they go out of state, we lose jurisdiction, and that -- it's been a challenge in the past, but in the end, as long as the governor is willing to keep calling sessions, ultimately they have to come home.\"",
      "Paxton also said he was not worried about defending the maps in court: \"We've got, we've got good maps. And the legislature has the right to draw the maps they want. They're politically based, not race-based. And if they're politically based, then they're defensible.\"",
      "Some of the Democratic legislators fleeing the state will appear on Sunday evening with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker at a press conference. Pritzker has been a staunch supporter of Texas Democrats and has floated the possibility of getting Illinois' own congressional maps redrawn if Texas redraws its maps. Illinois' maps have been criticized by outside observers as highly partisan in favor of Democrats.",
      "In late June, the chair of the Texas Democrats, Kendall Scudder, flew from Dallas to Oklahoma to see Pritzker, who was giving remarks at the state Democratic Party's dinner. The pair had a private meeting during that time to talk about the possibility of lawmakers fleeing the state to Illinois -- and if they were to flee the state, that they would have a place they would feel safe and supported.",
      "Since then, Pritzker and Texas Democrats have been in touch, and a small group of them traveled to Chicago in July when members of the delegation left for Illinois and California for brief meetings.",
      "Pritzker and his team have been helping behind the scenes to help find hotels in the area for the Democrats, help their operation, and grease the wheels so things go smoothly for them as they head to Illinois.",
      "The bill containing the maps had been scheduled to be taken up on the state House floor on Monday.",

      "China has taken a firm stance against U.S. demands.",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\u201cChina will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\u201d China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\u201cCoercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \u201ctough\u201d negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \u201cI believe that we have the makings of a deal,\u201d Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \u201cRealizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\u201d for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "When Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China\u2019s consistent official stance,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \u201cthe one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Trump has made it clear he wants a \u201cheadline-grabbing deal\u201d with Xi, \u201cso rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \u201cstrategic solidarity\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\u201cBeijing simply can\u2019t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A video showing the violent arrest of a Black college student in Florida has sparked calls for drivers to use cameras that show a view from inside their car",
      "A video that captured the brutal arrest of a Black college student pulled from his car and beaten by officers in Florida has led to an investigation and calls for motorists to consider protecting themselves by placing a camera inside their vehicles.",
      "William McNeil Jr. captured his February traffic stop on his cellphone camera, which was mounted above his dashboard. It offered a unique view, providing the only clear footage of the violence by officers, including punches to his head that can't clearly be seen in officer body camera footage released by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.",
      "Since McNeil had the foresight to record the encounter from inside the vehicle, \u201cwe got to see firsthand and hear firsthand and put it all in context what driving while Black is in America,\u201d said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, one of several lawyers advising McNeil.",
      "\u201cAll the young people should be recording these interactions with law enforcement,\" Crump said. Because what it tells us, just like with George Floyd, if we don\u2019t record the video, we can see what they put in the police report with George Floyd before they realized the video existed.\u201d",
      "McNeil was pulled over that day because officers said his headlights should have been on due to bad weather, his lawyers said. His camera shows him asking the officers what he did wrong. Seconds later, an officer smashes his window, strikes him as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat and then pulls him from the car and punches him in the head. After being knocked to the ground, McNeil was punched six more times in his right thigh, a police report states.",
      "The incident reports don't describe the officer punching McNeil in the head. The officer, who pulled McNeil over and then struck him, described the force this way in his report: \u201cPhysical force was applied to the suspect and he was taken to the ground.\u201d",
      "But after McNeil posted his video online last month and it went viral, the sheriff's office launched an internal investigation, which is ongoing. A sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson declined to comment about the case this week, citing pending litigation, though no lawsuit has been filed over the arrest.",
      "McNeil said the ordeal left him traumatized, with a brain injury, a broken tooth and several stiches in his lip. His attorneys accused the sheriff's office of trying to cover up what really happened.",
      "\u201cOn Feb. 19, 2025, Americans saw what America is,\u201d said another of McNeil\u2019s lawyers, Harry Daniels. \u201cWe saw injustice. You saw abuse of police power. But most importantly we saw a young man that had a temperament to control himself in the face of brutality.\u201d",
      "The traffic stop, he said, was not only racially motivated but \u201cit was unlawful, and everything that stemmed from that stop was unlawful.\"",
      "McNeil is hardly the first Black motorist to record video during a traffic stop that turned violent \u2014 Philando Castile's girlfriend livestreamed the bloody aftermath of his death during a 2016 traffic stop near Minneapolis. But McNeil's arrest serves as a reminder of how cellphone video can show a different version of events than what is described in police reports, his lawyers said.",
      "Christopher Mercado, who retired as a lieutenant from the New York Police Department, agreed with McNeil's legal team's suggestion that drivers should record their police interactions and that a camera mounted inside a driver's car could offer a unique point of view.",
      "\"Use technology to your advantage,\" said Mercado, an adjunct assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nefarious about it. It's actually a smart thing in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Rod Brunson, chairman of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, said he thinks it's a good idea for citizens to film encounters with police \u2014 as long as doing so doesn't make the situation worse.",

      "\u201cI think that's a form of protection \u2014 it's safeguarding them against false claims of criminal behavior or interfering with officers, etc.,\u201d Brunson said.",
      "Although the sheriff's office declined to speak to The Associated Press this week, Sheriff T.K. Waters has spoken publicly about McNeil's arrest since video of the encounter went viral. He pushed back against some of the allegations made by McNeil's lawyers, noting that McNeil was told more than a half-dozen times to exit the vehicle.",
      "At a news conference last month, Waters also highlighted images of a knife in McNeil's car. The officer who punched him claimed in his police report that McNeil reached toward the floor of the car, where deputies later found the knife.",
      "Crump, though, said McNeil's video shows that he \u201cnever reaches for anything,\u201d and a second officer wrote in his report that McNeil kept his hands up as the other officer smashed the car window.",
      "A camera inside a motorist's vehicle could make up for some shortcomings of police bodycams, which can have a narrow field of view that becomes more limited the closer an officer gets to the person being filmed, Mercado said.",
      "However, after the police murder of Floyd, some states and cities debated how and when citizens should be able to capture video of police. The Constitution guarantees the right to record police in public, but a point of contention in some states has been whether a civilian's recording might interfere with the ability of officers to do their job. In Louisiana, for example, a new law makes it a crime to approach within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of a police officer in certain situations.",
      "Waters acknowledged those limitations at a news conference last year, as he narrated video of a wild brawl between officers and a fan in the stands at EverBank Stadium during a football game last year between the universities of Georgia and Florida.",
      "The sheriff showed the officers' bodycam videos during the start of the confrontation near the top of the stadium. But when the officers subdued the suspect and were pressing against him, the bodycam footage didn't capture much, so the sheriff switched to stadium security video shot from a longer distance away.",
      "In McNeil's case, the bodycam video didn't clearly capture the punches thrown. If it had, the case would have been investigated right away, the sheriff said.",
      "For the past 20 years, Brunson has been interviewing young Black men in several U.S. cities about their encounters with law enforcement. When he first began submitting research papers for academic review, many readers didn't believe the men's stories of being brutalized by officers.",
      "\u201cPeople who live in a civil society don't expect to be treated this way by the police. For them, their police interactions are mostly pleasant, mostly cordial,\" Brunson said.",
      "\u201cSo it's hard for people who don\u2019t have a tenuous relationship with the police to fathom that something like this happens,\u201d he said. \"And that\u2019s where video does play a big part because people can't deny what they see.\u201d",

      "Texas Democrats have left the state in an attempt to prevent the state House from holding a vote Monday on new congressional maps that Republicans hope will net them several additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections",
      "A standoff in Texas over redrawn U.S. House maps sought by President Donald Trump sharply escalated Sunday when dozens of Democratic legislators left the state to block a vote, followed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott warning them that he will seek their removal from office if they don\u2019t return.",
      "The revolt by Democrats, and Abbott giving them until Monday to come home or face efforts to strip them of their elected positions, pushed a widening fight over congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections into new territory.

Four years ago, House Democrats left Texas for 38 days in protest of new voting restrictions that still wound up passing once the holdout ended.",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever it takes. What that looks like, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Wu said at a Sunday night news conference.",
      "Lawmakers can't pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus. In addition to those in Illinois, delegations of Democratic lawmakers left Texas for Boston and Albany, New York, among other places, Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer said.",

The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \u201cphysically compel the attendance\u201d of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",

      "A long list of things went wrong in January and contributed to the collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines jet over Washington, D",
      "Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people.",
      "The biggest revelations: The helicopter's altimeter gauge was broken, and controllers warned the FAA years earlier about the dangers that helicopters presented.",
      "At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns.",
      "\u201cAre you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead! How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?\u201d she said. \u201cFix it. Do better.\u201d",
      "Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area.",
      "Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying:",
      "The helicopter was flying at 278 feet (85 meters) \u2014 well above the 200-foot (61-meter) ceiling on that route \u2014 when it collided with the airliner. But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder.",
      "The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit.",
      "An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions.",
      "Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off.",
      "But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling.",
      "Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB\u2019s final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash.",
      "\u201cI think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,\u201d aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said.",

      "\u201cThe fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern for me,\u201d said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army\u2019s utility helicopters.",
      "Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan\u2019s secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights.",
      "Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route.",
      "Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA\u2019s air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan \u201cwere really dependent upon the use of visual separation\u201d to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just \u201cmake it work.\u201d They sometimes used \u201csqueeze plays\u201d to land planes with minimal separation.",
      "On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.",
      "The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane\u2019s pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late.",
      "An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said \u201chelicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.\u201d",
      "Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns.",
      "The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision,",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said \u201cevery sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.\u201d But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.",
      "\u201cWhat you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cBut you guys are pointing out, \u2018Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.\u2019\u201d",

      "An Army veteran finds peace through a unique bond with a spider monkey named Louie",
      "PERKINSTON, Miss. -- In the embrace of a cheerfully chittering spider monkey named Louie, an Army veteran who grappled for decades with post-traumatic stress disorder says he finally feels at peace.",
      "\u201cBeing out here has brought a lot of faith back to me,\u201d said John Richard. \u201cThere's no feeling like it.\u201d",
      "The bond began last fall when Richard was helping two married veterans set up the Gulf Coast Primate Sanctuary, volunteering his time to build the enclosure that's now Louie's home in rural southeast Mississippi.",
      "During a recent visit, Louie quickly scampered up Richard's body, wrapping his arms and tail around him in a sort of hug. Richard, in turn, placed his hand on the primate's back and whispered sweetly until Louie disentangled himself and swung away.",
      "\u201cHe's making his little sounds in my ear, and you know, he's always telling you, \u2018Oh, I love you,\u2019\u201d Richard said. \u201c\u2018I know you're OK. I know you're not going to hurt me.\u2019\u201d",
      "Richard said his connection with Louie helped more than any other PTSD treatment he received since being diagnosed more than 20 years ago.",
      "It's a similar story for the sanctuary's founder, April Stewart, an Air Force veteran who said she developed PTSD as a result of military sexual trauma.",
      "\u201cIt was destroying my life. It was like a cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a trauma that was never properly healed.\u201d",
      "Stewart's love of animals was a way to cope. She didn\u2019t necessarily set out to create a place of healing for veterans with PTSD, but that\u2019s what the sanctuary has become for some volunteers.",
      "\u201cBy helping the primates learning to trust, we\u2019re also reteaching ourselves how to trust, and we\u2019re giving ourselves grace with people,\u201d she said.",
      "Her 15-acre property, nestled amid woods and farmland, is filled with rescue dogs, two rather noisy geese and a black cat. It's also now home to three spider monkeys, two squirrel monkeys and two kinkajous, a tropical mammal that is closely related to raccoons.",

      "The sanctuary in the town of Perkinston, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) due north of the Gulf coast, includes three large enclosures for the different species. Each has a smaller, air-conditioned area and a large fenced-in outdoor zone, where the primates swing from platforms and lounge in the sun. Checking on the animals \u2014 changing their blankets, bringing food and water \u2014 is one of the first and last things Stewart does each day.",
      "However, she can't do it alone. She relies on a group of volunteers for help, including several other veterans, and hopes to open the sanctuary to the public next summer for guided educational tours.",
      "Stewart and her husband, also a veteran, decided to open the sanctuary in October after first rescuing and rehoming monkeys. With the help of two exotic-animal veterinarians, they formed a foundation that governs the sanctuary \u2014 which she said is the only primate sanctuary in Mississippi licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 and ensures the animals will be cared for even when the Stewarts are no longer able to run it themselves.",
      "All the animals were once somebody's pet, but their owners eventually couldn't take care of them. Stewart stressed that primates do not make good or easy pets. They need lots of space and socialization, which is often difficult for families to provide.",
      "The sanctuary's goal is to provide as natural a habitat as possible for the animals, Stewart said, and bring them together with their own species.",
      "\u201cThis is their family,\u201d she said.",

      "A jury convicted Maxwell Anderson in June of first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse, arson and hiding a corpse in connection with Sade Robinson's death last year. He maintained his innocence throughout the trial.",
      "During a sentencing hearing that was by turns somber, emotional and horrifying, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Laura Crivello repeatedly questioned how Anderson could commit such a heinous crime. Prosecutors related details of how Anderson cut up Robinson's body and dumped one of her legs in a playground.",
      "Robinson's mother, Sheena Scarborough, said Anderson \u201cmessed the entire community up\" and deserves no protection in prison.",

      "First-degree intentional homicide in Wisconsin carries a mandatory life sentence. The only question for Anderson was whether the judge would allow him to seek parole.",
      "Anderson's attorney, Tony Cotton, asked the judge to make Anderson eligible for parole after 25 years. He argued that Anderson served in the U.S. Navy and suffers from obvious mental health issues.",
      "Cotton acknowledged that Anderson has been convicted of multiple misdemeanor disorderly conduct counts in connection with domestic violence but they're not significant offenses compared to most homicide defendants. He added that he has concerns about Anderson's safety in prison.",

She dismissed Anderson's claims of innocence, saying his view of reality \u201cdiffers from the rest of the world.\" Trailing off at times and shaking her head, she said he's irredeemable, called his crimes \u201cunconscionable\u201d and likened the case to something out of a horror novel.",

      "The National Science Foundation can continue to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars from researchers in several states until litigation aimed at restoring it plays out",
      "NEW YORK -- The National Science Foundation can continue to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars from researchers in several states until litigation aimed at restoring it plays out, a federal court ruled Friday.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Cronan in New York declined to force the NSF to restart payments immediately, while the case is still being decided, as requested by the sixteen Democrat-led states who brought the suit, including New York, Hawaii, California, Colorado and Connecticut.",
      "In his ruling, Cronan said he would not grant the preliminary injunction in part because it may be that another court, the Court of Federal Claims, has jurisdiction over what is essentially a case about money. He also said the states failed to show that NSF\u2019s actions were counter to the agency's mandate.",
      "The lawsuit filed in May alleges that the National Science Foundation's new grant-funding priorities as well as a cap on what's known as indirect research expenses \u201cviolate the law and jeopardize America\u2019s longstanding global leadership in STEM.\u201d",
      "Another district court had already blocked the the cap on indirect costs \u2014 administrative expenses that allow research to get done like paying support staff and maintaining equipment. This injunction had been requested to restore funding to the grants that were cut.",
      "In April, the NSF announced a new set of priorities and began axing hundreds of grants for research focused on things like misinformation and diversity, equity and inclusion. Researchers who lost funding also were studying artificial intelligence, post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans, STEM education for K-12 students and more.",
      "Researchers were not given a specific explanation for why their grants were canceled, attorney Colleen Faherty, representing the state of New York, said during last month's hearing. Instead, they received boilerplate language stating that their work \u201cno longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.\"",
      "NSF has long been directed by Congress to encourage underrepresented groups like women and people with disabilities to participate in STEM. According to the lawsuit, the science foundation's funding cuts already halted efforts to train the next generation of scientists in fields like computer science, math and environmental science.",

      "The plaintiff states are trying to \u201csubstitute their own judgement for the judgement of the agency,\" Adam Gitlin, an attorney for the NSF, said during the hearing.",

Per the lawsuit filed in May, for example, the University of Northern Colorado lost funding for only one of its nine programs focused on increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.",

      "PHILADELPHIA, Miss. -- Each summer, hundreds of brightly colored cabins come to life with the sound of children playing and smells of Southern comfort food in what's known as Mississippi's \u201cgiant house party,\u201d the Neshoba County Fair.",
      "The fair touts itself as the largest campground fair in the country, where attendees cram into more than 500 two-and-three story wood cabins for eight days every year. The larger cabins can sleep upwards of 30 people, sometimes in the same room.",
      "\u201cIt's like having two Christmases a year,\u201d said Mike Hardy, who attends the fair just about every year and shared a cabin this year with 20 members of his family, from infants to grandparents.",
      "For Hardy, who lives more than 300 miles (500 kilometers) away in Nashville, Tennessee, the fair is one of the only times he visits his hometown. He calls it a high school, college and family reunion all wrapped into one.",
      "\u201cI wouldn't miss it for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just always been a big part of our lives.\u201d",
      "Hardy inherited the cabin from his father, who bought it in the late 1960s. It's located in what's known as \u2018watermelon alley,' one of several neighborhoods that divide up the community, which feels like a mix between a candy-colored frontier town and an amusement park. His children grew up going there. The pictures they drew on hot summer days still hang on the walls, joined now by their own children's artwork.",
      "His daughter, Madison Hardy-Dennis, attended her first fair when she was less than a year old. Now, her 6-year-old twins run barefoot in the red Mississippi mud, play pranks and get into water balloon fights \u2014 just like she did.",
      "\u201cI hope that they understand how special this week is, and that this place is,\u201d Hardy-Dennis said.",
      "Horse-race watching at the nearby race track and card playing are among Hardy family's favorite activities during the fair. They take their kids to the carnival rides and cook large family meals. On their way to the track, they walk through Founders Square, the oldest section of cabins with a pavilion used for dances and political speeches. It's where Ronald Reagan gave his famous states' rights speech in 1980 while running for president.",

      "Sid Salter, whose family has been going to the fair since it first opened in 1889, said it's a place where children are safe to roam freely. Often, parents write their kid's name and cabin number on their arms. If they get lost, a friendly fair-goer will help them find their way back.",
      "The communal atmosphere extends to mealtime. Although only about 20 people stay in their cabin, Salter's family often feeds 50 or 60 people a day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an inexpensive hobby,\u201d he joked, \u201cbut it\u2019s a great time with people you only see, you know, during the fair.\"",
      "The fair, Salter said, also feels like a reunion with loved ones who are no longer living. He imagines that the spirits of his twin sister, first wife and parents like to \u201cknock around\u201d the campground where they made so many memories.",
      "\u201cIt may be a figment of a fertile imagination \u2014 I\u2019m sure it is \u2014 but I feel it,\u201d he said.",
      "At 66 years old, Salter has only missed three Neshoba County Fairs, once for an adventure camp when he was 13, again to cover the 2000 Republican National Convention as a reporter and in 2017 when he was battling cancer. He said he often eats the same meals, does the same activities and sees the same people year after year.",
      "\u201cIn a sea of change in every facet of our lives, the fair is constant,\" he said.",

      "Air quality alerts were in effect in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, as well as eastern Nebraska and parts of Indiana and Illinois.

      "WASHINGTON -- A stalemate over the pace of confirmations has delayed the Senate\u2019s yearly August recess, for now, as President Donald Trump declares that his nominees \u201cshould NOT BE FORCED TO WAIT\u201d and as Democrats slow the process by forcing procedural votes on almost all of Trump\u2019s picks.",
      "Caught in the middle, Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he will keep the Senate in session over the weekend, at least, to hold confirmation votes while also negotiating with Democrats to speed up consideration of dozens of nominees. The two sides haven\u2019t come to agreement yet, and it\u2019s still unclear if Trump, who has been publicly calling on Republicans to cancel their break, would be onboard with any bipartisan deal.",
      "Thune said Friday he was leaving some of the negotiations to Trump and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how this is going to get resolved,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where that leads.\u201d",
      "Senators in both parties are eager to leave Washington for their annual break, when many of them tour their states to talk to constituents. Republicans in particular are eager to return home and sell the massive tax and spending cuts package they passed in July as Democrats vow to use it against them in the 2026 midterm elections. The House, which has no role in the confirmation process, fled Washington a week ago.",
      "But Trump has other plans.",
      "\u201cThe Senate must stay in Session, taking no recess, until the entire Executive Calendar is CLEAR!!!\u201d Trump posted on social media Thursday night, after a meeting with Thune at the White House. \u201cWe have to save our Country from the Lunatic Left. Republicans, for the health and safety of the USA, DO YOUR JOB, and confirm All Nominees.\u201d",
      "Thune said this week that Republicans are considering changing the Senate's rules when they get back in September to make it easier to quickly approve a president\u2019s nominations \u2014 and to try and avoid a similar stalemate in the future. Democrats have blocked more nominees than usual this year, denying any quick unanimous consent votes and forcing roll calls on each one, a lengthy process that takes several days per nominee and allows for debate time.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said Friday that Senate GOP leadership was \u201cgoing back, drafting a specific rule for us to react to\" as they try to plot a path forward.",
      "It\u2019s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn\u2019t allowed at least some quick confirmations. Thune has already kept the Senate in session for more days, and with longer hours, this year to try and confirm as many of Trump\u2019s nominees as possible.",
      "Democrats have little desire to give in, even though they too are eager to skip town after several long months of work and bitter partisan fights over legislation. Schumer has said Democrats have blocked quick votes because, \u201chistorically bad nominees deserved historic levels of scrutiny.\u201d",

Both parties have increasingly used stalling tactics to delay confirmations that were once quick, bipartisan and routine. In 2013, Democrats changed Senate rules for lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations as Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial nominations. In 2017, Republicans did the same for Supreme Court nominees as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.",

      "In his first year as leader, Thune has worked with Trump to quickly confirm his Cabinet and navigated complicated internal party dynamics to pass the tax and spending cuts package, which Trump sees as his signature policy achievement.",
      "Yet the president is applying increasing pressure on Thune and his conference, trying to control the Senate's schedule and calling out three Republican senators in social media posts this week \u2014 including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the senior-most Senate Republican who worked closely with Trump to confirm his picks for Supreme Court in his first term.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have drawn expressions of relief from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April",
      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries drew expressions of relief Friday from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others expressed disappointment or frustration over running out of time after hitting Trump's Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America\u2019s trading partners.",
      "The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7, but uncertainty over what Trump might do next remains. The way ahead for China, which runs the largest trade surplus with the U.S., is unclear after talks earlier this week in Stockholm produced no deal. Trump has yet to say if he'll extend an Aug. 12 pause on painfully high import duties on Chinese products.",
      "The reaction from financial markets was muted. Benchmarks fell in Asia, with South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping nearly 4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at more than 150 yen per dollar.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government was disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.",
      "Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.",
      "\u201cCanada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\u201d Carney said in a statement.",
      "Many of Canada's exports to the U.S. are covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and face no tariff. But steel, lumber, aluminum and autos have been subject to still higher tariffs.",
      "Switzerland was reeling after Trump ordered a 39% tariff rate for the land of luxury watches, pharmaceuticals and financial services. That was up from his original proposal of a 31% duty.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Council notes with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland\u2019s very constructive stance from the outset, the U.S. intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland,\u201d the government said in a post on X. It said it would continue to seek a negotiated solution.",
      "New Zealand officials said Friday they would keep lobbying Trump to cut the 15% tariff he announced for their country\u2019s exports to the U.S., up from the original 10% baseline set in April.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a good thing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Trade Minister Todd McClay told Radio New Zealand. The exporter of meat, dairy, wine and farm machinery ran a $1.1 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, according to U.S. Trade Representative data.",
      "McClay said New Zealand exporters had reported they could absorb a 10% tariff or pass it on to U.S. consumers through increased costs. A further increase would \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said.",
      "Neither New Zealand nor its neighbor Australia have struck tariff deals with the Trump administration. Australian steel and aluminum exports have faced a steep 50% tariff since June.",
      "Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the 10% overall tariff on Australia\u2019s exports to the United States was a vindication of his government\u2019s \u201ccool and calm negotiations.\u201d But he said even that level was not justified. The U.S. exports twice as much to Australia as it imports from its bilateral free trade partner, and Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. exports.",
      "Objecting to a 15% tariff rate, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re told the newspaper VG the Scandinavian country should have \u201czero tariffs.\" He said talks were continuing.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- In the final moments of a life defined by violence, 60-year-old Edward Zakrzewski thanked the people of Florida for killing him \"in the most cold, calculated, clean, humane, efficient way possible,\" breathing deeply as a lethal drug cocktail coursed through his veins.",
      "With his last breath, strapped to a gurney inside a state prison's death chamber, Zakrzewski paid what Florida had deemed was his debt to society and became the 27th person put to death in the U.S. so far this year, the highest number in a decade.",
      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has executed nine people in 2025, more than than any other state, and set a new state record, with DeSantis overseeing more executions in a single year than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.",
      "Across the country, more people have been put to death in the first seven months of this year than in all of 2024. Florida's increase is helping put the U.S. on track to surpass 2015\u2019s total of 28 executions.",
      "And the number of executions is expected to keep climbing. Nine more people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025.",
      "After the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in the \u201970s, executions steadily increased, peaking in 1999 at 98 deaths. Since then, they had been dropping \u2014 in part due to legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs, and declining public support for capital punishment, which has prompted a majority of states to either pause or abolish it altogether.",
      "The ratcheting up after this yearslong decline comes as Republican President Donald Trump has urged prosecutors to aggressively seek the death penalty and as some GOP-controlled state legislatures have pushed to expand the category of crimes punishable by death and the methods used to carry out executions.",
      "John Blume, director of the Cornell Death Penalty Project, says the uptick in executions doesn\u2019t appear to be linked to a change in public support for the death penalty or an increase in the rate of death sentences, but is rather a function of the discretion of state governors.",
      "\u201cThe most cynical view would be: It seems to matter to the president, so it matters to them,\u201d Blume said of the governors.",
      "In response to questions from The Associated Press, a spokesperson for DeSantis pointed to statements the governor made at a press conference in May, saying he takes capital cases \u201cvery seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are some crimes that are just so horrific, the only appropriate punishment is the death penalty,\u201d DeSantis said, adding: \u201cthese are the worst of the worst.\u201d",
      "Julie Andrew expressed relief after witnessing the April execution of the man who killed her sister in the Florida Keys in 2000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart felt lighter and I can breathe again.\u201d",
      "The governor\u2019s office did not respond to questions about why the governor is increasing the pace of executions now and whether Trump\u2019s policies are playing a role.",
      "Little is publicly known about how the governor decides whose death warrant to sign and when, a process critics have called \u201csecretive\u201d and \u201carbitrary.\u201d",
      "According to the Florida Department of Corrections, there are 266 people currently on death row, including two men in their 80s, both of whom have been awaiting their court-ordered fate for more than 40 years.",

      "\u201cAny time we go forward, I\u2019m convinced that not only was the verdict correct, but that this punishment is absolutely appropriate under the circumstances,\u201d DeSantis said.",
      "For years, the U.S. has ranked alongside Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt as among the countries carrying out the highest number of confirmed executions. China is thought to execute more of its citizens than any other nation, although the exact totals are considered a state secret, according to the non-profit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Robin Maher, the center's executive director, says elected officials in the U.S. have long used the death penalty as a \u201cpolitical tool,\u201d adding it\u2019s \u201ca way of embellishing their own tough-on-crime credentials.\u201d",
      "In 2024, DeSantis signed one death warrant. From 2020-2022, Florida didn\u2019t carry out a single execution. In 2023, DeSantis oversaw six \u2014 the highest number during his time in office until this year. 2023 was also the year the governor challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.",
      "There are a number of reasons why the rate of executions may vary from one administration to the next, said Mark Schlakman, an attorney and Florida State University professor who advised then-governor Lawton Chiles on the death penalty.",
      "The availability of staff resources, the tempo of lengthy legal appeals, and court challenges against the death penalty itself can all play a role, Schlakman said, as well as a governor\u2019s \u201csensibilities.\u201d",
      "One execution after another, opponents of the death penalty hold vigils in the Florida capitol, outside the governor's mansion, and near the state prison that houses the death chamber, as people of faith across the state pray for mercy, healing and justice.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Democrats still in the dumps over last year's elections have found cause for optimism in North Carolina, where former Gov. Roy Cooper jumped into the race for that state's newly open seat with a vow to address voters' persistent concerns about the challenges of making ends meet.",
      "Even Republicans quietly note that Cooper\u2019s candidacy makes their job of holding the seat more difficult and expensive. Cooper had raised $2.6 million for his campaign between his Monday launch and Tuesday, and more than $900,000 toward allied groups.",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, are hardly ceding the economic populist ground. In announcing his candidacy for the Senate on Thursday, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley credited President Donald Trump with fulfilling campaign promises to working Americans and painted Cooper as a puppet of the left.",
      "Still, Cooper\u2019s opening message that he hears the worries of working families has given Democrats in North Carolina and beyond a sense that they can reclaim their place as the party that champions the middle class. They think it's a message that could help them pick up a Senate seat, and possibly more, in next year's midterm elections, which in recent years have typically favored the party out of power.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Roy Cooper. And I know that today, for too many Americans, the middle class feels like a distant dream,\u201d the former governor said in a video announcing his candidacy. \u201cMeanwhile, the biggest corporations and the richest Americans have grabbed unimaginable wealth at your expense. It\u2019s time for that to change.\u201d",
      "Cooper's plainspoken appeal may represent just the latest effort by Democrats to find their way back to power, but it has some thinking they've finally found their footing after last year's resounding losses.",
      "\u201cI think it would do us all a lot of good to take a close look at his example,\u201d said Larry Grisolano, a Chicago-based Democratic media strategist and former adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Whatley, a former North Carolina GOP chairman and close Trump ally, used his Thursday announcement that he was entering the race to hail the president as the true champion of the middle class. He said Trump had already fulfilled promises to end taxes on tips and overtime and said Cooper was out of step with North Carolinians.",
      "\u201cSix months in, it's pretty clear to see, America is back,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cA healthy, robust economy, safe kids and communities and a strong America. These are the North Carolina values that I will champion if elected.\u201d",
      "Still, the decision by Cooper, who held statewide office for 24 years and has never lost an election, makes North Carolina a potential bright spot in a midterm election cycle when Democrats must net four seats to retake the majority \u2014 and when most of the 2026 Senate contests are in states Trump won comfortably last November.",
      "State Rep. Cynthia Ball threw up a hand in excitement when asked Monday at the North Carolina Legislative Building about Cooper\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cEveryone I\u2019ve spoken to was really hoping that he was going to run,\u201d said the Raleigh Democrat.",
      "Democratic legislators hope having Cooper\u2019s name at the top of the ballot will encourage higher turnout and help them in downballot races. While Republicans have controlled both General Assembly chambers since 2011, Democrats managed last fall to end the GOP\u2019s veto-proof majority, if only by a single seat.",
      "Republican strategists familiar with the national Senate landscape have said privately that Cooper poses a formidable threat.",
      "The Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC affiliated with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, wasted no time in challenging Cooper's portrayal of a common-sense advocate for working people.",
      "\u201cRoy Cooper masquerades as a moderate,\u201d the narrator in the 30-second spot says. \u201cBut he's just another radical, D.C. liberal in disguise.\u201d",

      "Whatley accused Cooper of failing to address illegal immigration and of supporting liberal gender ideology. He echoed the themes raised in the Senate Leadership Fund ad, which noted Cooper's vetoes in the Republican-led legislature of measures popular with conservatives, such as banning gender-affirming health care for minors and requiring county sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration officials.",

      "A California judge is extending migrant status protections ended by the Trump administration for more than 60,000 people from Central America and Nepal",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration's plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.",
      "Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It's part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them.",
      "The secretary said the two countries had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in recovering from 1998's Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.",

      "U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.",
      "In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an \u201cobjective review of the country conditions\u201d such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.",
      "If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy.",
      "\u201cThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,\u201d Thompson said.",

      "Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the \"discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.\u201d",

      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:38:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "story": [
      "Former Food Network star Paula Deen announced Friday the abrupt closure of the Savannah restaurant that launched her to fame with its menu of fried chicken, banana pudding and other indulgent Southern dishes.",
      "Deen ran The Lady & Sons restaurant with her two sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen, for nearly three decades. Loyal fans visiting Savannah continued to line up for Deen's buffet long after the Food Network canceled her show, \"Paula's Home Cooking,\" in 2013.",
      "But 78-year-old Deen said Friday that The Lady & Sons closed for good along with her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. A statement posted on Deen's website and social media accounts didn't say why the restaurants had shut down.",
      "\"Hey, y'all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,\" Deen's statement said.",
      "\"Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,\" she said. \"We have endless love and gratitude for every customer who has walked through our doors.\"",
      "Deen said her four restaurants outside Savannah will remain open. They're located in Nashville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Branson, Missouri.",
      "Deen said Friday she and her sons will visit the Branson establishment on Aug. 8, and said the family is \"excited to continue visiting these restaurants regularly.\"",
      "\"Savannah will always be our home, and we'll always be here to support our wonderful community,\" she said in the statement.",
      "Hey, y\u2019all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady...",
      "Windows at The Lady & Sons were covered with brown paper on Friday. Signs posted at the front entrance read: \"It is with heavy hearts and tremendous gratitude that we announce that we have retired and closed.\"",
      "Martin Rowe works in a downtown office across the street from Deen's restaurant. He said business seemed to be going strong up until it closed.",
      "\"Nobody knew anything was wrong,\" Rowe said. \"I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.\"",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",
      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",
      "Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted \"Paula's Home Cooking\" in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.",
      "The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public, which included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.",
      "Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, \"Yes, of course,\" though she added: \"It's been a very long time.\"",
      "Deen returned to television on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars,\" on chef Gordon Ramsay's Fox show \"MasterChef: Legends,\" and on Fox Nation, which began streaming \"At Home With Paula Deen\" in 2020. She also posts cooking videos to a YouTube channel that has more than 520,000 subscribers.",

      "\"Amy Bradley is Missing,\" directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, explores the unsolved case that has puzzled investigators for nearly three decades. Bradley disappeared from her family's cruise, leaving behind numerous theories but few concrete answers.",
      "\"The Amy Bradley story is something if you've been around the genre, you know about it,\" Mark said. \"It's one of the most baffling mysteries of a disappearance case.\"",
      "The case presents multiple scenarios for what may have happened to Bradley. The film floats several theories: she could have accidentally fallen overboard, committed suicide or been the victim of foul play. Investigators have noted that the sliding door to her balcony was found ajar, raising questions about whether she left voluntarily or was taken against her will.",
      "Mark and Lott said they were drawn to the story after learning that existing coverage barely scratched the surface of the case. After meeting with Bradley's parents, Ron and Iva Bradley, in Virginia, the directors realized the family deserved justice.",

    "story": [
      "A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers, made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \"baby parade.\"",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump's administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don't have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies' lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician, associate dean for public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breastfeeding supplies and baby clothes, but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \"baby bonuses,\" a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that it doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",

    "story": [
      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",
      "As for the economic impact that tariffs will have on the economy, Moynihan said \"no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.\"",

    "summary": "Nik and Adinah Johnson, who retired in their forties, are part of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), a movement that looks at work as a means to an end, and where frugality buys freedom from the rat race.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent Sunday morning, at a Bible camp outside of Gainesville, Florida, Nik Johnson got up to preach, not about hellfire and brimstone, but about a very different fire: Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE). \"Ultimately at the end of the day, financial independence really ain't about us,\" he said. \"It's about people that we love and the causes that we care about.\"",
      "This was Camp FI. Its attendees: retirees and aspiring retirees who looked a little on the young side.",
      "When Johnson met his wife, Adinah, some 30 years ago, she knew right away, he was a saver: \"Our first date, he had a coupon,\" she said.",
      "\"I did use a coupon! And I'm not ashamed about it,\" said Nik. \"I knew that if I presented a coupon and she had an issue with it, she was not my soulmate.\"",
      "Adinah's reaction? \"How many other coupons do you have? What's the best deal? Wait a minute, let's see what we could do here!\"",
      "Nik worked in software, while Adinah was in higher ed. And despite modest starting salaries, they managed to pay off their home and save $1.6 million by consuming less, saving more, and putting 300,000 miles on their beloved minivan, Big Red.",
      "Nik said, \"I shared this with Adinah: I always wanted to be to the point that when I got to 50 I didn't want to have to work. And so honestly, I didn't exactly know how to achieve that.\"",
      "Then, one day during the pandemic, Nik was poking around on the Internet and discovered the FIRE Movement, which led him to Camp FI \u2013 a group of hardcore savers and careful spenders who share tips, tricks and philosophical discourse with basically one goal \u2026 to get out of the rat race.",
      "It's all inspired by Peter Adeney, who blogs under the name Mr. Money Mustache. \"American life is so inefficient,\" he said. \"We're all just kind of following each other, what each other does, and not realizing where all of this time and money is slipping through our hands. So, start doing things that are different from what other people do, would probably be the first piece of advice.\"",
      "Adeney retired at age 30, and turned 50 this year. He said, \"I often think that, because I retired so early, I have lived a lot longer than a normal 50-year-old. Like, I feel like I retired 100 years ago, because I've had so many experiences. It's a great antidote to the usual thing, where people say, 'Life goes by too fast. Then, you miss it.'",
      "\"However, it doesn't solve your happiness problems,\" Adeney said. \"One of my friends who's also a blogger says, like, he still had to confront some demons and some emotional issues. And taking away his job just exposed them more, 'cause he could no longer distract himself from them.\"",
      "The key to saving for retirement, according to Adeney, is to figure out what's important to you \u2013 and trim your spending everywhere else.",
      "Vicki Robin is a sort of mythical figure in the FIRE Movement. She is the co-author (with Joe Dominguez) of the 1992 personal finance book, \"Your Money or Your Life.\" She said, \"As you start to elaborate what's important to you, you realize, like, 'I'm gonna minimize the amount of money I spend, 'cause that's my life energy.' And there's some formula that arises in your mind of, like, 'The less I spend, the more life I have.'\"",
      "Robin's philosophy is less about early retirement and more about asking what is \"enough,\" which differs for everyone. But the consensus of the FIRE Movement is that, to retire, you have to save and invest 25 times your yearly expenses, and then live off of a 4% drawdown each year.",
      "Robin said, \"It's just, 'Okay, how can I have enough for a life that's really happy, but no excess, so that I can liberate my time to do what I find I'm called to do, what I care to do?' And, you know, that evolves over time. I have a little phrase that I've said: I buy my freedom with my frugality every day.\"",
      "A frugality which Nik and Adina Johnson say they are now reaping the rewards of, along with their three children: a life less defined by the \"stuff\" they possess, and more by the freedom they enjoy.",
      "Nik said, \"They're gonna always remember this trip to Disney. But they're not gonna remember, you know, that extra pair of tennis shoes I bought my son. My son's not gonna look at me like, 'Hey Dad, remember that blazer you had on? Man, it was awesome!'\"",
      "Asked what these early retirees' day looks like, Adinah replied, \"Well, I have to pick up the kids, and then I have to take my son to football practice. And then whatever grocery shopping I may have needed to do while I was doing this interview, I need to go ahead and get some of that grocery shopping done.\"",
      "\"Doesn't sound like she needs my help for any of that; I'll probably go play golf,\" Nik laughed.",
      "I observed, \"Seems like one of you is more retired than the other one.\"",

The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",
      "The July data appears to back up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's\u00a0most recent \"beige book,\" which compiles comments from local businesses, that many companies were delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant job report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "Berkshire Hathaway's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett's\u00a0company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in\u00a0Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it must record the current value of its massive investment portfolio, even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprised shareholders by\u00a0selling off\u00a0a huge chunk of its Apple stake, which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it has had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft's core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",
      "Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to\u00a0give up the CEO title\u00a0at the end of the year and hand over operations to\u00a0Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman.",
      "Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement.",
      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after\u00a0rival Union Pacific announced\u00a0a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with Eastern Rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\"He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\" Seifert said. \"I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn't been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there's a logical case to be made they'll accept it.\"",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",
      "Instead, Greer argued that the numbers reflect conditions prior to the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed through Congress last month. He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order hiking tariffs on U.S. imports could drive up consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for millions of businesses, trade experts said.",
      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",
      "\"For the average shopper, the effects don't always show up as a big price hike on the shelf. Instead, it's subtler \u2014 fewer options, smaller quantities and less generous promotions,\" he said. \"Companies are quietly reducing [their stockpiles], reworking product specs or stripping out expensive components to hit margin targets.\"",

      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cuts in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners are weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",

In June, the House\u00a0approved a White House request\u00a0to claw back $1.1 billion in already appointed federal funds from the CPB. The Senate Appropriations Committee's 2026 appropriations bill eliminated funding for the CPB for the first time in over 50 years.",

      "Former Food Network star Paula Deen announced Friday the abrupt closure of the Savannah restaurant that launched her to fame with its menu of fried chicken, banana pudding and other indulgent Southern dishes.",
      "Deen ran The Lady & Sons restaurant with her two sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen, for nearly three decades. Loyal fans visiting Savannah continued to line up for Deen's buffet long after the Food Network canceled her show, \"Paula's Home Cooking,\" in 2013.",
      "But 78-year-old Deen said Friday that The Lady & Sons closed for good along with her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. A statement posted on Deen's website and social media accounts didn't say why the restaurants had shut down.",
      "\"Hey, y'all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,\" Deen's statement said.",
      "\"Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,\" she said. \"We have endless love and gratitude for every customer who has walked through our doors.\"",
      "Deen said her four restaurants outside Savannah will remain open. They're located in Nashville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Branson, Missouri.",
      "Deen said Friday she and her sons will visit the Branson establishment on Aug. 8, and said the family is \"excited to continue visiting these restaurants regularly.\"",
      "\"Savannah will always be our home, and we'll always be here to support our wonderful community,\" she said in the statement.",
      "Hey, y\u2019all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady...",
      "Windows at The Lady & Sons were covered with brown paper on Friday. Signs posted at the front entrance read: \"It is with heavy hearts and tremendous gratitude that we announce that we have retired and closed.\"",
      "Martin Rowe works in a downtown office across the street from Deen's restaurant. He said business seemed to be going strong up until it closed.",
      "\"Nobody knew anything was wrong,\" Rowe said. \"I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.\"",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",
      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",
      "Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted \"Paula's Home Cooking\" in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.",
      "The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public, which included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.",
      "Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, \"Yes, of course,\" though she added: \"It's been a very long time.\"",
      "Deen returned to television on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars,\" on chef Gordon Ramsay's Fox show \"MasterChef: Legends,\" and on Fox Nation, which began streaming \"At Home With Paula Deen\" in 2020.

      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "In July alone, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",
      "\"We are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by DOGE impact non-profits and health care in addition to the government,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "Layoffs are also accelerating in the vast retail sector as tariffs raise the cost of doing business, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have announced more than 80,000 cuts through July, up nearly 250% compared to the same period last year, the firm found.",
      "\"Retailers are being impacted by tariffs, inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty causing layoffs and store closures. Further declines in consumer spending could trigger additional losses,\" the group said.",

    "summary": "Millions of borrowers in forbearance through the SAVE plan will see interest start accruing on Friday. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who had signed up for a Biden-era repayment plan will start seeing interest accrue to their accounts starting today, Aug. 1, a change that could result in an additional $300 in monthly costs for the typical borrower, according to one analysis.",
      "The Department of Education announced on July 9 that it planned to restart charging interest for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created by the Biden administration in 2023 to help lighten the financial burden faced by millions of student loan borrowers.",
      "But two courts last year issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively halting the repayment program. In response, the Biden administration moved all of the SAVE plan's enrollees into zero-interest forbearance, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "The Education Department says resuming interest on the loans represents a measure of \"fiscal responsibility,\" according to its July 9 statement. But the monetary impact on the roughly 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan could be significant, given that a typical borrower could see an increase of $300 per month due to new interest charges, according to a calculation by the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with higher-education debt.",
      "SAVE enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance, which means they won't need to make monthly payments, but \"the most significant impact is that your total loan balance will start growing again\" because interest will resume, Bethany Hubert, a financial aid specialist at lender Earnest, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"If you choose not to make payments, the accruing interest can really balloon your balance, making it much more challenging and expensive to pay back over time.\"",
      "How much will my payment increase?",
      "While the typical borrower could see costs increase by about $300 per month, or $3,500 per year, the specific increase will depend on your loan balance.",
      "Borrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the\u00a0loan simulator\u00a0on the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said, although she noted that it might not yet include all the recent changes impacting student loans.",
      "Should I change repayment plans?",
      "Borrowers should evaluate the four repayment plans available, which can be found at here at the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said.",
      "Changing plans will depend on your situation, added Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit that provides free advice for student borrowers.",
      "Borrowers who are seeking loan forgiveness, which can be earned after repaying a loan for anywhere from 10 years to 25 years, depending on the plan, may want switch because \"the SAVE forbearance doesn't count towards the payments needed to get the balance forgiven under those plans,\" she said.",
      "What about the new Repayment Assistance Plan?",
      "There's also a new repayment plan in the works that borrowers could consider, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which is due in 2026 and is part of the \"big beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4.",
      "\"For earners who make less than $10,000, their [monthly] payment will be $10 under RAP,\" Hubert said.",
      "For those with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $10,000 per year, the repayments will be based on 1% to 10% of their income minus $50 in payments each month for each child the borrower has. \"With that in mind, we can estimate that a borrower who has an AGI of $45,000 and no children would have their monthly payment set at $150,\" she added.",
      "RAP payments could carry a higher monthly payment for some borrowers than under the SAVE plan, but the SAVE plan is likely to eventually be eliminated due to the court cases, Mayotte said.",
      "\"At a minimum, I would suggest trying to make payments that cover the monthly interest as it begins to accrue to prevent your balance from growing,\" Hubert added.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday the new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately.",
      "Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, as well.",
      "In announcing the hike in Canadian tariffs, White House said Canada hadn't done enough to \"arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\"",
      "In a statement released early Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\" he said.",
      "Carney added that some industries - including lumber, steel, aluminum and automobiles - are \"heavily impacted by U.S. duties and tariffs. For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversity our export markets.\"",
      "In Beijing, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Friday that, \"China's opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no one's interests.\"",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Global financial markets fell in overnight trading after the White House tariff announcement. In the U.S., stock futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex were each down 0.9%, while Nasdaq Composite futures fell roughly 1%.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:31:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday sharply probed\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as higher duties are set to snap into place Friday for countries that have not yet reached trade deals with the administration.",
      "The 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. A ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "As arguments got underway, several judges on the appeals court peppered Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, about whether IEEPA authorizes the president to impose tariffs.",
      "One judge immediately noted that the law has never before been used to assess the levies on trading partners.",
      "Many other laws regulating trade include the word \"tariff,\" the judge said, \"but here, IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them.\"",
      "Pointing to those trade statutes, which impose constraints on the duties that a president can assess, one of the judges questioned why a president would rely on those laws when IEEPA provides broader power under the Justice Department's interpretation.",
      "\"Your argument dislocates that entire U.S. trade-relief framework,\" he said.",
      "Later, looking at the harmonized tariff schedule, which sets tariff rates and categories for merchandise imported into the U.S., members of the court criticized the scope of Mr. Trump's levies, which cover nearly every country.",
      "\"It's a wholesale revision of the scheme that Congress enacted,\" a judge said, adding, \"it's really kind of asking for an extraordinary change\" to the legislature's approach to the tariff schedule.",
      "Other members of the Federal Circuit seemed concerned with the breadth of authority the president was claiming in relying on IEEPA to impose broad tariffs on trading partners.",
      "\"It seems to me you're asking for unbounded authority,\" one judge told Shumate.",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday for countries the administration has not reached trade agreements with.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy. Shumate argued before the Federal Circuit that courts should not second-guess the president's determination that trade deficits are an emergency, and some of the judges seemed inclined to agree that the consequences of those imbalances would fit within IEEPA's framework.",
      "He also said that the emergency powers law authorizes a president to \"regulate ... any ... importation,\" and that covers the imposition of tariffs.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"That is a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,\" Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the small businesses, told the Federal Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that its more closely watched Consumer Price Index, its primary inflation measure, also ticked higher in June as the cost of heavily imported items such as appliances, furniture and toys increased.",

      "Your glass of French or Italian wine could get pricier as soon as next week, with a new 15% U.S. tariff on European Union imports set to kick in on Aug. 1. The same goes for popular brands of whisky, cognac and other spirits, many of which are made in Europe.",
      "Harry Root, owner of Grassroots Wine, in Charleston, South Carolina, which distributes domestic and imported wines to restaurants and retailers, said the new levies on goods from the 27-country EU will leave him no choice but to raise prices for his clients, which he said are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers.",
      "\"We have to increase prices because when the container of wine I've ordered lands, I have to pay 100% of whatever the tariff is on that wine,\" Root said on Wednesday at a U.S. Wine Trade Alliance (USWTA) roundtable on the impact of the new U.S. tariffs on the EU.",
      "Higher prices for imported wines will also raise the cost of wine produced in the U.S. as consumers shift to domestic labels and drive up demand, according to USWTA President Ben Aneff.",
      "\"Econ 101 will tell you that higher-cost imported products will also mean higher prices for domestic products,\" Aneff said at the roundtable. \"So you'd expect a big drop in demand, higher prices, lower choice for consumers. It's a problem.\"",
      "Max Rohn, CEO of Long Island, New York-based Wolffer Estate winery, put it bluntly.",
      "\"We want people to drink wine, and tariffs will make them drink less wine,\" he said during the USWTA event.",
      "A trade group representing Italian winemakers, Unioni Vini Italiani, is warning that a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. could cost around $15 after the 15% EU tariff kicks in.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment about concerns that higher tariffs on EU and other imports could raise the cost of wine and spirits in the U.S.",
      "Higher costs for a wee dram",
      "A 10% American\u00a0levy on the U.K. under a trade deal announced in May could also push up liquor costs for U.S. consumers. Drew McKenzie Smith, founder and managing director of Fife, Scotland-based Lindores Abbey Distillery, told CBS MoneyWatch that the tariff on shipments to the U.S. could force him to hike the price of a bottle of scotch by an equivalent amount.",
      "\"We had hoped to shoulder that cost because if you put your whisky up too much, then people won't buy it. But to cover that, it means we'd have to add 10% to the price of a bottle, so it's a tricky one,\" he said, noting that a bottle of Abbey Distillery scotch that currently retails for about $86 could rise to about $94.",
      "In 2024, the U.K. exported 132 million bottles of scotch whisky to the U.S., according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research firm that is tracking the effects of tariffs on food and beverage costs in the U.S, said that the wine and spirits business is more exposed to tariffs because consumers are less likely to switch to domestic substitutes.",
      "\"It's a little different when you're assessing the impact on prices related to wine and spirits compared to other goods because consumers have certain tastes and preferences,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Meanwhile, unlike with some industries, which may be able to relocate factories from abroad to the U.S., wine production can't be reshored.",
      "\"You can't produce French wine in the U.S. because then it ceases to be French wine,\" he said. \"If consumers have a strong preference for a particular bottle, they'll continue to buy it.\"",
      "Added Aneff of the USWTA, \"Wines from one place are not fungible for wines from another. It's a different product.\"",
      "Lobbying for relief",
      "Trade groups for both European and domestic wine producers are lobbying for exemptions from the 15% tariffs on most EU goods, citing the potential for substantial losses on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Unione Italiana Vini said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that the 15% tariff would result in a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the finalized deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "The USWTA is also urging U.S. trade officials to include wine in its list of exempted goods under the new U.S.-EU trade deal.",
      "\"We are heartened that negotiations are leaving room for wine to be included under the zero-for-zero exemption structure,\" Aneff said in a statement. \"Now is the time to ensure wine is prioritized in the final agreement.\"",
      "Addressing the EU tariff agreement, Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO Chris Swonger\u00a0said\u00a0the group is also \"optimistic that in the days ahead this positive meeting and agreement will lead to a return to zero-for-zero tariffs for U.S. and EU spirits products.\"",
      "Peril for restaurants",
      "The stepped up U.S. tariffs on the EU wouldn't just hurt consumers \u2014 they could also lead to the loss of thousands of jobs at manufacturers and distributors, according to industry experts. Restaurants, which depend on sales of European wines to buoy them financially, also could feel the impact in the form of slimmer profits.",
      "Typically, if a restaurant pays $15 for a bottle of wine from France or Italy, the two largest exporters to the U.S., it will charge patrons $15 a glass, Aneff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Their margin is five times the cost of the bottle,\" he said. \"And for a restaurant that's not a luxury \u2014 it's an absolute necessity.\"",

      "Trading partners like Indonesia, the Philippines, the EU and Japan have struck trade deals before then \u2014 generally agreeing to tariffs that are lower than the ones threatened by Mr. Trump but higher than the 10% baseline.",
      "Meanwhile, negotiations with China, Canada and Mexico remain ongoing. Higher tariffs on Chinese goods are set to take effect on Aug. 12 unless the two countries strike a deal, though an extension is possible, U.S. officials have said.",
      "All told, the president said this week he expects that most imports to the U.S. will face a baseline tariff of 15% to 20%. By comparison, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports in 2023 was around 2.5%, according to figures from the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research center.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing. But many economists warn tariffs can lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves rattled financial markets.",
      "Consumer prices have been relatively stable so far this year \u2014 though above the Federal Reserve's 2%-per-year target. Some economists say that's partly because companies have taken steps to prevent short-term shocks from tariffs.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 19:31:31 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed is maintaining its benchmark interest rate in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday it's keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook.",
      "The decision to hold rates steady marks a continuation of the Fed's \"wait-and-see\" strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.",
      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "Two voting FOMC members, Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, voted in favor of lowering the central bank's short-term rate \u2014 a rare show of dissent at the Fed, where monetary policy is generally set by consensus. It is the first time since 1993 that two member of the Fed's Board of Governors have voted against the chair, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced pressure in recent months from President Trump to lower rates, with the president arguing that inflation remains relatively tame.",
      "In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said most FOMC members voted in favor of maintaining the current rate because inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target, while also describing the economy as remaining in good shape.",
      "\"The economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back inappropriately,\" he said.",
      "Powell added, \"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" referring to the Fed's dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank cut interest rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "Wall Street had anticipated the Fed's decision, with economists pegging the probability the central bank would hold rates steady at 96%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Why is the Fed holding rates steady?",
      "The Fed's Powell has signaled the Fed remains cautious about lowering rates given the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which he has said could dent economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks the dissents by Bowman and Waller represent a minority opinion on the FOMC, with most of the rate-setting panel's voting members preferring to hold rates steady amid amid concern about inflation.",
      "Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with the Consumer Price Index rising\u00a0in June to an annualized rate of 2.7%. At the same time, the economy remains solid. The economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3% rate between April and June, according to data released Wednesday, with economists saying the rebound in growth from earlier this year supports the Fed's argument for keeping rates steady.",
      "\"This [GDP] report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's stance,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email prior to the Fed's decision. The central bank will \"wait for more consistent signals before considering rate cuts.\"",
      "When could the Fed cut rates?",
      "Economists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its two-day meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to FactSet. The FOMC, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Although the economy has proved resilient despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, some economists expect growth to lag and inflation to accelerate over the next few months. Following the latest Fed statement, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs forecast that the Fed will ease its benchmark rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points by year-end, starting in September.",
      "Asked whether the Fed could cut rates at the September meeting, Powell demurred, saying that the decision will be based on economic data that is released between now and the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 16-17. In the lead-up to that decision, the Fed will assess two monthly job reports from the Department of Labor and two additional months' of CPI data.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff rate on imports from India ahead of his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to strike trade deals with dozens of other countries. American importers such as Walmart are on the hook for paying the tariffs, although many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year to try to avoid hiking prices for inflation-weary customers.",
      "\"We know from surveys that companies have every intention of putting [the tariff costs] through to consumers,\" Powell said. \"A reasonable base case is these are one-time price effects.\"",
      "He added, \"We will make sure this doesn't move from being a one-time price increase to serious inflation.\"",
      "Powell's remarks emphasizing the solid U.S. economy, as well as the risks from tariffs, signaled to some economists that a September rate cut might not be in the cards.",
      "\" For [a September rate cut] to happen, the rest of the FOMC will need to become either less concerned about the inflation outlook or more concerned about the economic and labor market outlook,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North American economist Stephen Brown in a report.",

      "Over recent years the stock market's ups and downs haven't connected that strongly with views of the economy; Americans have often reported that inflation and prices have more impact, and not all Americans own stocks. That said, as the market has pushed to recent highs of late, today Americans who say their finances are impacted by the market are also more likely to say those finances are good. They also give better ratings to the national economy.",

      "People in comparably lower income levels are less positive about the state of the economy and more inclined to be cutting back on optional purchases.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25% on imports from India \u2014 in addition to an unspecified \"penalty\" \u2014 for what he said were its high tariffs and trade barriers, and for its large purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",

The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democratic state legislators fled Texas on Sunday in an attempt to deny a quorum to Republicans hoping to vote on a new congressional map that heavily favors the GOP even more than current districts.",
      "\"For two weeks, while families in the Hill Country mourned the loss of over 130 Texans in catastrophic floods, Democrats fought to make their relief the legislature's top priority. Instead, Governor Abbott and Republican leadership used the tragedy as political cover,\" Texas House Democrats said in a statement Sunday.",
      "\"... Governor Abbott has turned the victims of a tragedy into political hostages in his submission to Donald Trump. We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander. As of today, this corrupt special session is over,\" the statement said.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, \"For too long, Donald Trump and Republicans have tried to get away with rigging the system, breaking the rules, and scheming to hold onto power. It's time to fight back.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday night said the lawmakers had until 3 p.m. Monday, when the Texas House is set to reconvene, to return.",
      "\"For any member who fails to do so, I will invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House,\" Abbott said in a statement.",
      "\"The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation\u2014not to prevent votes that may not go their way,\" Abbott wrote. \"Every session, legislators\u00a0on both sides of the aisle\u00a0find themselves on the losing side of a legislative vote. And every session, most of those legislators find a way to disagree agreeably and behave like adults, rather than going AWOL.\"",
      "Republicans unveiled the new maps\u00a0last week as part of a mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to protect the GOP's razor-thin U.S. House majority. President Trump said in July that he believes Republicans could win five more seats in Texas with different districts.",
      "Abbott included redistricting to be addressed in a special legislative session, along with other high-profile topics like approving disaster relief for the deadly Texas floods and a THC ban.",
      "\"For weeks, we've been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown \u2014 if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown \u2014 then we'd give them that showdown,\" Martin said.",
      "Both houses of the Texas legislature are controlled by Republicans, but if most Democratic lawmakers leave the state, they could deny the state House and Senate the two-thirds quorum that they need to vote on the new congressional maps.",
      "At least 51 Texas Democrats have fled the state for Chicago. Politico was first to report the lawmakers had left the state.",
      "\"We're not here to have fun. We're not here because this is easy, and we did make a decision to come here today \u2014 we did not make a decision lightly,\" Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu said after arriving in Illinois. \"But we come here today with absolute moral clarity that this is absolutely the right thing to do to protect the people of the state of Texas.\"",
      "Republicans in Texas currently hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats. The party hopes the new maps could bring that number up to 30, and all of those new 30 seats were won by Mr. Trump in November by at least 10 points.",
      "The five seats come from redrawing Rio Grande Valley districts \u2014 where Mr. Trump has made gains in what were once Democratic strongholds \u2014 and combining Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Greg Cesar's districts in Austin. In North Texas, Rep. Julie Johnson's suburban 32nd District would be reshaped to stretch from the Dallas area to rural Republican strongholds, and Rep. Marc Veasey would be moved out of Tarrant County entirely, which would leave only a small portion of the county represented by a Democrat. All four Houston-area seats were redrawn, with Rep. Al Green's being the most dramatic.",
      "\"They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 election,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico said in a message\u00a0posted to social media. \"If this power grab succeeds, they will hang on to power without any accountability from the voters.\"",
      "Wu said Texas Republicans are \"using is a racist, gerrymandered map, a map that seeks to use racial lines to divide hard working communities who have spent decades building up their power and strengthening their voices, and Governor Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump.\"",
      "Democrats have fought back against the new districts, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries traveling to Austin on Thursday to pledge national support.",
      "\"We are not fighting for the Democratic Party, we are fighting for the democratic process, and the stakes could not be higher. We have to take a stand,\" Talarico added.",
      "Martin said in an appearance Sunday on MSNBC, \"I'm proud of the Texas Dems for actually breaking quorum here. Our democracy is literally under assault by Donald Trump, Greg Abbott and the Republicans, who know that they are on a track to lose the House majority next year. So what do they do? They cheat. They rigged the system. That's all they have left.\"",
      "\"We're certainly going to be standing with folks who will be litigating this in the courts,\" Martin added. \"We will continue to organize on the ground in Texas, and we will continue to support the House Dems, as they have broke quorum right now.\"",
      "This is not the first time Democrats have left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 and not the first time they have done it to protest redistricting. During the landmark 2005 mid-decade redistricting, Texas Democrats fled during two separate special sessions to stop the redistricting. But the redistricting eventually did go through. And in 2023, Republicans passed legislation that levies a $500-a-day fine on lawmakers who leave the state.",
      "The last significant quorum break in the Texas House was in 2021, when Democrats fled the state to prevent a restrictive voting bill from passing.",
      "Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton threatened to assist police in \"hunting down and compelling the attendance\" of any Democratic lawmakers who leave the state to block votes during the special session.",
      "\"If Democrats ignore their duty to their constituents by breaking quorum, they should be found and arrested no matter where they go,\" said Paxton, who is also running for the GOP nomination in next year's Senate race.",
      "Abbott on Sunday said that \"Any Democrat who 'solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept'\" donations to help cover any fines they may be subjected to under Hous rules for skipping votes, \"may have violated bribery laws.\"",

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was negotiating with GOP leadership for $5 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $1 billion for the Global Fund, $300 million for the World Food Program, $50 million to fight HIV in developing countries, about $140 million for the United Nations Children's Fund, and other money funding that had been previously approved, sources said.",
      "After much back and forth, senators believed they had an agreement to get about 20 nominations through before Mr. Trump on Saturday nixed the deal, several sources said.",
      "Some of the negotiations were about Republicans not withholding funds Congress has already agreed to. Schumer wanted no clawbacks, including so-called pocket rescissions, two of the sources said, referring to presidential funding cut proposals to Congress that are very late in the fiscal year.",
      "As of now, about 140 Trump nominees await a vote, including some 30 ambassadors. Among those are Mike Waltz, who is awaiting a confirmation vote as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, nominated for U.S. ambassador to Greece.",
      "Those who were confirmed Saturday include Defense Department officials Earl Matthews and Adam Telle; trade official Will Kimmitt; judicial officials Jeanine Pirro and Jason Quinones; and ambassadors Andrew Puzder for the European Union and Brian Burch for the Vatican. Also confirmed was Senate Majority Leader John Thune's son-in-law, Luke Lindberg, for an undersecretary post at the Agriculture Department.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday praised Thune and Republican senators in a Truth Social post, and criticized Democrats for \"doing everything possible to DELAY these wonderful and talented people from being approved.\"",
      "The remaining administration officials Mr. Trump was hoping to get installed will have to wait until at least September. Thune said the Senate will adjourn until Sept. 2.",
      "\"We were serious about trying to make some progress,\" Schumer told reporters at a news conference Saturday. \"But ultimately, Trump wouldn't agree. He took his ball, he went home \u2014 leaving Democrats and Republicans alike wondering, \"What the hell happened?\"",
      "Pressed on whether he had asked the White House to unfreeze some aid for Palestinians, Schumer said: \"I'm not going to get into the details. Obviously, we'd all like to help Gaza, but the bottom line is, we were getting close on a whole lot of issues, and Donald Trump just pulled the rug out from under people. And even before that, when it looked like we were getting close, a day before, he again called in and screwed it all up.\"",
      "Mr. Trump got his response in even before Schumer began his press conference, posting a message to the senator on Truth Social that read: \"GO TO HELL!\"",
      "\"Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country. This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",
      "As for the economic impact that tariffs will have on the economy, Moynihan said \"no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said Sunday that applications for a fund for rural hospitals will go out in \"early September\" in the wake of Medicaid cuts in President Trump's signature piece of legislation passed by Congress last month.",
      "\"We're putting $50 billion. The president wants this, the Congress wants this,\" Oz said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" into law last month, which included a number of his second-term priorities from tax cuts to increased spending on border security, defense and energy production. The legislation was paid for in part by significant cuts to health care programs, like Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans.",
      "Among the cuts to Medicaid, the new law will lower provider taxes, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs. Lawmakers sought to supplement the cuts with a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals.",
      "Oz said the applications for the fund will start going out in early September. He said the money is designed to help with \"workforce development, right-sizing the system and using technology to provide things like telehealth that can change the world.\"",
      "\"Imagine if we can change the way we think about the delivery of health and make it more about getting people healthy who can thrive and flourish and be fully present in their own lives and as Americans,\" Oz said.",
      "The new law will also make changes to Medicaid work requirements for some able-bodied adults, along with more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would result in 10 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "Oz touted the work requirements, saying \"every Democratic president and Republican president has said that the foundation of a healthy welfare system, a social system of support, is work.\"",
      "He outlined that the requirements can also be met through community engagement, education and in caretaking roles, and that the administration began pursuing pilot programs when the bill was signed to demonstrate how technology can support the changes. But Brennan noted that according to KFF Health Policy, 92% of adult Medicaid recipients already are working or are caregivers or qualify for other exceptions. Oz said \"they're fine.\"",
      "\"We want to help connect you to the job market and get you into work,\" Oz said of people who are considered able-bodied. \"The goal of health care insurance is to catalyze action in the right direction, to get you healthier, to give you agency over the future, so you recognize you matter, and you should have a job, therefore, to go out and change the world.\"",

He's running for the Democratic nomination in one of the most competitive and high-impact House races in the country, Pennsylvania's 7th District, which flipped from Democratic to Republican in 2024. Crosswell has already raised more than $300,000 since announcing his candidacy in June, while the incumbent Republican, Rep. Ryan MacKenzie, has raised over $1.4 million this year.",

      "She's the granddaughter of civil rights figure Lee Evans, who was among the 1968 Olympics track stars who raised a fist in the air during a medal presentation. Evans told CBS News the Trump administration's dismantling of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division was among her motivations for leaving.",
      "\"We received emails requiring that we report any colleagues doing diversity work in the office. We had 10 to 14 days to report them or we would get in trouble ourselves,\" Evans said. \"That was pretty disgusting.\" She said she didn't feel safe at the agency, in part because she was the co-chair of a diversity effort.",
      "In a campaign video, Evans pledged to challenge Mr. Trump: \"With your vote, I'll take on Trump and demand the community safety we deserve.\" And her campaign materials also promote Evans' work on civil rights issues.",
      "\"I have only worked in public service my entire career. That's the reason why I became a lawyer \u2014 to represent and serve my community,\" Evans said. \"When I realized that that was not going to be possible any longer with the values that the Trump administration was having for the department, I knew I needed to shift.\"",
      "She said her public criticism of the recent changes in the Justice Department is resonating with voters.",

      "The Seattle primaries are Tuesday. If Evans wins enough votes, she'd proceed to a general election in November.",
      "\"It really weighed on my heart\"",
      "Hetal Doshi rose through the ranks of the Justice Department over more than a decade of service, including as deputy assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division. She left in January, when Mr. Trump was sworn in, and is now seeking her first elected office as a candidate in next year's election for Colorado attorney general.",
      "Doshi told CBS News the recent changes at the agency \"really weighed on my heart and on my mind.\"",
      "\"State attorneys general are more important than ever before, in filling an enforcement vacuum,\" she said. \"That's why I made the decision to run for office.\"",
      "\"I faced a lot of complicated feelings about my exit,\" Doshi said, \"and that complexity was coming from the fact that I loved what I did on behalf of the American people so much.\"",

      "The U.S.-Canada relationship has been strained since Mr. Trump came into office in January and repeatedly suggested that Canada could become the \"51st state.\" Carney emphatically denied this in an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump in May, saying Canada is \"not for sale.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: new economic jitters, as turbulence over tariffs intensifies and President Trump fires the person who delivered Friday's week jobs report.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "QUESTION: Mr. President.",
      "QUESTION: Mr. President.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump didn't like Friday's employment report.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): I believe the numbers were phony. So you know what I did? I fired her.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what's behind those numbers and the back-and-forth with the dozens of countries facing new tariffs later this week? We will talk with Trump's top trade negotiator, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, Minister for Canadian U.S.-Trade Dominic LeBlanc.",
      "And for a look at how these developments are impacting Americans, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan will join us.",
      "Plus, what exactly is ahead for Americans who are on Medicare or Medicaid? We will talk to the head of the agency that runs those programs, Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
      "New Mexico has the highest proportion of Medicaid recipients, and the state's Democratic governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, will also be here.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "The jobs report that came out Friday was unexpected and disappointing. There is more uncertainty ahead for American businesses and consumers when it comes to President Trump's plans for imposing new tariffs on imports from some 70 countries now expected this Thursday.",
      "On Friday, we spoke with Mr. Trump's trade representative, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, and we asked him whether he thought there was any chance those rates would be negotiated down in the coming days.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER (U.S. Trade Representative): I don't \u2013 I don't think they will be in the coming days.",
      "I think a lot of these \u2013 well, I know a lot of these, are set rates, pursuant to deals. Some of these deals are announced. Some are not. Others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country.",
      "So \u2013 so these \u2013 these tariff rates are pretty much set.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, at some point, the president's view is maybe a tariff is better than a deal.",
      "Are you saying there are countries that just they have no shot of avoiding a tariff?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Most countries in the world, they just have a tariff assigned to them, right, whether it's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll be the 10 percent or 15 percent.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 10 or 15 or the higher-level tariff, because, again, when the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals.",
      "And we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do. And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then, talking to his advisers, he makes a call on this.",
      "And, you know, sometimes, a country will come back and make additional concessions that \u2013 that make it more appropriate. He's trying to get at the deficit. He's trying to reshore manufacturing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying to reshore manufacturing, bring manufacturing jobs back to America.",
      "But we just saw in this unemployment data that, while the level is pretty low overall, it's pretty steady and good, manufacturing, in particular, we saw it contract for the fifth straight month in July. Factory employment dropped to lowest levels in five years. What does that data indicate to you about the impact of your tariffs?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I think a lot of companies were waiting to see if the tax bill was going to come through with the expensing for capital goods and things like that.",
      "And so I think now you know a lot of that data comes pre-One Big Beautiful Bill. Now that we have One Big Beautiful Bill, and we have a better sense of where the taxes are going. I think we're going to see a much \u2013 we're going to see more investment. All the \u2013 all the commitments on investment we've seen countries making, that's going to come through.",
      "So I don't \u2013 I don't read tariff policy into that number. I think that is kind of pre-bill policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president just announced that the head of labor statistics is being fired because of the weak jobs report, claiming the data was faked.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers. And so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns, you know, not just based on today's, but everything we saw last year.",
      "You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but, sometimes, you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it's \u2013 you know, the president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Canada, which is our second largest \u2013 largest trading partner.",
      "The president increased tariffs to 35 percent. It applies, though, to just about 10 percent of what Canada sells here. Why bother to do this now in the middle of negotiations?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So \u2013 so, I would say, first of all, early on, the president imposed a 25 percent tariff on Canada, and that was really about fentanyl and border issues, right? It's \u2013 it's a separate regime from the reciprocal tariff.",
      "And what did Canada do in response? You know, they talked about helping at the border. And I'm not \u2013 you know, I'm not a \u2013 the drug czar or anything. But what I do know, as the trade guy, is that Canada retaliated. The only other country in the world who retaliated on tariffs was the Chinese.",
      "And so if the president's going to take an action, and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness, so we have to go up too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about the things that the former Prime Minister Trudeau put in place, not the current prime minister?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And are \u2013 and are still in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are still in place.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the current prime minister has held off largely on retaliation here. That's the guy you're negotiating with and his team. So what's the strategy here? And aren't you worried that this will hurt the broader free trade deal if you truly do want to renegotiate it next year?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is, the president is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada. And if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I hear you drawing distinctions when you say, I'm the trade guy. I'm not the drug czar.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm the trade guy. I'm not handling these other things.",
      "But the president is kind of blending all these things together, because he cited fentanyl once again when it came to tariff \u2013 to the policy with Canada. He also said on social media: \"Canada's decision to back statehood for Palestine is going to make it hard for us to make a trade deal.\"",
      "How does that have anything to do with financial and trade agreements?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president of the United States has his foreign affairs power where he can \u2013 he can manage relations under the Constitution with foreign countries.",
      "Congress delegated to the president the ability to take economic action in response to national emergencies in the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And, for example, the Treasury Department, they have a number of sanctions where they can actually cut off a country's trade with the United States, prohibit goods, cut them off from our financial system for geopolitical reasons.",
      "So the fact that they can do that, almost certainly the president can do something that's not as expansive and just \u2013 and just put a fee on those goods, which is a \u2013 which is a tariff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Brazil, because the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil. That means, you know, we sell them more than we buy from them.",
      "So it doesn't seem to be consistent here, when you have the president put 50 percent tariffs on Brazil, one of the highest of any countries. And at the same time, the president is bringing up things that have nothing to do with trade when he's justifying them.",
      "He sent a letter to the current government complaining about the prosecution of his ally Bolsonaro, who is \u2013 who allegedly staged a coup when he lost the last election. The president called it a witch-hunt. This seems politically motivated and not about trade.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: There's a 10 percent tariff on Brazil because we have a surplus with them. That's the reciprocal tariff. And then there's a 40 percent tariff that the president has chosen to do under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 like we would do any sanction where we see geopolitical issues.",
      "The president has seen, in Brazil, like he's seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy, what one might call lawfare. It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues.",
      "I mean, sanctions, we've been using them for years with all kinds of countries, including countries we like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You view tariffs and sanctions as the same?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: They're just different in degree. I mean, tariffs are actually lighter than a sanction. A sanction, you're cutting off a country from your financial system. You're prohibiting trade with them. A tariff, you're allowing trade. You're just putting a fee on it. It's a \u2013 it's a lesser step than sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now you have moved \u2013 you have moved far away from dealing with the deficit.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the deficit has a 10 percent tariff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now you are talking about politically motivated trade actions here.",
      "I mean, the president sent a letter to President Lula saying the tariffs are due in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on free elections. Why are you trying to influence a criminal trial of an ally of President Trump?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president of United States, historically, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, they have used IEEPA to impose sanctions for all kinds of geopolitical reasons in all kinds of countries. Sometimes, it's countrywide. Sometimes, it's specific to certain, you know, individuals, and often foreign leaders and foreign officials.",
      "So this is not \u2013 this is not way outside the market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to trade, the big deal that is pending out there is, how is the president going to deal with China? There's an August 12 deadline. And if that deadline is not met, you have said tariff levels could snap back to above 80 percent.",
      "Is that deadline going to slide?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that's what's under discussion right now. I would say that our conversations with the Chinese have been very positive. We have discussions at the staff level, at my level. You know, President Xi and President Trump have had conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said that it's sliding. The Chinese said it's sliding.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's something we're working toward. That's what we talked about. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not there yet?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And so \u2013 so they want to do that. We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it.",
      "You know, I think it's going in a positive direction. You know, I'm not going to get ahead of the president. But, you know, I don't think anyone wants to see those tariffs snap back to 84 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you get any commitments in those two days of talks in Stockholm?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, yes, we did. Yes, we talked about \u2013 and I won't go into detail, because they're, you know, confidential conversations between two \u2013 two governments, but they really focused on rare earth magnets and minerals.",
      "China has put a global control on the world. And so for the United States, we're focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from China to the United States and the \u2013 and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control. And I would say we're about halfway there.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find our full interview with Ambassador Greer on our Web site, FacetheNation.com, and our YouTube page.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "Good morning, and thank you for being here with us.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN (CEO, Bank of America): It's good to be here again, Margaret. Hope you're doing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm hoping you can give us some clarity here on what's going on with the economy.",
      "Your Bank of America economists say no rate hikes this year and no recession. Is that still the case after Friday's jobs report?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, it's still the case. And that's a \u2013 less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.",
      "And \u2013 but they still think we continue to grow. And we're growing at a slow rate, say 1.5 percent this year, a little more next year, and a little more the year after that. But it will take inflation \u2013 for the Fed to get inflation out of the system really through the end of '26 into '27, down to the 2 percent level.",
      "And that's why they have the Fed holding. What they believe is, sort of in the middle of next year, the Fed will start cutting and bring the Fed funds rate closer to what would be a more normal rate, around 3 percent, 3.5 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, even though we saw this really kind of astounding dissent by two members of the Fed\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 saying, we do need to move on interest rates, your prediction from your economists is that that's not appropriate at this time?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They don't think it's \u2013 they're going to move. Now, the market says they're going to move in September, maybe twice this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The market was at seven times one point this year. Now they're down to two. Then they're down to one. Now they're up to two.",
      "This is going to move around, but the reality is, two things people should really keep in focus. One is, until the inflation is out of the system, the Fed is going to be a little \u2013 very careful. And that's what they said. And then, secondly, the rate we're going to go to is a rate that is more normal than pre-global financial crisis, more of a 3 percent, 3.5 percent rate, which actually means the American economy is probably functioning better, frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on that point, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" we were reading in, puts the tariff tax increase as costing $360 billion a year. That's one of the largest tax increases in history, they say.",
      "Do you believe the administration's arguments that it's really only foreigners who are going to pay the cost of this? Do you think economists are overstating the negative impact?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.",
      "And there's \u2013 so they're trying to extrapolate from things from 50 years ago, when economies were a different structure. Our team thinks it's \u2013 has an impact on inflation of about, you know, 30, 40 basis points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning adding to prices people are paying.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, adding to the inflation rate in the United States.",
      "But we need to back up. What the real impact right now is the new Trump administration coming in had four or five policy areas they were really going to go after, having learned in the four years they had to move very quickly. Those were around trades and tariff, immigration and taxation and deregulation.",
      "What businesses \u2013 and I just was in the Midwest with a bunch of businesses \u2013 they're all trying to do is figure out what the answer will be so they can go ahead and make their plans for '26. So the activity that's slowed down has more to do with people just trying to figure out the answer. It doesn't mean every answer is acceptable, but most answers are.",
      "So what do they have answers on? Obviously, the tax bill getting done. That's a good answer for business, because it makes the rates permanent. What's the second thing they have an answer on? They have an answer now on the range of trade possibilities. And so, as they think about the trade possibilities, they sit there and say, tariffs might not be worse than X. They see some deals getting done, all of which is good work.",
      "What they don't have an answer on is deregulation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, new regulations have stopped, but they are hoping for more deregulation, so that will help their business models going forward.",
      "And then the last is immigration. What will immigration really settle in like? And that's what they tell us. So they're not using their lines of credit. They're not \u2013 the indications from them are, they're being a little more cautious, really waiting for some answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Businesses aren't hiring either, we saw in this jobs data on Friday. It was the worst three months for job growth since the pandemic.",
      "Your firm, when I was reading the analysis, points to a number of different factors, and one of them is artificial intelligence and the adoption of that impacting hiring. How dramatically is it reshaping the job market?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think this is sort of a question of almost a glass half-full/half-empty type of thing. So the impact\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No pun intended.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, exactly.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Sorry about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: But the impact of technology on human work content as a percentage of productivity has been huge.",
      "In our company, at \u2013 in 2010, when I started with the management team, we had 285,000 people. We have 212,000 people today. That was the impact of technology. We're bigger, more customers, more transactions, more reports to the government, more data, et cetera.",
      "So the impact has always been huge. A.I. gives you a place to go that we've never been able to go before. In other words, they're jobs that take text, think about it, and produce it, many, many jobs in our company, our research team. Now you're able to maybe use a machine to enhance that activity.",
      "So we believe that people who harness A.I. for their benefit are going to be very successful. The \u2013 my teammates who harness A.I. for their benefit are very successful. It's nervous-making for young kids now, saying, will the jobs be there for me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Then I say, look back historically. America has a lot more people working here. And think about the amount of technology that came in over the last 50 years, and we have twice as many people working in this country as we did 50 years ago, twice as many.",
      "And the population has only gone up by about a third. So think about that dynamic as it finds its way through. That's the glass-half-full part of it. But it will have an impact. I don't think it's impacting a lot right now, because many companies are just trying to learn how to use it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Technology is impacted, and A.I. gives it a place to go it hasn't gone so far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we're talking about all the unknowns and why it's kind of hard to model things right now.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Exactly, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Friday, the president fired, as you know, the head statistician that comes up with these jobs numbers and presents them to the public.",
      "The former head during the first Trump administration came out in her defense\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and said, this is \u2013 this is without merit, and it undermines credibility of data.",
      "Are you concerned by this firing? And do you feel there is political pressure here?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think that's more politics. And I know I'm in Washington, D.C., and that's what we're supposed to talk about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Government data is \u2013 is\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: But the reality \u2013 the reality is, the data\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 hugely important to modeling, as you know.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's 2025. It's 2025. And the data should be able to be \u2013 they use surveys and things like that, which, frankly, just aren't as effective anymore.",
      "So, if you look at the rate of people who respond to their surveys, it's down from 60 percent level to 50 percent level. You know, we don't use surveys as aggressively. We do \u2013 we watch what consumers really do. We watch what businesses really do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They can get this data, I think, other ways. And I think that's where the focus ought to be. How do we get the data to be more resilient and more predictable and more understandable?",
      "Because what bounces around is restatements. And that was one of the largest restatements going back five or seven years into the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Five years in the pandemic. That creates doubt around it. And so I think the key is, let's get \u2013 let's spend some money. Let's bring the information together. Let's find where else in the government money is reported.",
      "We report millions and millions of data points to the government every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The data is out there somewhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finally, back in January, you were at Davos. President Trump talked about Bank of America.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Many conservatives complained that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America.",
      "This conservative \u2013 they don't take conservative business. And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to respond to the allegation that conservatives are not being allowed to do business with your bank?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender.",
      "So, that's not \u2013 the issue they're focused on is, the regulators' impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this, this week, this reputation, this after-the-fact look that you banked X, and now, after the fact, you're going to say X didn't turn out to be what you thought.",
      "So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for the client.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there \u2013 are there industries you're uncomfortable doing business with?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: No, we do business with\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Guns, oil and gas, tobacco, all of it?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We do business with all those industries.",
      "Individual companies, because of credit decision stuff, that's different. But the reality is, is that, if they gave us clarity for the regulatory thing and avoid the second-guessing, that would be helpful. And I think that's what the president was pointing out, if you listen to him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Brian Moynihan, thank you for giving us some insight into the data you are seeing.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a moment. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Canadian minister for U.S.-Canada trade, Dominic LeBlanc, who joins us this morning from Moncton, Canada.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC (Minister for Canadian U.S.-Trade): Good morning, Ms. Brennan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were just here in Washington negotiating. And while the talks are officially continuing, you left town without a deal, and you left town with now what is a 35 percent tariff on goods.",
      "How much of a setback was the president's decision to do that while you are still at the table?",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: So we were obviously \u2013 obviously disappointed by that decision.",
      "We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together. That's been the history of the 40-year free trade agreement that goes back to President Reagan. We were pleased the United States is respecting the terms of the USMCA agreement.",
      "That's vital, we think, to the cost of living and affordability certainly in the United States. It's true in Canada as well. So we're continue to do the work. We left always with a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship.",
      "Ambassador Greer, Secretary Lutnick engage with us in constructive, cordial conversations. So we're prepared to stick around and do the work needed. We think, Ms. Brennan, that the economies of both countries are strengthened when we do things together. The trading relationship between Canada and the United States is unlike other partners.",
      "One description which I \u2013 which I thought was very apt, we don't sell things to each other, as much as we build things together. And that's why it's difficult in this relationship when so much is integrated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: But we remain very optimistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but you heard Ambassador Greer say, Canada \u2013 because Canada retaliated to the initial tariffs all the way back in April, when Prime Minister Trudeau was in office, you're paying the price now, even though you have a new government in place.",
      "If that's the issue, why not make that concession and pull back?",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: So, Prime Minister Carney, our new prime minister, has, we think, built a very businesslike, respectful relationship with President Trump.",
      "We think that's obviously very important to Canada and we think to the United States. We're dealing with \u2013 take, for example, the steel sector in Canada. It's a strategic importance to national security in Canada, as it is for President Trump and the American economy.",
      "We now have a situation where there's a 50 percent tariff. We're the biggest steel export market for the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: We have a 25 percent tariff. There's a 50 percent tariff when we want to sell something into the United States. So, effectively, we're blocked from doing that.",
      "But the national security interests of Canada requires that we have a viable steel and aluminum sector. And my conversations with Secretary Lutnick and others are that therein lies an example where, if we do the right work together \u2013 we have, Ms. Brennan, the toughest rules of any country dealing with Chinese dumping into Canada.",
      "We have melt and pour tracing so that products coming from other countries with Chinese steel can't be dumped into the Canadian market. So we're looking and advancing ideas where we can do that work with the United States, at the same time ensuring that our economy continues to have sectors vital to the economic future of Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: But that's not in contradiction to President Trump's national security objectives in the United States, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to talk to you more about this idea of the so-called fortress North America to take on China and some of the specifics of the dispute on the other side of this commercial break.",
      "Please stay with us. We will have more questions for Minister LeBlanc shortly. We will see you in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including an interview with the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz. And the Democratic governor of the state of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham, will join us.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with the Canadian minister for U.S.-Canada trade, Dominic Leblanc.",
      "Minister, we were just talking about some of the sectoral tariffs, the metals. American automakers, GM, Ford, Stellantis, they have all said that these tariffs are hurting their profits. The 50 percent metal tariffs, which use Canadian aluminum, the secretary of the Treasury was talking about those just the other day, they're see the impact here in the United States. A bit of a backfire in some ways. Do you see room for maneuver on these? Are they willing to negotiate with you on those tariffs?",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC (Minister for Canada-U.S. Trade): Ms. Brennan, we \u2013 we hope so. And as I say, we're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies.",
      "But your example is a good one. Canadian aluminum companies massively supply the American market. And by putting a 50 percent tariff on aluminum from Canada, you've increased the price of a whole series of goods. The automobile sector again is an example where there's been deep integration.",
      "We're the biggest customer of U.S.-made automobiles. Heavily, heavily importing into Canada, light and heavy-duty trucks. Fifty percent of the cars that we have finished in Canada and sell to the United States are made up of American parts. So, therein lies a perfect example where instead of tariffing one another, or President Trump, for his national security reasons under his Section 232 tariffs, wants to have a strong domestic steel, aluminum, automobile sector. Well, so does Canada. And we \u2013 we understand and respect totally the president's view in terms of the national security interests. In fact, we share it. And what we've said to our American counterparts is, how can we structure the right agreement where we can both continue to supply one another \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: In a reliable, cost effective way that preserves jobs essential to the American economy, but the same thing is true obviously in Canada as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, are there any plans for the two leaders to speak? I saw President Trump said your prime minister called him Thursday and they just never connected. I mean are tensions that high? And given the changing justification for the tariffs, do you really feel like you're negotiating with the other side in good faith?",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: Sure, we do. Of course we do. As I say, the conversations have been informative, constructive, and cordial. I would expect the prime minister will have a conversation with the president over the next number of days. That's certainly my plan again with Secretary Lutnick, recognizing that we think there is an option of striking a deal that will bring down some of these tariffs, provide greater certainty to investment.",
      "We, Ms. Brennan, we passed in Canada our version of the president's one big, beautiful bill, it's called the One Canadian Economy Act, which we think will unlock up to $500 billion of investment in Canada for things like pipelines, port infrastructure, mines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: All of which offer huge opportunities to American businesses as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: So, we think there's a great deal \u2013 a great deal to work on together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Minister, we'll see if you can get one.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Change is coming for the country's Medicaid system as part of the enactment of the big, beautiful bill.",
      "To help us understand what's ahead, we turn now to the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
      "Good morning. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "DR. MEHMET OZ (Administrator, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got a lot of work ahead. I want to start on drug costs. The president put this 25 percent tariff on India. A big drug producer. The president's trade deal with the E.U. puts a 15 percent tariff on imported medicines from Europe. How do you stop the drugmakers from passing along those costs to people on Medicare and Medicaid?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, the president's letter on Thursday, for most favored nation pricing, is a good example of that. And he's been working on this tirelessly since the first administration.",
      "And just to put this in context for many of the viewers, about two-thirds of bankruptcies in America are caused by healthcare expenses. About a third of people when they go to the pharmacy, they leave empty handed. They can't afford the medication. So, the president has said, enough global freeloading.",
      "We've been covering much of the development costs for new drugs to cure cancer, do other things with lots of other illnesses that are life- threatening. Isn't (ph) it time for the American public to understand that we should not be paying three times more for the exact same medication in the same box, made in the same factory.",
      "So, the president is saying, equalize it out. Let's use a model that worked, for example, for external threats, that's what NATO did. Everyone has to pay a little more. We'll pay extra too. But we won't pay a lot more than everybody else so they actually have to raise their \u2013 their \u2013 if you cut contributions, in this case to an internal threat, which is illness, we'll pay a little less in America that way more Americans can afford these medications and it's a fair system for the entire globe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this was declared in these letters that were sent out to 17 pharmaceutical companies this past week and it calls for extending that to Medicaid drug prices. Is that intended to offset what will be, you know, cuts to Medicaid? And do you know, you know, if the companies are actually going to follow through on this? Like, how do you actually strong arm them into doing it?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, just get the numbers correct. We're putting 200 billion more dollars into Medicaid. So, we're actually investing in Medicaid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At a time when costs are going up. So \u2013",
      "MEHMET OZ: Costs are going up, but there's been a 50 percent increase in the cost of Medicaid over the last five years. So, I'm trying to save this beautiful program, this noble effort to help folks, giving them a hand up. And as you probably gather, if Medicaid isn't able to take care of the people for whom it was designed, the young children, at the dawn of their life, those at the twilight of their life, the seniors, and those who are disabled, living in the shadows as Hubert Humphrey said, then we're not satisfying the fundamental obligation of a moral government.",
      "And this president has said over and over that he believes that it is the wise thing and the \u2013 and the noble thing to help those who are vulnerable. And every great society does that. And we're going to as well.",
      "So, we're going to invest in Medicaid, as is required, but we want an appropriate return on that investment.",
      "One thing that Medicaid patients should not face are drug prices they can't afford.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Because then \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you enforce this with the pharmaceutical companies?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, the \u2013 the pharmaceutical companies, if you sit them down quietly, Margaret, and we've done that, and say, you went into this business at some point because you cared about people. I know there's many out there shaking their heads, but that is actually the truth. People go into healthcare, whether they're pharmaceutical companies or insurance companies or the PBMs or anybody in the space, evidence (ph), the CMS, the most impressive thing to me in my new task that the president's appointed me to is the remarkable quality of the people within the organization. Just unbelievably talented. They went into this job because they care about healthcare and about people.",
      "Somewhere along the lines people forget, they put numbers ahead of patients. And when that happens, then you start running into problems. So, we went to the pharmaceutical companies and we said, you appreciate this is not a fair system. We should not be paying more in America, three times more, for your products than you charge in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They get the joke. They understand the reality of this problem. They're engaging with us. We're in the middle of those negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The president has a unique power to convene. We've done it with dealing with prior authorization, this heinous process where patients feel like they're, you know, trying to get care from a doctor, everything's being done except all of a sudden the \u2013 the arm of insurance comes in and stops the whole process for unknown reasons, for week, sometimes months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Your \u2013 the insurance companies representing 80 percent of the American public got together and they said, because we pushed them, we're going to deal with this. We can do the same, I believe with the pharmaceutical industry, with most favored nation pricing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the changes that are coming because of this new law to Medicaid, which is jointly administered between the feds and the states. There are major reductions to federal healthcare spending here. One of the changes are these work requirements. It's about 20 hours a week, volunteer or work, to qualify for healthcare.",
      "What is the guidance you are giving to states on how to implement this? Because in this economy, things are more complicated. Uber driver, independent contractor, how do they show they work their 20 hours a week?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Last weekend I was at the National Governor's Association, with Secretary Kennedy, who has been a big advocate of work as well. And every Democratic president, and Republican president, has said that the foundation of a healthy welfare system, of a social system of support, is work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but I'm \u2013 but I'm asking how you actually implement that and register it so that people who are working do qualify and they don't get caught up in paperwork because they didn't file something on time, that kind of thing.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Right. As long as we're OK that people should work and would want to work, and it's not just work, it's community engagement. They can go get education, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They can take care of family members.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They can contribute in other ways. But work's a great way of doing it. It can get you out of poverty if you can find jobs and elevate yourself.",
      "There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven't been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now and we have invested already, as soon as the bill was signed, began pilots to try to demonstrate that we can actually do this correctly. We have pilots now in Louisiana and in Arizona.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: In both cases, within seven minutes, you can click on where you're working \u2013 you mentioned Uber. You're an Uber driver. You click that button on your phone. It just takes you to your payroll provider. Let's say it's ADP. We then ask your permission, can we connect with this payroll provider to \u2013 to demonstrate what you've actually been able to work and earn over the past month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: This also, by the way, confirms your eligibility.",
      "But there's a bigger benefit here. Once you do that, you're in, you're done. However, what if we take it one step further, Margaret? What if we go beyond just proving that you tried to work, to actually saying, you know what, you didn't work enough but we can actually help you by connecting you through employment office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're still figuring out the technology, but isn't there an end of December deadline for a lot of these things to be figured out, and how do you make sure that people don't get kicked off because, in the state of Georgia, which already had work requirements, they have really struggled to make this work.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, a couple of things. It's not the end of December. It's the end of December a year from now. And Georgia is apples and oranges. Georgia had a program only for people under the poverty level and, for those people, if they wanted, they could elect to come into a system to help them get jobs. There have been 50,000 reduction in head count of uninsured people in the overall program in the last five years. Overall, Georgia, 2 million less uninsured people. So, Georgia is using a lot of tactics, and they're going in the right direction.",
      "I would argue that if you have confidence in the American people and their desire to take the offer to try to get a job if we challenge you to that, and, remember, if you're an able-bodied person on Medicaid \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: You're spending 6.1 hours watching television or leisure time. So, you don't want that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Kafa (ph) Health Policy found 92 percent of adult Medicaid recipients already are working or they have the carve out because they have to have caregivers or they have to do other things.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They're fine. All they have to do is \u2013 there will be a simple app. If you're already carved out, that's super simple. If you're supposed to be \u2013 if you're able-bodied and you're supposed to be working, we want to help connect you to the job market and get you into work. We have twice as many jobs available in America as people seem to want them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The foundation of work is not just about fulfilling eligibility. The goal of healthcare insurance is to catalyze action in the right direction, to get you healthier, to give you agency over your future so you recognize you matter and you should have a job there for \u2013 to go out and change the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "So, there's a drug addiction problem in the country. How are those changes going to impact people who are on Medicaid in states like Kentucky, in states like West Virginia?",
      "MEHMET OZ: In many instances there are carveouts for folks who need \u2013 who have substance use disorder problems. There are programs to support \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do they prove that?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, they can either \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that in the app?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Yes, it will be in app. And the app, again, if we're being \u2013 but this is being developed by the United States Digital Service led by Amy Gleason, who is a wonderful technologist. She and I were with the president and Secretary Kennedy and the head of the \u2013 the czar for A.I. in this country on Wednesday talking about overall how we're going to change the use of health technology in America. We've got to get into 2025 with health technology, as is true in every other sector.",
      "If you're watching the show right now, you could also have been streaming media. You could take an Uber somewhere, ride share. You can do an Airbnb. Technology should make the system more efficient.",
      "We should have confidence that it will also allow us to do what we all agree is possible. If the whole challenge to a work requirement is that you don't have confidence in our ability to accomplish it, that's a separate question, because I do have confidence in the American people and we have confidence we can pull this off.",
      "Look at the passport system, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Right now you can go and get a passport in two weeks without having to go to the post office, send pictures in, all that's gone. It's fixable. Let's use technology.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm still confused on how someone who is in the throes of substance abuse is going to use an app to say I'm in the throes of substance abuse every week to file online, but \u2013",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, when they go \u2013 when they go in to get their help for their substance abuse treatment, assuming they're going for help on that, they can also get enrolled in \u2013 and those requirements can be fulfilled.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: We want to talk to them in as many ways as possible. It's not going to happen just because we put an app out there. You \u2013 you have social workers, other folk \u2013 elements who care a lot about this population who are coming together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: But they have to have some mechanism to report back. That just has not been done well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and this is incredibly detailed, and that's why we wanted to have you on. I have so many more questions for you on rural hospitals and \u2013 and some of the other criticisms. I have to leave it there for now but thank you, Dr. Oz.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Can I give you 30 seconds on rural hospitals? Because this is important.",
      "You have 7 percent of Medicaid money going to rural hospitals. We're putting $50 billion. The president wants this. The congress wants this. It will make a massive dent (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are a lot of questions about how you're going to dole that out and whether you have already made promises. Do you have any specifics for us?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Yes, we \u2013 we \u2013 it's going to be \u2013 they'll get the applications in early September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The \u2013 the \u2013 the money is designed to help you with workforce development, right sizing the system and using technology to provide things like telehealth that can change the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Imagine if we can change the way we think about the delivery of health and make it more about getting people healthy so you can thrive and flourish and be fully present in their own lives and as Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Oz, we'll leave it there.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn to New Mexico's Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. She joins us from Santa Fe.",
      "Governor, two out of five New Mexicans are on Medicaid. You've got a lot of rural hospitals. Have you figured out how to implement everything Dr. Oz just laid out?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM (D-NM): Absolutely not. There is no real way to implement this. It's more paperwork for everyone. It's more paperwork for federal government, for state governments, for county governments, for local hospitals, for independent providers. And you know what Americans really hate, Margaret? When you go to your primary care physician, and you spend 20 minutes sitting at a chair, not even on the exam table, while they are inputting data into a computer. So, this doesn't make any sense.",
      "We should be a society and a country that is connecting people to healthcare providers. I think the one thing that Dr. Oz represents, that's a fair representation, is, we should be healthier as Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: All right. And we need to be moving out of poverty. We need drug prices, we should talk about that, to come down. So, go after insurance companies. Do manufacturing here. Make sure we can negotiate fair prices. Let states do that. Because I guarantee you, we'll do a better job than the federal government.",
      "And lastly, get people early easy access. Today, more than half, or about half, our small businesses don't even offer healthcare coverage. So, you can get a job, but now what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, you said, though, in your state, because, as a governor, you're going to have to figure this out.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have reserve cash from some oil and gas revenues, as I understand it, that have been put aside. Doesn't that show it is possible for the federal government to shift more responsibility back to the states? That's the argument conservatives are making.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: They are. And it's temporary. There is no way any state, including this one, which, frankly, I am really proud of, we are in really good financial shape. That takes planning and effort.",
      "You know, our job projections continue to be met and exceed, unlike the federal jobs report, which is going in the opposite direction. So, I don't know where all these jobs are going to be in this anemic economy. I mean, it's so bad, with \u2013 the last time it was this bad, I was in college. And let me tell you, that was a very long time ago.",
      "And so, yes, temporarily, we can do that. But you can't do it over the long haul. The loss minimally to New Mexico over less than a decade is between $12 billion and $13 billion. And when, not if, rural hospitals and local providers close their doors, I can do this better than any other state. The last governor completely canceled behavioral health.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Six years later, we are still reeling from trying to rebuild. We put a billion dollars into behavioral health just this last legislative session. It is not so easy to rebuild something out of nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the $50 billion rural healthcare fund under this Republican law is supposed to give people the \u2013 your \u2013 states like yours the ability to come and say, we need this extra cash. Are you going to have to ask for that?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: I'm going to ask for every dollar the federal government has put aside anywhere that benefits a New Mexican. So, you've got $50 billion, that's $1 billion for each state if it was even. Do you know how much money it would take to shore up rural hospitals? More than a billion. And to put that in perspective, let me do this. It's a billion just for behavioral health. It's a billion plus just to keep people's coverage. It's another billion for prescription drugs. It's a billion dollars for rural provider delivery investments. And that's only 50 hospitals. You have hundreds of hospitals, hundreds, 400 rural hospitals across America that will shutter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: So, that's the number, at (ph) it is. We are \u2013 how do we pick these rural hospitals? And if you pick a southeastern rural hospital in New Mexico, what about the rural hospital in western New Mexico?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Economies fail. People have to move away. You don't have any OBGYN care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: That whole area collapses. And they are reducing rural healthcare delivery by about $134 billion. So, the $50 billion is just to make someone, somewhere feel like they recognize that this is a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: $900 billion out of Medicaid is catastrophic. Straight up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we ran through a lot of material here. I have more questions for you. But very quickly, can you tell me, you deployed the National Guard to counter unrest in New Mexico. How is that different from what the president did in California?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Well, they're not policing. They're doing the back-end work so that trained community policing and members of that training, right, those local police officers, they're on the streets. What we have in this country is a shortage of police officers. What I have in New Mexico is a partnership. So, they're doing all of the \u2013 they answer all of the emergency calls. They handle all the traffic clearance when we've got a crash. And it is working. We're beginning to see more productive fentanyl, drug-dealing high-end arrests than we did without The Guard. And I'm really proud of that work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Dr. Mehmet Oz, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Change is coming for the country's Medicaid system as part of the enactment of the Big, Beautiful Bill. To help us understand what's ahead, we turn now to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz. Good morning. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "DR. MEHMET OZ: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got a lot of work ahead. I want to start on drug costs. The president put this 25% tariff on India, big drug producer. The President's trade deal with the EU puts a 15 percent tariff on imported medicines from Europe. How do you stop the drug makers from passing along those costs to people on Medicare and Medicaid?",
      "DR. MEHMET OZ: Well, the president's letter on Thursday for most favored nation pricing is a good example of that, and he's been working on this tirelessly since the first administration. And just to put this in context for many of the viewers, about two thirds of bankruptcies in America are caused by health care expenses. About a third of people when they go to the pharmacy, they leave empty handed. They can't afford the medication. So the President has said, Enough global freeloading. We've been covering much of the development costs for new drugs to cure cancer, deal with lots of other illnesses that are life threatening. It is in time for the American public to understand that we should not be paying three times more for the exact same medication in the same box, made in the same factories. The president's saying, equalize it out. Let's use a model that's worked, for example, for external threats, that's what NATO did. Everyone has to pay a little more. We'll pay extra too, but we won't pay a lot more than everybody else, so they actually have to raise their contributions, in this case, to an internal threat, which is illness. We'll pay a little less than America that way more Americans can afford these medications, and it's a fair system for the entire globe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was declared in these letters that were sent out to 17 pharmaceutical companies this past week, and it calls for extending that to Medicaid drug prices. Is that intended to offset what will be, you know, cuts to Medicaid? And do you know, you know, if the companies are actually going to follow through on this, like, how do you actually strong arm them into doing it?",
      "DR. OZ: Well just get the numbers correct. We're putting 200 billion more dollars into Medicaid. So we're actually investing\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014by the time when costs are going up, so.",
      "DR. OZ: Costs are going up, but there's been a 50 percent increase in the cost of Medicaid over the last five years. So I'm trying to save this beautiful program, this noble effort, to help folks giving them a hand up. And as you probably gather, if Medicaid isn't able to take care of the people for whom it was designed, the young children, the dawn of their life, those are the twilight of their life, the seniors and those who are disabled living in the shadows, as Hubert Humphrey said, then we're not satisfying the fundamental obligation of a moral government. And this President has said over and over that he believes that it is the wise thing and the noble thing to help those who are vulnerable and every great society does that, we're going to as well. So we're going to invest in Medicaid as is required, but we want an appropriate return on that investment. One thing that Medicaid patients should not face are drug prices they can't afford.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, how do you enforce this? Pharmaceutical companies\u2014",
      "DR. OZ: Well, the pharmaceutical companies, if you sit them down quietly, Margaret, and we've done that, and say you went into this business at some point, because you cared about people. I know there's many out there shaking their heads, but that is actually the truth. People go into health care, whether they're pharmaceutical companies or insurance companies or the PBMs or anybody in the space. Even at the CMS, the most impressive thing to me in my new task, and the President has appointed me to, is the remarkable quality of people within the organization, just unbelievably talented. They went into this job because they care about health care and about people. Somewhere along the lines, people forget. They put numbers ahead of patients. And when that happens, then you start running into problems. We went to the pharmaceutical companies and we said, you appreciate this is not a fair system. We should not be paying more in America, three times more, for your products than you charge in Europe. They get the joke. They understand the reality of this problem. They are engaging with us. We're in the middle of those negotiations. The President has a unique power to convene. We've done it with dealing with prior authorization, this heinous process where patients feel like they're trying to get care from a doctor. Everything's being done except all of a sudden the arm of insurance comes in and stops the whole process for unknown reasons for weeks, sometimes months. The insurance companies, representing 80 percent of the American public, got together and they said, because we pushed them, we're going to deal with this. We can do the same, I believe, with the pharmaceutical industry, with most favored nation pricing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the changes that are coming because of this new law to Medicaid, which is jointly administered between the feds and the states. There are major reduction- reductions to federal health care spending here, one of the changes are these work requirements. It's about 20 hours a week, volunteer or work to qualify for health care. What is the guidance you are giving to states on how to implement this? Because in this economy, things are more complicated. Uber driver, independent contractor, how do they show they work their 20 hours a week?",
      "DR. OZ: Last weekend, I was at the National Governors Association with Secretary Kennedy, who has been a big advocate of work as well. Every Democratic president and Republican president has said that the foundation of a healthy welfare system of a social system of support is work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but I'm asking how you actually implement that and register it so that people who are working do qualify, and they don't get caught up in paperwork because they didn't file something on time.",
      "DR. OZ: As long as we're okay that people should work and would want to work, and it's not just work, it's community engagement. They can go get educated, right? They can take care of family members. They can contribute in other ways, but work is a great way of doing and get you out of poverty if you can find jobs and elevate yourself. There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven't been able to achieve what we can achieve, because we have technologies now. And we've invested already, as soon as the bill was signed, began pilots to try to demonstrate that we can actually do this correctly. We have pilots now in Louisiana and in Arizona, in both cases, within seven minutes, you can click on where you're working. You mentioned Uber, you're an Uber driver. You click that button on your phone. It just takes you to your payroll provider. Let's say it's ADP. We then ask your permission, can we connect with this payroll provider to demonstrate what you've actually been able to work and earn over the past month? This also, by the way, confirms your eligibility. But there's a bigger benefit here. Once you do that, you're in, you're done. However, what if we take one step further, Margaret? What if we go beyond just proving that you tried the work to actually say, You know what, you didn't work enough, but we can actually help you by connecting you through an employment office?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're still figuring out the technology, but isn't there an end-of-December deadline for a lot of these things to be figured out? And how do you make sure that people don't get kicked off? Because in the state of Georgia, which already had work requirements, they have really struggled to make this work.",
      "DR. OZ: Well, a couple of things. It's not the end of December, it's end of December a year from now, and Georgia is apples and oranges. Georgia had a program only for people under the poverty level, and for those people, if they wanted, they could elect to come into a system to help them get jobs. There have been 50,000 reduction in head count of uninsured people in the overall program in the last five years. Overall, Georgia, 2 million less uninsured people. So Georgia is using a lot of tactics, and they're going in the right direction. I would argue that if you have confidence in the American people and their desire to take to offer to try to get a job, if we challenge you to that. And remember, if you're an able-bodied person on Medicaid, you're spending 6.1 hours watching television or leisure time, so you don't want that\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014Well, KFF Health Policy found 92 percent of adult Medicaid recipients already are working. Or they have the carve out because they have to have caregivers, or they have to do other things.",
      "DR. OZ: They're fine. All they have to do is there'll be a simple app. If you've already carved out, that's super simple. If you're supposed to be if you're able-bodied and supposed to be working, we want to help connect you to the job market and get you into work. We have twice as many jobs available in America as people who seem to want them. The foundation of work is not just about fulfilling eligibility. The goal of health care insurance is to catalyze action in the right direction, to get you healthier, to give you agency over your future, so you recognize you matter, and you should have a job, therefore to go out and change the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's a drug addiction problem in this country. How are those changes going to impact people who are on Medicaid in states like Kentucky, in states like West Virginia?",
      "DR. OZ: In many instances, there are carve outs for folks who have substance use disorder problems. There are programs--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014How do they prove that?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR OZ: Well, they can\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this in the app?",
      "DR. OZ: Yes, it will be in the app. The app, again, this is being developed by the United States Digital Service, led by Amy Gleason, who is a wonderful technologist. She and I were with the President and Secretary Kennedy and the head of the czar for AI in this country on Wednesday, talking about overall how we're going to change the use of health technology in America. We've got to get into 2025 with health technology, as is true in every other sector. If you're watching the show right now, you could also be streaming media. You could take an Uber somewhere, the rideshare. You could do an Airbnb. Technology should make the system more efficient. We should have confidence that it will also allow us to do what we all agree is possible. If the whole challenge to a work requirement is that you don't have confidence in our ability to accomplish it, that's a separate question, because I do have confidence in the American people, and we have confidence we can pull this off. Look at the passport system, Margaret. Right now, you can go and get a passport in two weeks without having to go to the post office, send pictures, and all that's gone. It's fixable. Let's use technology.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm still confused on how someone who is in the throes of substance abuse is going to use an app to say, I'm in the throes of substance abuse every week, to file on online\u2014",
      "DR. OZ: \u2014When they go in to get their help for their substance abuse treatment, assuming they're going for help on that, they can also get enrolled in, in those requirements, can be fulfilled. We want to talk to them in as many ways as possible. It's not going to happen just because we put an app out there, you, you have social workers and other folk elements who care a lot about this population, who are coming together, but they have to have some mechanism to report back. That just has not been done well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and this is incredibly detailed, and that's why we wanted to have you on. I have so many more questions for you on rural hospitals and some of the other criticisms. I have to leave it there for now. But thank you, Dr. Oz--",
      "DR. OZ: Can I give you 30 seconds on rural hospitals, because this is important. You have 7 percent of Medicaid money going to rural hospitals. We're putting 50 billion dollars the president wants us to, Congress wants to\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are a lot questions on how you're going to duel that out, and whether you have already made promises. Do you have any specifics for us?",
      "DR. OZ: Yes. Wait, wait, it's going to be, they'll get the applications in early September. The money is designed to help you with workforce development, right sizing the system and using technology to provide things like telehealth that can change the world. Imagine if we can change the way we think about the delivery of health and make it more about getting people healthy so they can thrive and flourish and be fully present in their own lives and as Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr Oz, we'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Dominic LeBlanc, Canadian Minister for U.S.-Canada Trade, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Canadian Minister for U.S.-Canada trade, Dominic LeBlanc, who joins us this morning from Moncton, Canada. Good morning to you.",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: Good morning, Ms. Brennan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were just here, in Washington, negotiating. And while the talks are officially continuing, you left town without a deal, and you left town with, now, what is a 35% tariff on goods. How much of a setback was the President's decision to do that while you are still at the table?",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: So we were obviously\u2014obviously disappointed by that decision. We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together. That's been the history of the 40-year Free Trade Agreement that goes back to President Reagan. We were pleased the United States is respecting the terms of the USMCA agreement. That's vital, we think, to the cost of living and affordability, certainly in the United States, it's true in Canada, as well. So, we're going to continue to do the work. We left, always, with a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship. Ambassador Greer, Secretary Lutnick, engaged with us in constructive, cordial conversations. So we're prepared to stick around and do the work needed. We think, Ms. Brennan, that the economies of both countries are strengthened when we do things together, the trading relationship between Canada and the United States is unlike other partners. One description, without which I thought was very apt; we don't sell things to each other as much as we build things together. And that's why it's- it's difficult in this relationship when so much is integrated. But we remain very optimistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you heard Ambassador Greer say Canada\u2014because Canada retaliated to the initial tariffs all the way back in April, when Prime Minister Trudeau was in office, you're paying the price now, even though you have a new government in place. If that's the issue, why not make that concession and pull back?",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: So, Prime Minister Carney, our new prime minister, has, we think, built a very business-like, respectful relationship with President Trump. We think that's obviously very important to Canada, and we think to the United States. We're dealing with, take, for example, the steel sector in Canada. It's a strategic importance to national security in Canada, as it is for President Trump and the American economy. We now have a situation where there's a 50% tariff. We're the biggest steel export market for the United States. We have a 25% tariff. There's a 50% tariff when we want to sell something into the United States. So, effectively, we're blocked from doing that. But the national security interest of Canada requires that we have a viable steel and aluminum sector, and my conversations with Secretary Lutnick and others are that therein lies an example, where if we do the right work together, we have, Ms. Brennan, the toughest rules of any country dealing with Chinese dumping into Canada. We have melt and pour tracing, so that products coming from other countries with Chinese steel can't be dumped into the Canadian market. So, we're looking and advancing ideas where we can do that work with the United States, at the same time, ensuring that our economy continues to have sectors vital to the economic future of Canada. But, that's not in contradiction to President Trump's national security objectives in the United States, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to talk to you more about this idea of the so-called fortress North America to take on China, and some of the specifics of the dispute on the other side of this commercial break. Please stay with us. We'll have more questions for Minister LeBlanc shortly. We'll you see in a moment.",
      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with the Canadian Minister for US-Canada trade, Dominic LeBlanc. Minister, we were just talking about some of the sectoral tariffs, the metals. American automakers, GM, Ford, Stellantis, they have all said that these tariffs are hurting their profits. The 50% metal tariffs, which use Canadian aluminum, the Secretary of the Treasury was talking about those just the other day, they're seeing the impact here in the United States, a bit of a backfire in some ways. Do you see room for maneuver on these? Are they willing to negotiate with you on those tariffs?",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: Ms. Brennan, we hope so. And, as I say, we're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies. But your example is a good one. Canadian aluminum companies massively supply the American market. And by putting a 50% tariff on aluminum from Canada, you've increased the price of a whole series of goods. The automobile sector, again, is an example where there's been deep integration. We're the biggest customer of U.S. made automobiles. Heavily, heavily importing into Canada light and heavy-duty trucks. 50% of the cars that we finish in Canada and sell to the United States are made up of American parts. So, therein lies a perfect example where, instead of tariffing one another, or President Trump for his national security reasons, under his Section 232, tariffs, wants to have a strong domestic steel, aluminum automobile sector. Well, so does Canada. And we understand and respect totally the President's view in terms of the national security interest. In fact, we share it, and what we've said to our American counterparts is, how can we structure the right agreement, where we can both continue to supply one another in a reliable, cost-effective way that preserves jobs essential to the American economy, but the same thing is true, obviously in Canada as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there any plans for the two leaders to speak? I saw President Trump said your prime minister called him Thursday, and they just never connected. I mean, are tensions that high? And given the changing justification for the tariffs, do you really feel like you're negotiating with the other side in good faith?",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: Sure, we do. Of course we do. As I say, the conversations have been informative, constructive, and cordial. I would expect the Prime Minister will have a conversation with the President over the next number of days. That's certainly my plan, again with Secretary Lutnick, recognizing that we think there is an option of striking a deal that will bring down some of these tariffs, provide greater certainty to investment. We, Ms. Brennan, we passed, in Canada, our version of the President's One Big, Beautiful Bill. It's called the One Canadian Economy Act, which we think will unlock up to $500 billion of investment in Canada for things like pipelines, port infrastructure, mines, all of which offer huge opportunities to American businesses as well. So, we think there's a great deal- a great deal to work on together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Minister, we'll see if you can get one. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Bank of America CEO, Brian Moynihan, good morning, and thank you for being here with us.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Good to be here again, Margaret, hope you're doing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm hoping you can give us some clarity here on what's going on with the economy. Your Bank of America economists say no rate hikes this year and no recession. Is that still the case after Friday's jobs report?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yeah, it's still the case, and that's a\u2014less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that\u2014but they still think we continue to grow. And we're growing at a slow rate, say, one and a half percent this year, little more next year, and a little more the year after that. But it will take inflation\u2014for the Fed to get inflation out of the system, really through the end of '26 into '27 down to the 2% level. And that's why they have the Fed holding. What they believe is sort of in the middle of next year, the Fed will start cutting and bring the Fed funds rate closer to what would be a more normal rate, around three percent, three and a half percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though we saw this, really, kind of astounding dissent by two members of the Fed saying, we do need to move on interest rates. Your prediction from your economists is that that's not appropriate at this time.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They don't think it's\u2014they're going to move. Now, the market says they're going to move in September, maybe twice this year. The market was at seven times one point this year. Now they're down to two\u2014then they're down to one, now they're up to two. This is going to move around, but the reality is, two things people should really keep in focus. One is, until the inflation is out of the system, the Fed is going to be a little\u2014very careful, and that's what they said. And then secondly, the rate we're going to go to is a rate that is more normal than pre-global financial crisis, more of a 3%, 3.5% percent rate, which actually means the American economy is probably functioning better, frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, the Wall Street Journal, we were reading in, puts the tariff tax increase as costing $360 billion a year. That's one of the largest tax increases in history, they say. Do you believe the administration's arguments that it's really only foreigners who are going to pay the cost of this. Do you think economists are overstating the negative impact?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before. And there's- so they're trying to extrapolate from things from 50 years ago, when economies were different structured. Our team thinks it's- has an impact on inflation of about a, you know, 30, 40 basis points\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning adding to prices people are paying.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yeah, adding to the inflation rate in the United States. But we need to back up. What the real impact right now is the new Trump administration coming in had four or five policy areas they were really going to go after, having learned in the four years, they had to move very quickly. Those were around trades and tariff, immigration and taxation and deregulation. What businesses, and I just was in the Midwest with a bunch of businesses, they're all trying to do is figure out what the answer will be so they can go ahead and make their plans for '26. So the activity that's slowed down has more to do with people just trying to figure out the answer. It doesn't mean every answer is acceptable. Most answers are. So what do they have answers on? Obviously, a tax bill getting done. That's a good answer for business, because it makes the rates permanent. What's the second thing they have an answer on. They have an answer now on the range of trade possibilities. And so as they think about the trade possibilities, they sit there and say, tariffs might not be worse than x. They see some deals getting done, all of which is good work. What they don't have an answer on is deregulation. Yes, new regulations stop, but they are hoping for more deregulation, so that will help their business models going forward. And then the last is immigration. What will immigration really settle in like. And that's what they tell us. So they're not using their lines of credit, they're not- the indications from them are they're being a little more cautious, really waiting for some answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Businesses aren't hiring, either, we saw in this jobs data on Friday, that was the worst three months for job growth since the pandemic. Your firm, when I was reading the analysis, points to a number of different factors, and one of them is artificial intelligence and the adoption of that impacting hiring. How dramatically is it reshaping the job market?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I think this is sort of a question of almost a glass half full, half empty type of thing. So the impact\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No pun intended.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Exactly, sorry about that. But the impact of technology on human work content as a percentage of productivity has been huge. In our company- in 2010 when I started with the management team, we had 285,000 people. We have 212,000 people today. That was the impact of technology. We're bigger, more customers, more transactions, more reports to the government, more data, et cetera. So the impact has always been huge. AI gives you a place to go that we've never been able to go before. In other words, they're jobs that take text, think about it, and produce it. Many, many jobs in a company. Our research team, now you're able to maybe use a machine to enhance that activity. So we believe that people harness AI for their benefit are going to be very successful. My teammates who harness AI for their benefit are very successful. It's nervous making for young kids now, saying, will the jobs be there for me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Then I say, look back historically. America has a lot more people working here. And think about the amount of technology came in over the last 50 years, and we have twice as many people work in this country as we did 50 years ago, twice as many, and the population has only gone up by about a third. So think about that dynamic as it finds its way through. That's the glass half full part of it. But it will have an impact. I don't think it's impacting a lot right now, because many companies are just trying to learn how to use it. Technology has impacted, and AI gives it a place to go it hasn't gone so far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we're talking about all the unknowns and why it's kind of hard to model things right now. Well, Friday, the President fired, as you know, the head statistician that comes up with these jobs numbers and presents them to the public. The former head during the first Trump administration came out in her defense and said this is- this is without merit, and it undermines credibility of data. Are you concerned by this firing, and do you feel there is political pressure here?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think that's more politics. And I know I'm in Washington, DC, and that's what we're supposed to talk about--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Government data is, is\u2014",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: but the reality is, the data\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: hugely important modeling",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's 2025",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: as you know.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's 2025 and the data should be able to be\u2014 they use surveys and things like that, which, frankly, just aren't as effective anymore. So if you look at the rate of people who respond to their surveys, it's down from 60% level to 50% level. You know, we don't use surveys (unintelligible) we do. We watch what consumers really do. We watch what businesses really do. They can get this data, I think, other ways and I think that's where the focus ought to be. How do we get the data to be more resilient and more predictable and more understandable? Because what bounces around is restatements, and that was one of the largest restatements, going back five or seven years in the pandemic, five years in the pandemic, that creates doubt around it. And so I think the key is, let's get- let's spend some money. Let's bring the information together. Let's find where else in the government money is reported. We report millions and millions of data points to the government every day. The data is out there somewhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finally, back in January, you were at Davos, President Trump talked about Bank of America.",
      "TRUMP ON TAPE: Many conservatives complained that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America. This conservative- They don't take conservative business. And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to respond to the allegation that conservatives are not being allowed to do business with your bank?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender. That's not- the issue they're focused on is the regulators impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after the fact, look, that you banked x, and now after the fact, you're gonna say x didn't turn out to be what you thought. So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for our client.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there industries you're uncomfortable doing business with?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: No, we do business with really--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Guns, oil and gas, tobacco, all of it?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We do business with all those industries. Individual companies because of credit decision stuff, that's different. But the reality is, is that if they gave us clarity from the regulatory thing and avoid the second guessing, that would be helpful, and I think that's what the President was pointing out, if you listen to him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Brian Moynihan, thank you for giving us some insight into the data you are seeing. Face the Nation will be back in a moment. Stay with us."

      "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to New Mexico's Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. She joins us from Santa Fe. Governor, two out of five New Mexicans are on Medicaid. You've got a lot of rural hospitals. Have you figured out how to implement everything Dr. Oz just laid out?",
      "GOV. LUJAN GRISHAM: Absolutely not. There is no real way to implement this. It's more paperwork for everyone. It's more paperwork for federal government, for state governments, for county governments, for local hospitals, for independent providers. And you know what Americans really hate, Margaret? When you go to your primary care physician and you spend 20 minutes sitting at a chair, not even on the exam table, while they are inputting data into a computer. So this doesn't make any sense. We should be a society and a country that is connecting people to healthcare providers. I think the one thing that Dr. Oz represents that's a fair representation, is we should be healthier as Americans. All right. We need to be moving out of poverty. We need drug prices- we should talk about that, to come down. So go after insurance companies. Do manufacturing here. Make sure we can negotiate fair prices. Let states do that, because I guarantee you, we'll do a better job than the federal government. And lastly, get people early, easy access today, more than half, or about half, our small businesses don't even offer health care coverage. So you can get a job. but now what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well, you said, though- in your state, because as a governor, you're going to have to figure this out. You have reserve cash from some oil and gas revenues, as I understand it, that have been put aside. Doesn't that show it is possible for the federal government to shift more responsibility back to the states? That's the argument conservatives are making.",
      "GOV. LUJAN GRISHAM: They are and it's temporary. There is no way any state, including this one\u2014which, frankly, I am really proud of, we are in really good financial shape that takes planning and effort. You know, our job projections continue to be met and exceed, unlike the federal jobs report, which is going in the opposite direction. So I don't know where all these jobs are going to be in this anemic economy. I mean, it's so bad. The last time it was this bad, I was in college, and let me tell you, that was a very long time ago. And so yes, temporarily we can do that. But you can't do it over the long haul. The lost minimally to New Mexico over less than a decade is between 12 and $13 billion dollars and when, not if, rural hospitals and local providers close their doors. I can do this better than any other state. The last governor completely canceled behavioral health. Six years later, we are still reeling from trying to rebuild. We put a billion dollars into behavioral health just this last legislative session. It is not so easy to rebuild something out of nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the $50 billion Rural Health Care Fund under this Republican law is supposed to give people the\u2014 your\u2014states like yours, the ability to come and say, we need this extra cash. Are you going to have to ask for that?",
      "GOV. LUJAN GRISHAM: I'm going to ask for every dollar the federal government has put aside anywhere that benefits a New Mexican. So you got 50 billion. That's $1 billion for each state, if it was even. Do you know how much money it would take to shore up rural hospitals? More than a billion. And to put that in perspective\u2014let me do this, it's a billion just for behavioral health, it's a billion plus just to keep people's coverage, it's another billion for prescription drugs, it's a billion dollars for rural provider delivery investments, and that's only 50 hospitals. You have hundreds of hospitals. Hundreds. 400 rural hospitals across America that will shutter. So that's the number at it is. We are- how do we pick these rural hospitals? And if you pick a Southeastern rural hospital in New Mexico, what about the rural hospital in western New Mexico. Economies fail. People have to move away. You don't have any OBGYN care. That whole area collapses, and they are reducing rural health care delivery by about 134 billion. So the 50 billion is just to make someone somewhere feel like they recognize that this is a disaster. $900 billion out of Medicaid is catastrophic, straight up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we ran through a lot of material here. I have more questions for you, but very quickly\u2014can you tell me\u2014you deployed the National Guard to counter unrest in New Mexico. How is that different from what the president did in California?",
      "GOV. LUJAN GRISHAM: Well, they're not policing. They're doing the back end work so that trained community policing, and members of that training, right\u2014those local police officers, they're on the streets. What we have in this country is a shortage of police officers. What I have in New Mexico is a partnership. So they're doing all of the\u2014they answer all of the emergency calls. They handle all the traffic clearance when we've got a crash. And it is working, we're beginning to see more productive fentanyl drug dealing high end arrests than we did without the guard. And I'm really proud of that work. This is about partnering and leveraging, not about indiscriminately going after individuals who have not committed serious crimes.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that airs on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025. This interview was taped on Aug. 1, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by United States Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer. Ambassador, good to have you here.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Great to be here. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President signed this executive order on Thursday, raises tariff rates on about 70 countries. Should we expect those to be negotiated down in the coming days?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: I don't, I don't think they will be in the coming days. I think a lot of these, well I know a lot of these, are set rates pursuant to deals. Some of these deals are announced,\u00a0 some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country. So, so these, these tariff rates are pretty much set. I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the President's tariff plan right now with these rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was reading some interviews you had given, and you said at some point the President's view is maybe a tariff is better than a deal. Are you saying there are countries that just, they have no shot of avoiding a tariff?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Well, I would say that, in fact, most countries in the world, they just have a tariff assigned to them, right? Whether it's\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll be the 10 percent or 15 percent.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: 10 or 15 or the higher level tariff. Because, again, when the President is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do. And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this. And you know, sometimes a country will come back and make additional concessions that, that make it more appropriate. He's trying to get at the deficit. He's trying to reshore manufacturing. And so those are the factors he's looking at when he's looking at when he's determining whether he's just going to have a tariff or he'll take a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying to reshore manufacturing, bring manufacturing jobs back to America. But we just saw in this unemployment data that while the level is pretty low overall, it's pretty steady, good. Manufacturing in particular, we saw it contract for the fifth straight month in July, factory employment dropped to lowest levels in five years. What does that data indicate to you about the impact of your tariffs?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Yeah, I saw that and my own view is that I think a lot of companies were waiting to see if the tax bill was going to come through with the expensing for capital goods and things like that. And so I think now you know a lot of that data comes pre \"One Big Beautiful Bill\". Now that we have \"One Big Beautiful Bill\", and we have a better sense of where the taxes are going, I think we're going to see a much, we're going to see more investment, all the, all the commitments on investment we've seen countries making, that's going to come through. And like you said, it's a relatively small number. So I don't, I don't read tariff policy into that number. I think that is kind of pre-bill policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you believe the executives are making strategic decisions with hiring, but the President just announced that the head of Labor Statistics is being fired because of the weak jobs report, claiming the data was faked.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Well, I think you know, and I saw what the president did, and he also talked about the, just the record from BLS, you know, last year\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Labor Statistics Bureau.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: That's right, yeah, exactly. You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers and so it sounds to me like the President has real concerns. You know, not just based on today's but everything we saw last year. You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it's, you know, the President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you were just saying you weren't really doubting the data.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: No, I wasn't\u2013 You asked me what I thought about the data\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:",
      "Right.",
      "JAMIESON GREER:\u2013And was it reflected in the tariff policy? The answer is no. I mean, my view is, to the extent that there's some kind of, you know, information about manufacturing jobs, you know, I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the \"one big, beautiful bill\" passed, now that we have the expensing going in. And I think that, you know, our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident, though \u2013 because you have to deal in legal terms, in details, with facts and data when you are negotiating a legal agreement \u2013 do you trust that if you bring hard data to the president, he takes your counsel, even if it's an inconvenient fact?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Always, yes. I mean, I've spent the- I spend many hours with the president almost every day, and that's what we're talking about is data. We're looking - and I'm on the trade side, of course - and we're looking at import figures, export figures, investment levels, et cetera. And that's how we're making this decision. So I'm very comfortable with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've seen that Apple estimates, for the full year, tariffs are going to cost them more than a billion dollars. For the automakers - GM, Stellantis, Ford - they all came out and said they are going to take a hit from this.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, so that's exactly the issue, right? We have, over decades, we've had these large manufacturers, advanced manufacturing, that have gone overseas. They've gone to other countries. They've taken advantage of unfair trading practices, and the fact that the US has had low tariffs while other countries haven't, and they've taken advantage of that. That's what businesses do. We're all capitalists. And so if now they have to pay a tariff or build here, the President is creating incentives to bring them back here. That's why GM has announced investments here in the United States, and that's why we have all these companies and countries announcing investment in the US. Because the tariffs create the incentive to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But reductions in profits come at a cost, right? And as CEOs are making decisions, how long do you expect this pain to last for corporate America?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, you know, again, when we look at- you know, when we look at the numbers and the data, we're seeing predictions of more investment here. That's what we want. The President isn't doing this so much for the companies. He's doing it for American workers who have seen their jobs offshored to Mexico, to Vietnam, to China. So when we hear companies having to make hard choices about supply chain changes. We have to do that. I mean the status quo, where we keep making things overseas, because we can do it a little bit cheaper in the short run. That is not preferable to having that investment and employment here in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we haven't seen that reshoring happen.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, we have- we have announced AstraZeneca announced they're going to have a $50 billion investment in pharmaceuticals. GM has announced $5 billion. Hyundai Steel has said they're going to do a $21 billion investment in Louisiana. So this is- this is actually happening. These are things from the company saying it right, and they have to say it. And they have, you know, earnings reports, and they have and- they have filings. They can't just make this stuff up. This is real investment that we're seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Canada, which is our second largest- largest trading partner. The president increased tariffs to 35%. It applies, though, to just about 10% of what Canada sells here. Why bother to do this now in the middle of negotiations?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So I would say, first of all, you know, Canada is subject to 50% tariffs on steel, aluminum. 25% tariffs on autos, and again, the 35% tariff on- on goods that don't follow the rules of USMCA. And, you know, early on, the president posed a 25% tariff on Canada, and that was really about fentanyl and border issues, right? It's- it's- it's a separate regime from the reciprocal tariff. And what did Canada do in response? You know, they talked about helping at the border. And I'm not, you know, I'm not the drug czar or anything. But what I do know, as the trade guy, is that Canada retaliated. The only other country in the world who retaliated on tariffs was the Chinese. And so if the president's going to take an action and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness. So we have to go up too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about the things that the former Prime Minister Trudeau put in place, not the\u00a0 current Prime Minister--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- And are still in place--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That are still in place. But the current prime minister has held off, largely, on retaliation here. That's the guy you're negotiating with and his team. So what's the strategy here? And aren't you worried that this will hurt the broader free trade deal if you truly do want to renegotiate it next year.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well- well, the President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system. So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : So I hear you drawing distinctions when you say I'm the trade guy, I'm not the drug czar.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm the trade guy. I'm not handling these other things. But the President is kind of blending all these things together, because he cited fentanyl once again when it came to tariffs-\u00a0 to the policy with Canada. He also said on social media, Canada's decision to back statehood for Palestine is going to make it hard for us to make a trade deal. How does that have anything to do with financial and trade agreements?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, so- so, first of all, the president United States has his foreign affairs power where he can- he can manage relations under the Constitution with foreign countries. Second of all, you know, Congress delegated to the president the ability to take economic action in response to national emergencies in the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And for example, the Treasury Department, they have a number of sanctions where they can actually cut off a country's trade with the United States, prohibit goods, cut them off from our financial system for geopolitical reasons. So the fact that they can do that- almost certainly the President can do something that's not as expansive and just- and just put a fee on those goods, which is a- which is a tariff. So if you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But can and should are different things, right? And- and I'm asking this--",
      "JAMIESON GREER: --But to- to go- but- but listen, if you're going to sanction somebody and essentially prohibit trade, you almost certainly can do something that's softer, which is to allow the trade and just put a tariff on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Brazil, because the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil. That means, you know, we sell them more than we buy from them. So it doesn't seem to be consistent here, when you have the President put 50% tariffs on Brazil, one of the highest of any countries. And at the same time, the President is bringing up things that have nothing to do with trade when he's justifying them. He sent a letter to the current government complaining about the prosecution of his ally, Bolsonaro, who is- who allegedly staged a coup when he lost the last election. The President called it a witch hunt. This seems politically motivated and not about trade.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, two things. First of all, there's a 10% tariff on Brazil because we have a surplus with them. That's the reciprocal tariff. And then there's a 40% tariff that the President has chosen to do under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, like we would do any sanction where we see geopolitical issues. The President has seen in Brazil, like he's seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy, what one might call lawfare. It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues. I mean, sanctions, we've been using them for years with all kinds of countries, including countries we like--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You view tariffs and sanctions as the same?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: They're just different in degree. I mean, tariffs are actually lighter than a sanction- a sanction, you're cutting off a country from your financial system. You're prohibiting trade with them. A tariff, you're allowing trade. You're just putting a fee on it. It's a- it's a lesser",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: step than sanctions--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You- you have moved far away from from dealing with the deficit. Now--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: --Well the deficit has a 10% tariff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --you are talking about politically motivated trade actions here. I mean, the president sent a letter to President Lula, saying that tariffs are due in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on free elections. He also, at the same time, sanctioned the Supreme Court justice overseeing Bolsonaro's trial. Why are you trying to influence a criminal trial of an ally of President Trump?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, so, so the president of United States, historically, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, they have used IEEPA to impose sanctions for all kinds of geopolitical reasons in all kinds of countries. Sometimes it's countrywide, sometimes it's specific to certain, you know, individuals and often foreign leaders and foreign officials. So this is not, this is not way outside the market. If anything, the President could have gone farther in the type of sanction that was used. Instead he just used a tariff instead of cutting them off from the financial system altogether.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were fully on board with it. It sounds like.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: With the president of the United States? My boss? Of course I am--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But with intervening in criminal trials--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: --when the President--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- through trade policy.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: When the President sees lawfare going on, he's going to impose a sanction through IEEPA that's been delegated by Congress. That's his job as the president. He's elected to assess the Foreign Affairs situation in the United States and take appropriate action. There's just no question that it's both from a legal perspective, it's completely permissible. And from a policy perspective, that's what he's elected to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to trade, the big deal that is pending out there is how is the president going to deal with China? There's an August 12 deadline, and if that deadline is not met, you have said tariff levels could snap back to above 80%. Is that deadline going to slide?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So that's what's under discussion right now. I would say that our conversations with the Chinese have been very positive. We have discussions at the staff level, at my level, you know, President Xi and President Trump have had conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said that it's sliding. The Chinese said it's sliding.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: That's something we're working toward. That's what we talked about--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not there yet.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: And so, so they want to do that. We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it, you know, I think it's going in a positive direction. You know, I'm not going to get ahead of the President, but, you know, I don't think anyone wants to see those tariffs snap back to 84%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you get any commitments in those two days of talks in Stockholm?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So yes, we did. Yes, we talked about, and I won't go into detail, because they're, you know, confidential conversations between two, two governments, but they really focused on rare earth magnets and minerals. You've probably heard some about that, that China has put a global control on the world, and so for the United States, we're focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from from China to the United States and the- and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control, and I'd say we're about halfway there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time today.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back."

    "summary": "President Trump said he ordered his administration to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",
      "The July data appears to back up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's\u00a0most recent \"beige book,\" which compiles comments from local businesses, that many companies were delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant job report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "The immigration raids at the center of the legal battle triggered massive protests in the Los Angeles area in June, as well as widespread fears among the region's large Latino community.",
    "story": [
      "An appeals court late Friday mostly kept in place restrictions on \"roving\" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, agreeing with a lower court judge who found that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration in Southern California appeared to have been predicated on people's race and other factors, like speaking Spanish.",
      "A panel of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit largely denied a Trump administration request to suspend the lower court ruling, which required federal immigration officials to have reasonable suspicion that someone is in the country illegally before detaining them.",
      "The immigration raids at the center of the legal battle triggered massive protests in the Los Angeles area in June, as well as widespread fears among the region's large Latino community. While most demonstrations were peaceful, instances of violence led President Trump to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles with orders to protect federal buildings and the immigration agents enforcing his far-reaching crackdown on illegal immigration. Most of them have since been demobilized.",
      "Those high-profile immigration arrests in California have continued, led by Customs and Border Protection agents who have been assigned to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers with furthering the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign \u2014 in some cases, far away from the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Beyond requiring CBP and ICE to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone, the July order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong prohibited federal agents from basing arrests on people's race or ethnicity, the fact that they speak Spanish or have an accent, their presence in a location, or their occupation.",
      "Frimpong stated that any immigration arrests that relied exclusively on these factors violated the U.S. Constitution's 4th Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.",
      "\"We agree with the district court that, in the context of the Central District of California, the four enumerated factors at issue \u2014 apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together \u2014 describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop,'\" the 9th Circuit panel wrote in its opinion Friday.",
      "The panel was comprised of Circuit Judges Ronald M. Gould, Marsha S. Berzon, and Jennifer Sung, appointees of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Joe Biden.",
      "The cases cited in the lawsuit against the Los Angeles-area immigration sweeps involved arrests in June near a car wash, a tow yard and other locations where U.S. citizens were among those questioned about their legal status and detained by federal agents. Advocates have described the operations as \"roving patrols.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit did alter one part of Frimpong's ruling, removing an exception to her ban on using the four factors that include people's race and vocation when making arrests. The panel said that an \"except as permitted by law\" clause in her order was too vague.",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates hailed Friday's ruling, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration sweeps as indiscriminate raids that have instilled fear in the Los Angeles area.",
      "\"Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to live, work, and belong in their community without being hunted, harassed, or locked away,\" said Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a Los Angeles-based group that represents those facing deportation.",
      "The Trump administration has maintained in court that federal officials rely on intelligence packages and certain information \u2014 like \"past experiences\" that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally frequent or work at certain locations \u2014 when carrying out immigration enforcement operations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Saturday, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that \"unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people.\"",
      "\"What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S.\u2014NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,\" she said. \"America's brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists\u2014truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities.  70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges. President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem are putting the American people first by removing illegal aliens who pose a threat to our communities. Law and order will prevail.\"",

      "The fundraiser for the pro-Trump super political action committee MAGA Inc. aims to raise about $25 million, one of the sources said.",
      "One day prior to the event, Mr. Trump sent letters to pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, demanding they lower U.S. drug prices to more evenly match what other countries pay.",
      "The White House's letters to 17 drug companies, including AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, asked for commitments within 60 days to sell drugs for Medicaid patients and all new drugs at \"most favored nation\" rates. The president posted images of the letters to Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order in May telling federal officials to draw up \"most favored nation\" regulations unless pharmaceutical companies made progress toward cutting prices. This week's letters \u2014 which were addressed to Bourla and the other CEOs \u2014 accused the drugmakers of promising \"more of the same\" since then.",
      "The president said Friday he's \"gone to war with the drug companies and, frankly, other countries\" on the drug price issue.",
      "\"I think we're going to be very successful fairly soon. We'll have drug prices coming down by 500, 600 800 even 1,200 percent,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with Newsmax on Friday afternoon.",
      "The high cost of prescription drugs has vexed both parties for decades. Proposals to tie drug prices for U.S. patients to the typically much-lower rates charged in other developed countries have floated around for years, but the idea has faced some legal pushback.",
      "Meanwhile, drugmakers argue price caps could discourage innovation by making it harder to pay for research and development for new drugs. The industry also argues that Americans tend to have access to more groundbreaking drugs than residents of foreign countries with stricter price regulations \u2014 and says high drug prices are just one part of a broader trend of higher healthcare spending in the U.S.",
      "Bourla has engaged with Mr. Trump in the past. Pfizer was one of the drugmakers that was picked to rapidly develop COVID-19 vaccines in the first Trump administration's \"Operation Warp Speed.\" And two weeks before Mr. Trump's second inauguration, Bourla and other Pfizer executives traveled to Mar-A-Lago for meetings, the Financial Times has previously reported.",

      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",

      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from rapidly deporting migrants who entered the U.S. legally on humanitarian grounds, potentially curtailing arrests at immigration courts that have triggered controversy across the country.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb of Washington, D.C., barred federal immigration officials from using two Trump administration directives to apply a fast-track deportation process known as expedited removal on migrants who were granted immigration parole to enter the U.S. at an official port of entry. Parole is an immigration authority that allows federal officials to admit foreigners on humanitarian grounds, and lets them live and work in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis.",
      "If left in place, Cobb's ruling could significantly hinder the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to ramp up its mass deportation campaign by targeting migrants allowed into the U.S. under the Biden administration through the parole authority. The Justice Department is expected to appeal her order.",
      "One operation in particular that could be curtailed by Cobb's ruling is a Trump administration effort to convince immigration judges to dismiss the court cases of certain migrants, so that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can arrest them after their hearings and place them in expedited removal.",
      "Unlike immigration court cases, which typically take years to complete due to a backlog of millions of unresolved claims, expedited removal allows officials to more quickly deport migrants who arrived to the U.S. in the past two years. Those placed in that process face summary deportation from the U.S. unless they express concerns of being persecuted in their home countries and prove to an asylum officer that their fear is credible.",
      "The courthouse arrests have been reported in cities across the U.S., with videos emerging showing ICE officials detaining migrants immediately after their hearings conclude. In some cases, those taken into custody have been seen weeping and visibly distraught. The practice has been strongly decried by Democratic lawmakers and advocates, who say it punishes people who are trying to follow the legal process by showing up to their hearings.",
      "In her opinion, Cobb found the Trump administration's efforts to be illegal, saying the lawsuit against the expedited deportations raised a \"question of fair play.\" She noted the plaintiffs in the case, two migrants from Cuba and Venezuela, had \"played by the rules,\" entered the country with the government's permission and attended their court hearings \u2014 and were nonetheless targeted for expedited deportation.",
      "\"This case's underlying question, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,\" Cobb wrote. \"Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that \u2014 as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers \u2014 may look to them more and more like the countries from which they tried to escape?\"",
      "Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert in U.S. immigration law, said Cobb's order could mean that \"several hundred thousand people will be temporarily spared from immediate removal under the expedited removal procedures.\"",
      "Yale-Loehr noted the ruling is a reprieve for many of the more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who were allowed into the U.S. through the parole authority, under a Biden administration sponsorship policy. It also protects some of the nearly 1 million migrants paroled into the U.S. along the southern border under another Biden-era policy powered by a now-discontinued phone app known as CBP One.",
      "In a statement, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin denounced Friday's order.",

While the storm that day had previously been analyzed by scientists, new satellite technology recently documented the megaflash exceeding 500 miles.",

      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",

    "summary": "The arrival of Crew 11 clears the way for four other station fliers to return to Earth next week after a 145-day stay in space.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule homed in on the International Space Station early Saturday and glided in for a problem-free docking \u2014 delivering two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and a Japanese flier \u2014 to the outpost after a 16-hour rendezvous.",
      "Catching up from behind and below, the Crew 11 Dragon Endeavour looped up ahead of the lab complex, then to a point directly above the outpost before slowly moving straight in for a linkup at the space-facing port of the forward Harmony module at 2:27 a.m. ET as the two spacecraft orbited 264 miles above the south Pacific Ocean.",
      "Hooks and latches then engaged, pulling the Crew Dragon's nose firmly into the docking mechanism, which locked the craft in place. Umbilicals automatically connected and flight controllers began a series of leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal.",
      "\"Endeavour, welcome to the International Space Station,\" called NASA astronaut Jonny Kim from inside the ISS. \"Zena, Mike, Kimi and Oleg, we have cold drinks, hot food and hugs waiting. See you soon.\"",
      "\"Hello space station, Crew 11 is here!\" Endeavour pilot Mike Fincke, a three-flight veteran, enthusiastically replied. \"And we are super excited to join Expedition 73. We will do our best to also be good stewards of our beautiful ISS during our stay. The ISS has been inhabited and crewed for almost 25 years. We look forward to celebrating with you.\"",
      "Nearly three hours later, after doffing their spacesuits and configuring their capsule for docked operations, Fincke, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, Japanese veteran Kimiya Yui and rookie cosmonaut Oleg Platonov floated through the forward hatch to be welcomed aboard by the space station's seven-member crew.",
      "\"We are so happy to see your smiling faces,\" said ISS commander Takuya Onishi. \"Zena, Oleg, congratulations on your first spaceflight. We are looking forward to hearing your impressions and your feelings about that. Mike and Kimiya, welcome back. Your experience will be an invaluable asset for Expedition 73.\"",
      "Cardman was bumped from a Crew Dragon flight last year to help NASA bring two Starliner astronauts back to Earth after problems prevented them from coming home on their own spacecraft. She was clearly thrilled to finally be aboard the space station.",
      "\"This has been the absolute journey of a lifetime,\" she said with a broad smile. \"We are so incredibly grateful to be here. Thank you so much for this warm welcome. It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time, especially with these wonderful crewmates.\"",
      "With the arrival of Crew 11, four of the station's crew members \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 will be clear to undock and return to Earth next Wednesday to close out a 145-day mission.",
      "The other three \u2014 Kim and Soyuz MS-27/73S crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky \u2014 will remain aboard with Cardman and company to continue Expedition 73.",
      "Until now, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit with Crew 11.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25% while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money.",
      "No final decisions have been made. But NASA is assessing the possibility of extending Crew 11's stay in space from six to eight months, depending on the actual funding outlook.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" Cardman said before launch. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

    "story": [
      "Running a day late, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Friday on a mission to deliver a fresh three-man one-woman crew to the International Space Station.",
      "The Falcon 9 lifted off at 11:43 a.m. EDT from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as mission control kept a close eye on clouds rolling into the area shortly before launch time.",
      "With commander Zena Cardman and co-pilot Mike Fincke monitoring cockpit displays, flanked on the left by Japanese Astronaut Kimiya Yui and on the right by cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, the Crew Dragon capsule began its climb. Nine minutes later, they reached orbit and set off after the International Space Station.",
      "\"I have no emotions but joy right now. That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime,\" radioed Cardman, making her first flight. \"Thank you, this has been an incredible honor.\"",
      "Added Fincke, a three-flight veteran: \"Boy, it's great to be back in orbit again! Thank you to SpaceX and NASA to get us here. What a ride!\"",
      "The crew\u00a0originally hoped to take off Thursday, but clouds built up over the launch site and SpaceX called off the countdown just 67 seconds before liftoff. Weather remained a concern the second time around, but in the end conditions were \"go\" for launch.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9's first stage engines shut down, the stage dropped away and the flight to orbit continued on the power of the single Merlin engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around and reversed course, flying itself back to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, chalking up SpaceX's 65th Florida landing and its 484th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "One minute after landing, the second stage engine shut down and the Crew Dragon Endeavour was released to fly on its own.",
      "Had the crew launched Thursday, it would have taken them nearly 40 hours to catch up with the space station. With a launch Friday, the trip was expected to take just 16 hours, setting up a docking at the forward Harmony module's space-facing port at 3 a.m. Saturday \u2014 the same time they would have docked had they launched Thursday.",
      "For Cardman, the trip to space finally fulfills a dream she had hoped to accomplish last year when she came within a month or so of launching to the space station as commander of an earlier Crew Dragon flight.",
      "But she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex in June 2024 in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "Wilson has not yet been assigned another flight, but Cardman was tapped to command of Crew 11.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" she said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Fincke is a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "Platonov, making his first flight, was assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program. The arrangement is intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it.",
      "Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under the agreement.",
      "A long-awaited mission aboard the space station",
      "Crew 11 will be welcomed aboard the space station by by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand: Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Clothing and personal items for Cardman are already on board, launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, her 38th, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "NASA plans to retire the space station in 2030, using a custom spacecraft being designed by SpaceX to drive the 930,000-pound football-field-size lab out of orbit, making sure it breaks up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from any populated areas.",
      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",
      "Said departing Crew 10 commander McClain: \"We feel very safe.\"",

The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

Instead, Governor Abbott and Republican leadership used the tragedy as political cover,\" Texas House Democrats said in a statement Sunday.",
      "\"... Governor Abbott has turned the victims of a tragedy into political hostages in his submission to Donald Trump. We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander. As of today, this corrupt special session is over,\" the statement said.",

      "\"For any member who fails to do so, I will invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House,\" Abbott said in a statement.",
      "\"The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation\u2014not to prevent votes that may not go their way,\" Abbott wrote. \"Every session, legislators\u00a0on both sides of the aisle\u00a0find themselves on the losing side of a legislative vote. And every session, most of those legislators find a way to disagree agreeably and behave like adults, rather than going AWOL.\"",
      "Republicans unveiled the new maps\u00a0last week as part of a mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to protect the GOP's razor-thin U.S. House majority. President Trump said in July that he believes Republicans could win five more seats in Texas with different districts.",
      "Abbott included redistricting to be addressed in a special legislative session, along with other high-profile topics like approving disaster relief for the deadly Texas floods and a THC ban.",
      "\"For weeks, we've been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown \u2014 if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown \u2014 then we'd give them that showdown,\" Martin said.",
      "Both houses of the Texas legislature are controlled by Republicans, but if most Democratic lawmakers leave the state, they could deny the state House and Senate the two-thirds quorum that they need to vote on the new congressional maps.",
      "At least 51 Texas Democrats have fled the state for Chicago. Politico was first to report the lawmakers had left the state.",
      "\"We're not here to have fun. We're not here because this is easy, and we did make a decision to come here today \u2014 we did not make a decision lightly,\" Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu said after arriving in Illinois. \"But we come here today with absolute moral clarity that this is absolutely the right thing to do to protect the people of the state of Texas.\"",
      "Republicans in Texas currently hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats. The party hopes the new maps could bring that number up to 30, and all of those new 30 seats were won by Mr. Trump in November by at least 10 points.",
      "The five seats come from redrawing Rio Grande Valley districts \u2014 where Mr. Trump has made gains in what were once Democratic strongholds \u2014 and combining Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Greg Cesar's districts in Austin. In North Texas, Rep. Julie Johnson's suburban 32nd District would be reshaped to stretch from the Dallas area to rural Republican strongholds, and Rep. Marc Veasey would be moved out of Tarrant County entirely, which would leave only a small portion of the county represented by a Democrat. All four Houston-area seats were redrawn, with Rep. Al Green's being the most dramatic.",
      "\"They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 election,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico said in a message\u00a0posted to social media. \"If this power grab succeeds, they will hang on to power without any accountability from the voters.\"",
      "Wu said Texas Republicans are \"using is a racist, gerrymandered map, a map that seeks to use racial lines to divide hard working communities who have spent decades building up their power and strengthening their voices, and Governor Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump.\"",
      "Democrats have fought back against the new districts, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries traveling to Austin on Thursday to pledge national support.",
      "\"We are not fighting for the Democratic Party, we are fighting for the democratic process, and the stakes could not be higher. We have to take a stand,\" Talarico added.",
      "Martin said in an appearance Sunday on MSNBC, \"I'm proud of the Texas Dems for actually breaking quorum here. Our democracy is literally under assault by Donald Trump, Greg Abbott and the Republicans, who know that they are on a track to lose the House majority next year. So what do they do? They cheat. They rigged the system. That's all they have left.\"",
      "\"We're certainly going to be standing with folks who will be litigating this in the courts,\" Martin added. \"We will continue to organize on the ground in Texas, and we will continue to support the House Dems, as they have broke quorum right now.\"",
      "This is not the first time Democrats have left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 and not the first time they have done it to protest redistricting. During the landmark 2005 mid-decade redistricting, Texas Democrats fled during two separate special sessions to stop the redistricting. But the redistricting eventually did go through. And in 2023, Republicans passed legislation that levies a $500-a-day fine on lawmakers who leave the state.",
      "The last significant quorum break in the Texas House was in 2021, when Democrats fled the state to prevent a restrictive voting bill from passing.",

      "Loni Anderson, who played a struggling radio station's empowered receptionist on the hit TV comedy \"WKRP in Cincinnati,\" died Sunday, just days before her 80th birthday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Anderson died at a Los Angeles hospital following a \"prolonged\" illness, said her longtime publicist, Cheryl J. Kagan.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our dear wife, mother and grandmother,\" Anderson's family said in a statement.",
      "\"WKRP in Cincinnati\" aired on CBS from 1978-1982 and was set in a flagging Ohio radio station trying to reinvent itself with rock music. The cast included Gary Sandy, Tim Reid, Howard Hesseman, Frank Bonner and Jan Smithers, alongside Anderson as the sexy and smart Jennifer Marlowe.",
      "As the station's receptionist, the blonde and high-heeled Jennifer used her sex appeal to deflect unwanted business calls for her boss, Mr. Carlson. Her efficiency often kept the station running in the face of others' incompetence.",
      "The role earned Anderson two Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe nominations.",
      "Anderson starred on the big screen alongside Burt Reynolds in the 1983 comedy \"Stroker Ace,\" and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before divorcing in 1994.",
      "Anderson wrote a 1995 autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels,\" which she said was about \"the growth of a woman, a woman who survives. It's about my childhood, the death of my parents, my career, my divorces, and my children. Then of course, the trauma of my marriage to Burt.\"",
      "\"I think if you're going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,\" Anderson told The Associated Press. \"You may not even tell the nicest things about yourself, because you're telling the truth.\"",
      "Anderson is survived by her husband Bob Flick, daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and wife Helene, step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.",

      "In a whirlwind of negotiations over three days, Democrats asked for multiple billions in government funds to be released in exchange for a vote on a batch of nominees President Trump wanted confirmed before lawmakers left for their August break, sources told CBS News.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was negotiating with GOP leadership for $5 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $1 billion for the Global Fund, $300 million for the World Food Program, $50 million to fight HIV in developing countries, about $140 million for the United Nations Children's Fund, and other money funding that had been previously approved, sources said.",

      "Some of the negotiations were about Republicans not withholding funds Congress has already agreed to. Schumer wanted no clawbacks, including so-called pocket rescissions, two of the sources said, referring to presidential funding cut proposals to Congress that are very late in the fiscal year.",
      "As of now, about 140 Trump nominees await a vote, including some 30 ambassadors. Among those are Mike Waltz, who is awaiting a confirmation vote as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, nominated for U.S. ambassador to Greece.",
      "Those who were confirmed Saturday include Defense Department officials Earl Matthews and Adam Telle; trade official Will Kimmitt; judicial officials Jeanine Pirro and Jason Quinones; and ambassadors Andrew Puzder for the European Union and Brian Burch for the Vatican. Also confirmed was Senate Majority Leader John Thune's son-in-law, Luke Lindberg, for an undersecretary post at the Agriculture Department.",

      "The remaining administration officials Mr. Trump was hoping to get installed will have to wait until at least September. Thune said the Senate will adjourn until Sept. 2.",
      "\"We were serious about trying to make some progress,\" Schumer told reporters at a news conference Saturday. \"But ultimately, Trump wouldn't agree. He took his ball, he went home \u2014 leaving Democrats and Republicans alike wondering, \"What the hell happened?\"",
      "Pressed on whether he had asked the White House to unfreeze some aid for Palestinians, Schumer said: \"I'm not going to get into the details. Obviously, we'd all like to help Gaza, but the bottom line is, we were getting close on a whole lot of issues, and Donald Trump just pulled the rug out from under people. And even before that, when it looked like we were getting close, a day before, he again called in and screwed it all up.\"",
      "Mr. Trump got his response in even before Schumer began his press conference, posting a message to the senator on Truth Social that read: \"GO TO HELL!\"",
      "\"Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country.

    "story": [
      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",
      "As for the economic impact that tariffs will have on the economy, Moynihan said \"no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.\"",

Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said, and left military service at the rank of sergeant.",

      "\"He was somebody that needed some serious resources. He had some mental health issues as well as PTSD from being in the military,\" Kristian Kelley said. \"I've never known him to be violent. He was a person who would tell pretty strange stories and different things like that.\"",

      "\"We're putting $50 billion. The president wants this, the Congress wants this,\" Oz said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" into law last month, which included a number of his second-term priorities from tax cuts to increased spending on border security, defense and energy production. The legislation was paid for in part by significant cuts to health care programs, like Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans.",
      "Among the cuts to Medicaid, the new law will lower provider taxes, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs. Lawmakers sought to supplement the cuts with a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals.",
      "Oz said the applications for the fund will start going out in early September. He said the money is designed to help with \"workforce development, right-sizing the system and using technology to provide things like telehealth that can change the world.\"",
      "\"Imagine if we can change the way we think about the delivery of health and make it more about getting people healthy who can thrive and flourish and be fully present in their own lives and as Americans,\" Oz said.",
      "The new law will also make changes to Medicaid work requirements for some able-bodied adults, along with more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would result in 10 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "Oz touted the work requirements, saying \"every Democratic president and Republican president has said that the foundation of a healthy welfare system, a social system of support, is work.\"",
      "He outlined that the requirements can also be met through community engagement, education and in caretaking roles, and that the administration began pursuing pilot programs when the bill was signed to demonstrate how technology can support the changes. But Brennan noted that according to KFF Health Policy, 92% of adult Medicaid recipients already are working or are caregivers or qualify for other exceptions. Oz said \"they're fine.\"",
      "\"We want to help connect you to the job market and get you into work,\" Oz said of people who are considered able-bodied. \"The goal of health care insurance is to catalyze action in the right direction, to get you healthier, to give you agency over the future, so you recognize you matter, and you should have a job, therefore, to go out and change the world.\"",

      "Victor Salgado said he decided on Election night last year he'd prepare to leave his job as an attorney in the Public Integrity division of the Justice Department.",
      "He soon began pursuing the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia. His campaign and his effort won just about 5% of the vote in the June primary.That was not enough to advance to the November general election,but he still did better than he had\u00a0 expected.",
      "Salgado told CBS News he decided to leave before the expected shakeup inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"I was just reading tea leaves on the type of people that had been close to Mr. Trump, and the people who would eventually come to run the Department of Justice,\" he said. \"I handicapped it at 90% that within the near future of January 20, the Public Integrity section will be dismantled.\"",
      "There were a series of ousters in the agency's public integrity section within the first two months of the Trump administration.",
      "Salgado enjoyed a storied career at the Justice Department, including an agency award for his work on a major cryptocurrency investigation, which led to a CEO's guilty plea in 2023. The department also credited Salgado with \"substantial contributions\" to the successful prosecution of former Rep. George Santos, a New York Republican who was expelled from Congress, pleaded guilty to fraud and began serving a prison sentence last month.",
      "Salgado said he emphasized his Justice Department work during his brief campaign, and as he met with voters and made campaign stops, he referenced the controversies involving the Trump's administration's use of law enforcement in immigration enforcement.",
      "He said the role of political candidate is challenging for career prosecutors.",
      "\"We are not partisan, especially as corruption prosecutors,\" he said. \"Of course, we have political opinions, but all of those get checked at the door.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Sunday that \"we're prepared to stick around and do the work needed\" despite having left Washington without a new trade deal amid increased tariffs from President Trump.",
      "\"We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together,\" LeBlanc said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The White House announced last week that duties would jump from 25% to 35% on Canadian goods not covered under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, claiming that the U.S.' second-largest trading partner hasn't done enough to address immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. LeBlanc said that while \"we were obviously disappointed by that decision,\" negotiators would \"continue to do the work.\"",
      "LeBlanc said his team left with \"a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship\" and characterizing the meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as \"constructive, cordial conversations.\"",
      "\"We're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies,\" LeBlanc said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners late last week. But Canada is the largest American trading partner included, being the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to\u00a0Census Bureau\u00a0data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "In an interview for \"Face the Nation\" on Friday, Greer cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs imposed earlier this year under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the increase, saying, \"if the president's going to take an action and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness, so we have to go up too.\"",
      "\"Our view is the president is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it,\" Greer said. \"And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.\"",
      "In a statement released Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions. He noted that \"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes.\"",
      "On Sunday, LeBlanc said he expects Carney will have a conversation with Mr. Trump \"over the next number of days,\" while noting that the Canadian prime minister has \"built a very business-like, respectful relationship with President Trump.\"",
      "\"We understand and respect totally the president's view in terms of the national security interests. In fact, we share it,\" LeBlanc said. \"And what we've said to our American counterparts is, how can we structure the right agreement where we can both continue to supply one another in a reliable, cost effective way that preserves jobs essential to the American economy? But the same thing is true, obviously in Canada as well.\"",
      "The U.S.-Canada relationship has been strained since Mr. Trump came into office in January and repeatedly suggested that Canada could become the \"51st state.\" Carney emphatically denied this in an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump in May, saying Canada is \"not for sale.\"",

      "(Begin VT)",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER (U.S. Trade Representative): I don't \u2013 I don't think they will be in the coming days.",
      "I think a lot of these \u2013 well, I know a lot of these, are set rates, pursuant to deals. Some of these deals are announced. Some are not. Others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country.",
      "So \u2013 so these \u2013 these tariff rates are pretty much set.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, at some point, the president's view is maybe a tariff is better than a deal.",
      "Are you saying there are countries that just they have no shot of avoiding a tariff?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Most countries in the world, they just have a tariff assigned to them, right, whether it's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll be the 10 percent or 15 percent.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 10 or 15 or the higher-level tariff, because, again, when the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals.",
      "And we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do. And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then, talking to his advisers, he makes a call on this.",
      "And, you know, sometimes, a country will come back and make additional concessions that \u2013 that make it more appropriate. He's trying to get at the deficit. He's trying to reshore manufacturing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying to reshore manufacturing, bring manufacturing jobs back to America.",
      "But we just saw in this unemployment data that, while the level is pretty low overall, it's pretty steady and good, manufacturing, in particular, we saw it contract for the fifth straight month in July. Factory employment dropped to lowest levels in five years. What does that data indicate to you about the impact of your tariffs?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I think a lot of companies were waiting to see if the tax bill was going to come through with the expensing for capital goods and things like that.",
      "And so I think now you know a lot of that data comes pre-One Big Beautiful Bill. Now that we have One Big Beautiful Bill, and we have a better sense of where the taxes are going. I think we're going to see a much \u2013 we're going to see more investment. All the \u2013 all the commitments on investment we've seen countries making, that's going to come through.",
      "So I don't \u2013 I don't read tariff policy into that number. I think that is kind of pre-bill policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president just announced that the head of labor statistics is being fired because of the weak jobs report, claiming the data was faked.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers. And so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns, you know, not just based on today's, but everything we saw last year.",
      "You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but, sometimes, you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it's \u2013 you know, the president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Canada, which is our second largest \u2013 largest trading partner.",
      "The president increased tariffs to 35 percent. It applies, though, to just about 10 percent of what Canada sells here. Why bother to do this now in the middle of negotiations?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So \u2013 so, I would say, first of all, early on, the president imposed a 25 percent tariff on Canada, and that was really about fentanyl and border issues, right? It's \u2013 it's a separate regime from the reciprocal tariff.",
      "And what did Canada do in response? You know, they talked about helping at the border. And I'm not \u2013 you know, I'm not a \u2013 the drug czar or anything. But what I do know, as the trade guy, is that Canada retaliated. The only other country in the world who retaliated on tariffs was the Chinese.",
      "And so if the president's going to take an action, and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness, so we have to go up too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about the things that the former Prime Minister Trudeau put in place, not the current prime minister?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And are \u2013 and are still in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are still in place.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the current prime minister has held off largely on retaliation here. That's the guy you're negotiating with and his team. So what's the strategy here? And aren't you worried that this will hurt the broader free trade deal if you truly do want to renegotiate it next year?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is, the president is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada. And if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I hear you drawing distinctions when you say, I'm the trade guy. I'm not the drug czar.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm the trade guy. I'm not handling these other things.",
      "But the president is kind of blending all these things together, because he cited fentanyl once again when it came to tariff \u2013 to the policy with Canada. He also said on social media: \"Canada's decision to back statehood for Palestine is going to make it hard for us to make a trade deal.\"",
      "How does that have anything to do with financial and trade agreements?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president of the United States has his foreign affairs power where he can \u2013 he can manage relations under the Constitution with foreign countries.",
      "Congress delegated to the president the ability to take economic action in response to national emergencies in the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And, for example, the Treasury Department, they have a number of sanctions where they can actually cut off a country's trade with the United States, prohibit goods, cut them off from our financial system for geopolitical reasons.",
      "So the fact that they can do that, almost certainly the president can do something that's not as expansive and just \u2013 and just put a fee on those goods, which is a \u2013 which is a tariff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Brazil, because the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil. That means, you know, we sell them more than we buy from them.",
      "So it doesn't seem to be consistent here, when you have the president put 50 percent tariffs on Brazil, one of the highest of any countries. And at the same time, the president is bringing up things that have nothing to do with trade when he's justifying them.",
      "He sent a letter to the current government complaining about the prosecution of his ally Bolsonaro, who is \u2013 who allegedly staged a coup when he lost the last election. The president called it a witch-hunt. This seems politically motivated and not about trade.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: There's a 10 percent tariff on Brazil because we have a surplus with them. That's the reciprocal tariff. And then there's a 40 percent tariff that the president has chosen to do under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 like we would do any sanction where we see geopolitical issues.",
      "The president has seen, in Brazil, like he's seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy, what one might call lawfare. It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues.",
      "I mean, sanctions, we've been using them for years with all kinds of countries, including countries we like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You view tariffs and sanctions as the same?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: They're just different in degree. I mean, tariffs are actually lighter than a sanction. A sanction, you're cutting off a country from your financial system. You're prohibiting trade with them. A tariff, you're allowing trade. You're just putting a fee on it. It's a \u2013 it's a lesser step than sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now you have moved \u2013 you have moved far away from dealing with the deficit.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the deficit has a 10 percent tariff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now you are talking about politically motivated trade actions here.",
      "I mean, the president sent a letter to President Lula saying the tariffs are due in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on free elections. Why are you trying to influence a criminal trial of an ally of President Trump?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president of United States, historically, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, they have used IEEPA to impose sanctions for all kinds of geopolitical reasons in all kinds of countries. Sometimes, it's countrywide. Sometimes, it's specific to certain, you know, individuals, and often foreign leaders and foreign officials.",
      "So this is not \u2013 this is not way outside the market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to trade, the big deal that is pending out there is, how is the president going to deal with China? There's an August 12 deadline. And if that deadline is not met, you have said tariff levels could snap back to above 80 percent.",
      "Is that deadline going to slide?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that's what's under discussion right now. I would say that our conversations with the Chinese have been very positive. We have discussions at the staff level, at my level. You know, President Xi and President Trump have had conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said that it's sliding. The Chinese said it's sliding.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's something we're working toward. That's what we talked about. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not there yet?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And so \u2013 so they want to do that. We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it.",
      "You know, I think it's going in a positive direction. You know, I'm not going to get ahead of the president. But, you know, I don't think anyone wants to see those tariffs snap back to 84 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you get any commitments in those two days of talks in Stockholm?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, yes, we did. Yes, we talked about \u2013 and I won't go into detail, because they're, you know, confidential conversations between two \u2013 two governments, but they really focused on rare earth magnets and minerals.",
      "China has put a global control on the world. And so for the United States, we're focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from China to the United States and the \u2013 and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control. And I would say we're about halfway there.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find our full interview with Ambassador Greer on our Web site, FacetheNation.com, and our YouTube page.",
      "We will be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "Good morning, and thank you for being here with us.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN (CEO, Bank of America): It's good to be here again, Margaret. Hope you're doing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm hoping you can give us some clarity here on what's going on with the economy.",
      "Your Bank of America economists say no rate hikes this year and no recession. Is that still the case after Friday's jobs report?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, it's still the case. And that's a \u2013 less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.",
      "And \u2013 but they still think we continue to grow. And we're growing at a slow rate, say 1.5 percent this year, a little more next year, and a little more the year after that. But it will take inflation \u2013 for the Fed to get inflation out of the system really through the end of '26 into '27, down to the 2 percent level.",
      "And that's why they have the Fed holding. What they believe is, sort of in the middle of next year, the Fed will start cutting and bring the Fed funds rate closer to what would be a more normal rate, around 3 percent, 3.5 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, even though we saw this really kind of astounding dissent by two members of the Fed\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 saying, we do need to move on interest rates, your prediction from your economists is that that's not appropriate at this time?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They don't think it's \u2013 they're going to move. Now, the market says they're going to move in September, maybe twice this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The market was at seven times one point this year. Now they're down to two. Then they're down to one. Now they're up to two.",
      "This is going to move around, but the reality is, two things people should really keep in focus. One is, until the inflation is out of the system, the Fed is going to be a little \u2013 very careful. And that's what they said. And then, secondly, the rate we're going to go to is a rate that is more normal than pre-global financial crisis, more of a 3 percent, 3.5 percent rate, which actually means the American economy is probably functioning better, frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on that point, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" we were reading in, puts the tariff tax increase as costing $360 billion a year. That's one of the largest tax increases in history, they say.",
      "Do you believe the administration's arguments that it's really only foreigners who are going to pay the cost of this? Do you think economists are overstating the negative impact?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.",
      "And there's \u2013 so they're trying to extrapolate from things from 50 years ago, when economies were a different structure. Our team thinks it's \u2013 has an impact on inflation of about, you know, 30, 40 basis points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning adding to prices people are paying.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, adding to the inflation rate in the United States.",
      "But we need to back up. What the real impact right now is the new Trump administration coming in had four or five policy areas they were really going to go after, having learned in the four years they had to move very quickly. Those were around trades and tariff, immigration and taxation and deregulation.",
      "What businesses \u2013 and I just was in the Midwest with a bunch of businesses \u2013 they're all trying to do is figure out what the answer will be so they can go ahead and make their plans for '26. So the activity that's slowed down has more to do with people just trying to figure out the answer. It doesn't mean every answer is acceptable, but most answers are.",
      "So what do they have answers on? Obviously, the tax bill getting done. That's a good answer for business, because it makes the rates permanent. What's the second thing they have an answer on? They have an answer now on the range of trade possibilities. And so, as they think about the trade possibilities, they sit there and say, tariffs might not be worse than X. They see some deals getting done, all of which is good work.",
      "What they don't have an answer on is deregulation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, new regulations have stopped, but they are hoping for more deregulation, so that will help their business models going forward.",
      "And then the last is immigration. What will immigration really settle in like? And that's what they tell us. So they're not using their lines of credit. They're not \u2013 the indications from them are, they're being a little more cautious, really waiting for some answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Businesses aren't hiring either, we saw in this jobs data on Friday. It was the worst three months for job growth since the pandemic.",
      "Your firm, when I was reading the analysis, points to a number of different factors, and one of them is artificial intelligence and the adoption of that impacting hiring. How dramatically is it reshaping the job market?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think this is sort of a question of almost a glass half-full/half-empty type of thing. So the impact\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No pun intended.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, exactly.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Sorry about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: But the impact of technology on human work content as a percentage of productivity has been huge.",
      "In our company, at \u2013 in 2010, when I started with the management team, we had 285,000 people. We have 212,000 people today. That was the impact of technology. We're bigger, more customers, more transactions, more reports to the government, more data, et cetera.",
      "So the impact has always been huge. A.I. gives you a place to go that we've never been able to go before. In other words, they're jobs that take text, think about it, and produce it, many, many jobs in our company, our research team. Now you're able to maybe use a machine to enhance that activity.",
      "So we believe that people who harness A.I. for their benefit are going to be very successful. The \u2013 my teammates who harness A.I. for their benefit are very successful. It's nervous-making for young kids now, saying, will the jobs be there for me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Then I say, look back historically. America has a lot more people working here. And think about the amount of technology that came in over the last 50 years, and we have twice as many people working in this country as we did 50 years ago, twice as many.",
      "And the population has only gone up by about a third. So think about that dynamic as it finds its way through. That's the glass-half-full part of it. But it will have an impact. I don't think it's impacting a lot right now, because many companies are just trying to learn how to use it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Technology is impacted, and A.I. gives it a place to go it hasn't gone so far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we're talking about all the unknowns and why it's kind of hard to model things right now.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Exactly, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Friday, the president fired, as you know, the head statistician that comes up with these jobs numbers and presents them to the public.",
      "The former head during the first Trump administration came out in her defense\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and said, this is \u2013 this is without merit, and it undermines credibility of data.",
      "Are you concerned by this firing? And do you feel there is political pressure here?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think that's more politics. And I know I'm in Washington, D.C., and that's what we're supposed to talk about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Government data is \u2013 is\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: But the reality \u2013 the reality is, the data\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 hugely important to modeling, as you know.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's 2025. It's 2025. And the data should be able to be \u2013 they use surveys and things like that, which, frankly, just aren't as effective anymore.",
      "So, if you look at the rate of people who respond to their surveys, it's down from 60 percent level to 50 percent level. You know, we don't use surveys as aggressively. We do \u2013 we watch what consumers really do. We watch what businesses really do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They can get this data, I think, other ways. And I think that's where the focus ought to be. How do we get the data to be more resilient and more predictable and more understandable?",
      "Because what bounces around is restatements. And that was one of the largest restatements going back five or seven years into the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Five years in the pandemic. That creates doubt around it. And so I think the key is, let's get \u2013 let's spend some money. Let's bring the information together. Let's find where else in the government money is reported.",
      "We report millions and millions of data points to the government every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The data is out there somewhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finally, back in January, you were at Davos. President Trump talked about Bank of America.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Many conservatives complained that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America.",
      "This conservative \u2013 they don't take conservative business. And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to respond to the allegation that conservatives are not being allowed to do business with your bank?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender.",
      "So, that's not \u2013 the issue they're focused on is, the regulators' impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this, this week, this reputation, this after-the-fact look that you banked X, and now, after the fact, you're going to say X didn't turn out to be what you thought.",
      "So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for the client.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there \u2013 are there industries you're uncomfortable doing business with?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: No, we do business with\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Guns, oil and gas, tobacco, all of it?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We do business with all those industries.",
      "Individual companies, because of credit decision stuff, that's different. But the reality is, is that, if they gave us clarity for the regulatory thing and avoid the second-guessing, that would be helpful. And I think that's what the president was pointing out, if you listen to him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Brian Moynihan, thank you for giving us some insight into the data you are seeing.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a moment. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Canadian minister for U.S.-Canada trade, Dominic LeBlanc, who joins us this morning from Moncton, Canada.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC (Minister for Canadian U.S.-Trade): Good morning, Ms. Brennan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were just here in Washington negotiating. And while the talks are officially continuing, you left town without a deal, and you left town with now what is a 35 percent tariff on goods.",
      "How much of a setback was the president's decision to do that while you are still at the table?",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: So we were obviously \u2013 obviously disappointed by that decision.",
      "We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together. That's been the history of the 40-year free trade agreement that goes back to President Reagan. We were pleased the United States is respecting the terms of the USMCA agreement.",
      "That's vital, we think, to the cost of living and affordability certainly in the United States. It's true in Canada as well. So we're continue to do the work. We left always with a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship.",
      "Ambassador Greer, Secretary Lutnick engage with us in constructive, cordial conversations. So we're prepared to stick around and do the work needed. We think, Ms. Brennan, that the economies of both countries are strengthened when we do things together. The trading relationship between Canada and the United States is unlike other partners.",
      "One description which I \u2013 which I thought was very apt, we don't sell things to each other, as much as we build things together. And that's why it's difficult in this relationship when so much is integrated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: But we remain very optimistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but you heard Ambassador Greer say, Canada \u2013 because Canada retaliated to the initial tariffs all the way back in April, when Prime Minister Trudeau was in office, you're paying the price now, even though you have a new government in place.",
      "If that's the issue, why not make that concession and pull back?",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: So, Prime Minister Carney, our new prime minister, has, we think, built a very businesslike, respectful relationship with President Trump.",
      "We think that's obviously very important to Canada and we think to the United States. We're dealing with \u2013 take, for example, the steel sector in Canada. It's a strategic importance to national security in Canada, as it is for President Trump and the American economy.",
      "We now have a situation where there's a 50 percent tariff. We're the biggest steel export market for the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: We have a 25 percent tariff. There's a 50 percent tariff when we want to sell something into the United States. So, effectively, we're blocked from doing that.",
      "But the national security interests of Canada requires that we have a viable steel and aluminum sector. And my conversations with Secretary Lutnick and others are that therein lies an example where, if we do the right work together \u2013 we have, Ms. Brennan, the toughest rules of any country dealing with Chinese dumping into Canada.",
      "We have melt and pour tracing so that products coming from other countries with Chinese steel can't be dumped into the Canadian market. So we're looking and advancing ideas where we can do that work with the United States, at the same time ensuring that our economy continues to have sectors vital to the economic future of Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: But that's not in contradiction to President Trump's national security objectives in the United States, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to talk to you more about this idea of the so-called fortress North America to take on China and some of the specifics of the dispute on the other side of this commercial break.",
      "Please stay with us. We will have more questions for Minister LeBlanc shortly. We will see you in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including an interview with the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz. And the Democratic governor of the state of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham, will join us.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with the Canadian minister for U.S.-Canada trade, Dominic Leblanc.",
      "Minister, we were just talking about some of the sectoral tariffs, the metals. American automakers, GM, Ford, Stellantis, they have all said that these tariffs are hurting their profits. The 50 percent metal tariffs, which use Canadian aluminum, the secretary of the Treasury was talking about those just the other day, they're see the impact here in the United States. A bit of a backfire in some ways. Do you see room for maneuver on these? Are they willing to negotiate with you on those tariffs?",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC (Minister for Canada-U.S. Trade): Ms. Brennan, we \u2013 we hope so. And as I say, we're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies.",
      "But your example is a good one. Canadian aluminum companies massively supply the American market. And by putting a 50 percent tariff on aluminum from Canada, you've increased the price of a whole series of goods. The automobile sector again is an example where there's been deep integration.",
      "We're the biggest customer of U.S.-made automobiles. Heavily, heavily importing into Canada, light and heavy-duty trucks. Fifty percent of the cars that we have finished in Canada and sell to the United States are made up of American parts. So, therein lies a perfect example where instead of tariffing one another, or President Trump, for his national security reasons under his Section 232 tariffs, wants to have a strong domestic steel, aluminum, automobile sector. Well, so does Canada. And we \u2013 we understand and respect totally the president's view in terms of the national security interests. In fact, we share it. And what we've said to our American counterparts is, how can we structure the right agreement where we can both continue to supply one another \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: In a reliable, cost effective way that preserves jobs essential to the American economy, but the same thing is true obviously in Canada as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, are there any plans for the two leaders to speak? I saw President Trump said your prime minister called him Thursday and they just never connected. I mean are tensions that high? And given the changing justification for the tariffs, do you really feel like you're negotiating with the other side in good faith?",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: Sure, we do. Of course we do. As I say, the conversations have been informative, constructive, and cordial. I would expect the prime minister will have a conversation with the president over the next number of days. That's certainly my plan again with Secretary Lutnick, recognizing that we think there is an option of striking a deal that will bring down some of these tariffs, provide greater certainty to investment.",
      "We, Ms. Brennan, we passed in Canada our version of the president's one big, beautiful bill, it's called the One Canadian Economy Act, which we think will unlock up to $500 billion of investment in Canada for things like pipelines, port infrastructure, mines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: All of which offer huge opportunities to American businesses as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: So, we think there's a great deal \u2013 a great deal to work on together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Minister, we'll see if you can get one.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Change is coming for the country's Medicaid system as part of the enactment of the big, beautiful bill.",
      "To help us understand what's ahead, we turn now to the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
      "Good morning. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "DR. MEHMET OZ (Administrator, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got a lot of work ahead. I want to start on drug costs. The president put this 25 percent tariff on India. A big drug producer. The president's trade deal with the E.U. puts a 15 percent tariff on imported medicines from Europe. How do you stop the drugmakers from passing along those costs to people on Medicare and Medicaid?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, the president's letter on Thursday, for most favored nation pricing, is a good example of that. And he's been working on this tirelessly since the first administration.",
      "And just to put this in context for many of the viewers, about two-thirds of bankruptcies in America are caused by healthcare expenses. About a third of people when they go to the pharmacy, they leave empty handed. They can't afford the medication. So, the president has said, enough global freeloading.",
      "We've been covering much of the development costs for new drugs to cure cancer, do other things with lots of other illnesses that are life- threatening. Isn't (ph) it time for the American public to understand that we should not be paying three times more for the exact same medication in the same box, made in the same factory.",
      "So, the president is saying, equalize it out. Let's use a model that worked, for example, for external threats, that's what NATO did. Everyone has to pay a little more. We'll pay extra too. But we won't pay a lot more than everybody else so they actually have to raise their \u2013 their \u2013 if you cut contributions, in this case to an internal threat, which is illness, we'll pay a little less in America that way more Americans can afford these medications and it's a fair system for the entire globe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this was declared in these letters that were sent out to 17 pharmaceutical companies this past week and it calls for extending that to Medicaid drug prices. Is that intended to offset what will be, you know, cuts to Medicaid? And do you know, you know, if the companies are actually going to follow through on this? Like, how do you actually strong arm them into doing it?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, just get the numbers correct. We're putting 200 billion more dollars into Medicaid. So, we're actually investing in Medicaid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At a time when costs are going up. So \u2013",
      "MEHMET OZ: Costs are going up, but there's been a 50 percent increase in the cost of Medicaid over the last five years. So, I'm trying to save this beautiful program, this noble effort to help folks, giving them a hand up. And as you probably gather, if Medicaid isn't able to take care of the people for whom it was designed, the young children, at the dawn of their life, those at the twilight of their life, the seniors, and those who are disabled, living in the shadows as Hubert Humphrey said, then we're not satisfying the fundamental obligation of a moral government.",
      "And this president has said over and over that he believes that it is the wise thing and the \u2013 and the noble thing to help those who are vulnerable. And every great society does that. And we're going to as well.",
      "So, we're going to invest in Medicaid, as is required, but we want an appropriate return on that investment.",
      "One thing that Medicaid patients should not face are drug prices they can't afford.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Because then \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you enforce this with the pharmaceutical companies?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, the \u2013 the pharmaceutical companies, if you sit them down quietly, Margaret, and we've done that, and say, you went into this business at some point because you cared about people. I know there's many out there shaking their heads, but that is actually the truth. People go into healthcare, whether they're pharmaceutical companies or insurance companies or the PBMs or anybody in the space, evidence (ph), the CMS, the most impressive thing to me in my new task that the president's appointed me to is the remarkable quality of the people within the organization. Just unbelievably talented. They went into this job because they care about healthcare and about people.",
      "Somewhere along the lines people forget, they put numbers ahead of patients. And when that happens, then you start running into problems. So, we went to the pharmaceutical companies and we said, you appreciate this is not a fair system. We should not be paying more in America, three times more, for your products than you charge in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They get the joke. They understand the reality of this problem. They're engaging with us. We're in the middle of those negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The president has a unique power to convene. We've done it with dealing with prior authorization, this heinous process where patients feel like they're, you know, trying to get care from a doctor, everything's being done except all of a sudden the \u2013 the arm of insurance comes in and stops the whole process for unknown reasons, for week, sometimes months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Your \u2013 the insurance companies representing 80 percent of the American public got together and they said, because we pushed them, we're going to deal with this. We can do the same, I believe with the pharmaceutical industry, with most favored nation pricing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the changes that are coming because of this new law to Medicaid, which is jointly administered between the feds and the states. There are major reductions to federal healthcare spending here. One of the changes are these work requirements. It's about 20 hours a week, volunteer or work, to qualify for healthcare.",
      "What is the guidance you are giving to states on how to implement this? Because in this economy, things are more complicated. Uber driver, independent contractor, how do they show they work their 20 hours a week?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Last weekend I was at the National Governor's Association, with Secretary Kennedy, who has been a big advocate of work as well. And every Democratic president, and Republican president, has said that the foundation of a healthy welfare system, of a social system of support, is work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but I'm \u2013 but I'm asking how you actually implement that and register it so that people who are working do qualify and they don't get caught up in paperwork because they didn't file something on time, that kind of thing.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Right. As long as we're OK that people should work and would want to work, and it's not just work, it's community engagement. They can go get education, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They can take care of family members.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They can contribute in other ways. But work's a great way of doing it. It can get you out of poverty if you can find jobs and elevate yourself.",
      "There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven't been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now and we have invested already, as soon as the bill was signed, began pilots to try to demonstrate that we can actually do this correctly. We have pilots now in Louisiana and in Arizona.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: In both cases, within seven minutes, you can click on where you're working \u2013 you mentioned Uber. You're an Uber driver. You click that button on your phone. It just takes you to your payroll provider. Let's say it's ADP. We then ask your permission, can we connect with this payroll provider to \u2013 to demonstrate what you've actually been able to work and earn over the past month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: This also, by the way, confirms your eligibility.",
      "But there's a bigger benefit here. Once you do that, you're in, you're done. However, what if we take it one step further, Margaret? What if we go beyond just proving that you tried to work, to actually saying, you know what, you didn't work enough but we can actually help you by connecting you through employment office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're still figuring out the technology, but isn't there an end of December deadline for a lot of these things to be figured out, and how do you make sure that people don't get kicked off because, in the state of Georgia, which already had work requirements, they have really struggled to make this work.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, a couple of things. It's not the end of December. It's the end of December a year from now. And Georgia is apples and oranges. Georgia had a program only for people under the poverty level and, for those people, if they wanted, they could elect to come into a system to help them get jobs. There have been 50,000 reduction in head count of uninsured people in the overall program in the last five years. Overall, Georgia, 2 million less uninsured people. So, Georgia is using a lot of tactics, and they're going in the right direction.",
      "I would argue that if you have confidence in the American people and their desire to take the offer to try to get a job if we challenge you to that, and, remember, if you're an able-bodied person on Medicaid \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: You're spending 6.1 hours watching television or leisure time. So, you don't want that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Kafa (ph) Health Policy found 92 percent of adult Medicaid recipients already are working or they have the carve out because they have to have caregivers or they have to do other things.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They're fine. All they have to do is \u2013 there will be a simple app. If you're already carved out, that's super simple. If you're supposed to be \u2013 if you're able-bodied and you're supposed to be working, we want to help connect you to the job market and get you into work. We have twice as many jobs available in America as people seem to want them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The foundation of work is not just about fulfilling eligibility. The goal of healthcare insurance is to catalyze action in the right direction, to get you healthier, to give you agency over your future so you recognize you matter and you should have a job there for \u2013 to go out and change the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "So, there's a drug addiction problem in the country. How are those changes going to impact people who are on Medicaid in states like Kentucky, in states like West Virginia?",
      "MEHMET OZ: In many instances there are carveouts for folks who need \u2013 who have substance use disorder problems. There are programs to support \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do they prove that?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, they can either \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that in the app?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Yes, it will be in app. And the app, again, if we're being \u2013 but this is being developed by the United States Digital Service led by Amy Gleason, who is a wonderful technologist. She and I were with the president and Secretary Kennedy and the head of the \u2013 the czar for A.I. in this country on Wednesday talking about overall how we're going to change the use of health technology in America. We've got to get into 2025 with health technology, as is true in every other sector.",
      "If you're watching the show right now, you could also have been streaming media. You could take an Uber somewhere, ride share. You can do an Airbnb. Technology should make the system more efficient.",
      "We should have confidence that it will also allow us to do what we all agree is possible. If the whole challenge to a work requirement is that you don't have confidence in our ability to accomplish it, that's a separate question, because I do have confidence in the American people and we have confidence we can pull this off.",
      "Look at the passport system, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Right now you can go and get a passport in two weeks without having to go to the post office, send pictures in, all that's gone. It's fixable. Let's use technology.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm still confused on how someone who is in the throes of substance abuse is going to use an app to say I'm in the throes of substance abuse every week to file online, but \u2013",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, when they go \u2013 when they go in to get their help for their substance abuse treatment, assuming they're going for help on that, they can also get enrolled in \u2013 and those requirements can be fulfilled.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: We want to talk to them in as many ways as possible. It's not going to happen just because we put an app out there. You \u2013 you have social workers, other folk \u2013 elements who care a lot about this population who are coming together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: But they have to have some mechanism to report back. That just has not been done well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and this is incredibly detailed, and that's why we wanted to have you on. I have so many more questions for you on rural hospitals and \u2013 and some of the other criticisms. I have to leave it there for now but thank you, Dr. Oz.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Can I give you 30 seconds on rural hospitals? Because this is important.",
      "You have 7 percent of Medicaid money going to rural hospitals. We're putting $50 billion. The president wants this. The congress wants this. It will make a massive dent (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are a lot of questions about how you're going to dole that out and whether you have already made promises. Do you have any specifics for us?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Yes, we \u2013 we \u2013 it's going to be \u2013 they'll get the applications in early September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The \u2013 the \u2013 the money is designed to help you with workforce development, right sizing the system and using technology to provide things like telehealth that can change the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Imagine if we can change the way we think about the delivery of health and make it more about getting people healthy so you can thrive and flourish and be fully present in their own lives and as Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Oz, we'll leave it there.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn to New Mexico's Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. She joins us from Santa Fe.",
      "Governor, two out of five New Mexicans are on Medicaid. You've got a lot of rural hospitals. Have you figured out how to implement everything Dr. Oz just laid out?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM (D-NM): Absolutely not. There is no real way to implement this. It's more paperwork for everyone. It's more paperwork for federal government, for state governments, for county governments, for local hospitals, for independent providers. And you know what Americans really hate, Margaret? When you go to your primary care physician, and you spend 20 minutes sitting at a chair, not even on the exam table, while they are inputting data into a computer. So, this doesn't make any sense.",
      "We should be a society and a country that is connecting people to healthcare providers. I think the one thing that Dr. Oz represents, that's a fair representation, is, we should be healthier as Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: All right. And we need to be moving out of poverty. We need drug prices, we should talk about that, to come down. So, go after insurance companies. Do manufacturing here. Make sure we can negotiate fair prices. Let states do that. Because I guarantee you, we'll do a better job than the federal government.",
      "And lastly, get people early easy access. Today, more than half, or about half, our small businesses don't even offer healthcare coverage. So, you can get a job, but now what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, you said, though, in your state, because, as a governor, you're going to have to figure this out.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have reserve cash from some oil and gas revenues, as I understand it, that have been put aside. Doesn't that show it is possible for the federal government to shift more responsibility back to the states? That's the argument conservatives are making.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: They are. And it's temporary. There is no way any state, including this one, which, frankly, I am really proud of, we are in really good financial shape. That takes planning and effort.",
      "You know, our job projections continue to be met and exceed, unlike the federal jobs report, which is going in the opposite direction. So, I don't know where all these jobs are going to be in this anemic economy. I mean, it's so bad, with \u2013 the last time it was this bad, I was in college. And let me tell you, that was a very long time ago.",
      "And so, yes, temporarily, we can do that. But you can't do it over the long haul. The loss minimally to New Mexico over less than a decade is between $12 billion and $13 billion. And when, not if, rural hospitals and local providers close their doors, I can do this better than any other state. The last governor completely canceled behavioral health.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Six years later, we are still reeling from trying to rebuild. We put a billion dollars into behavioral health just this last legislative session. It is not so easy to rebuild something out of nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the $50 billion rural healthcare fund under this Republican law is supposed to give people the \u2013 your \u2013 states like yours the ability to come and say, we need this extra cash. Are you going to have to ask for that?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: I'm going to ask for every dollar the federal government has put aside anywhere that benefits a New Mexican. So, you've got $50 billion, that's $1 billion for each state if it was even. Do you know how much money it would take to shore up rural hospitals? More than a billion. And to put that in perspective, let me do this. It's a billion just for behavioral health. It's a billion plus just to keep people's coverage. It's another billion for prescription drugs. It's a billion dollars for rural provider delivery investments. And that's only 50 hospitals. You have hundreds of hospitals, hundreds, 400 rural hospitals across America that will shutter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: So, that's the number, at (ph) it is. We are \u2013 how do we pick these rural hospitals? And if you pick a southeastern rural hospital in New Mexico, what about the rural hospital in western New Mexico?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Economies fail. People have to move away. You don't have any OBGYN care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: That whole area collapses. And they are reducing rural healthcare delivery by about $134 billion. So, the $50 billion is just to make someone, somewhere feel like they recognize that this is a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: $900 billion out of Medicaid is catastrophic. Straight up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we ran through a lot of material here. I have more questions for you. But very quickly, can you tell me, you deployed the National Guard to counter unrest in New Mexico. How is that different from what the president did in California?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Well, they're not policing. They're doing the back-end work so that trained community policing and members of that training, right, those local police officers, they're on the streets. What we have in this country is a shortage of police officers. What I have in New Mexico is a partnership. So, they're doing all of the \u2013 they answer all of the emergency calls. They handle all the traffic clearance when we've got a crash. And it is working. We're beginning to see more productive fentanyl, drug-dealing high-end arrests than we did without The Guard. And I'm really proud of that work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: This is about partnering and leveraging, not about indiscriminately going after individuals who have not committed serious crimes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Governor, thank you for your time today.",

They had already been partying there for hours, setting up campsites for the night as misting trucks and water cannons spritzed them to cool them down from the 85F temperatures.",
      "\"It is something spiritual, that you can experience only every 25 years,\" said Francisco Michel, a pilgrim from Mexico. \"As a young person, having the chance to live this meeting with the pope, I feel it is a spiritual growth.\"",

      "The young people have been traipsing down cobblestoned streets in color-coordinated T-shirts, praying the Rosary and singing hymns with guitars, bongo drums and tambourines shimmying alongside. Using their flags as tarps to shield them from the sun, they have taken over entire piazzas for Christian rock concerts and inspirational talks, and stood for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to 1,000 priests offering the sacrament in a dozen different languages.",

Then, before an estimated 2 million people, John Paul told the young pilgrims they were the \"sentinels of the morning\" at the dawn of the third millennium.",

      "Verdone had already made plans to take an alternate route home Saturday afternoon, which would require an extra half-mile walk, because she feared the \"invasion\" of kids in her neighborhood would disrupt her usual bus route. But she said she was more than happy to make the sacrifice.",

    "story": [
      "Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe\u00a0was sentenced Friday to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a historic case that gripped the South American nation and tarnished the conservative strongman's legacy.",
      "The sentence, which Uribe said will be appealed, followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that he attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group in the 1990s.",
      "\"Politics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\" Uribe said after Friday's hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense's request because it would be \"easy\" for the former president to leave the country to \"evade the imposed sanction.\"",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday's sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \"think much more about the solution than the problem\" during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia's Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe's alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "Uribe in 2012 filed a libel suit against Cepeda in the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court in 2018 dismissed the accusations against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe.",
      "Martha Pe\u00f1uela Rosales, a supporter of Uribe's party in the capital, Bogota, said she wept and prayed after hearing of the sentence. \"It's an unjust sentence. He deserves to be free,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Sergio Andr\u00e9s Parra, who protested against Uribe outside the courthouse, said the 12-year sentence \"is enough\" and, even if the former president appeals, \"history has already condemned him.\"",
      "During Uribe's presidency, Colombia's military attained some of its biggest battlefield victories against Latin America's oldest leftist insurgency, pushing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into remote pockets and forcing the group's leadership into peace talks that led to the disarmament of more than 13,000 fighters in 2016.",

      "One of the tombs was empty while the other held the 1,000-year-old remains of an individual alongside four clay vessels and three pumpkin shell artifacts.",
      "According to archaeologist Jos\u00e9 Aliaga, the vessels' iconography and their black, white, and red colors \"allow us to establish a connection with the pre-Incan Chancay culture,' which is approximately 1,000 to 1,470 years old.\" Aliaga told The Associated Press that the individual was found wrapped in a torn bundle, in a sitting position with his legs against his chest, and his team will continue cleaning the remains.",
      "\"Lima is unique among Latin American capitals,\" Aliaga said, \"in that various archaeological finds are unearthed during nearly every civil project.\"",
      "The Peruvian capital of Lima, a city of more than 10 million people, has more than 400 archeological sites from the Inca era, the 15th century, or earlier, from the pre-Inca period, according to the Ministry of Culture.",
      "Astonishingly, Thursday's discovery was not the first time C\u00e1lidda, the company that distributes natural gas in Lima, has found archeological remains. Over more than two decades of excavation work to expand the underground network, the company says it has made more than 2,200 discoveries.",
      "Last month, utility workers found a 1,000-year-old mummy of a child aged between 10 and 15 while installing pipes. Archeologist Jesus Bahamonde told reporters at the time that the workers found the trunk of a huarango tree, \"which served as a tomb marker in the past.\"",
      "In April, archaeologists in Peru announced they found the\u00a05,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman\u00a0at the sacred city of Caral, in an area that for decades was used as a garbage dump.",
      "Just days before that, researchers carrying out excavation work in southern Peru found an ancient tomb filled with the\u00a0remains of two dozen people\u00a0believed to be battle victims.",

Van Dalen was not involved in Thursday's discovery.",
      "On Thursday, passersby stopped in their tracks to observe the burial site, even taking out their cellphones to take a picture.",

      "\"We received briefings from (the IDF) and spoke to folks on the ground. GHF delivers more than one million meals a day, an incredible feat!\" Huckabee said.",
      "Witkoff and Huckabee visited a GHF site in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, according to an official involved with the visit. The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "\"Today, we spent over five hours inside Gaza - level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions, and meeting with (GHF) and other agencies. The purpose of the visit was to give (President Trump) a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza,\" Witkoff said on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump \"sent his envoy to serve as his eyes and ears on the ground, reflecting his deep concern and commitment to doing what's right,\" GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay said in a statement. \"We were honored to brief his delegation, share our operations, and demonstrate the impact of delivering 100 million meals to those who need them most.\"",
      "All four of the group's distribution sites are in zones controlled by the Israeli military. Throughout their months in operation, these sites have become flashpoints of desperation, with mass crowds of people gathering outside but who have then come under fire from Israeli forces or been trampled in the resulting crush.",
      "The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, and GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to control crowds. But there has been a persistent pattern of people being killed by Israeli gunfire and even heavier weapons around the G.H.F. sites over the past five months, with the death toll in the hundreds.",
      "Witkoff's visit comes a week after U.S. officials walked away from ceasefire talks in Qatar, blaming Hamas and pledging to seek other ways to rescue Israeli hostages and make Gaza safe.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that he was sent to craft a plan to boost food and aid deliveries as part of an effort \"to save lives and end this crisis,\" while Mr. Trump wrote on social media that the fastest way to end the crisis would be for Hamas to surrender and release hostages.",
      "International organizations have said Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on food crises, said recent developments, including Israel's complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.\"",
      "Though the flow of aid has resumed, including via airdrops, the amount getting into Gaza remains far lower than what aid organizations say is needed. A security breakdown in the territory has made it nearly impossible to safely deliver food to starving Palestinians; much of the limited aid entering is hoarded and later sold at exorbitant prices.",
      "In a report issued Friday, Human Rights Watch called it \"a flawed, militarized aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths.\"",
      "Israel's military and the prime minister's office did not respond to a request for comment on the report.",

      "\"We were met on the road by tens of thousands of hungry and desperate people who directly offloaded everything from the backs of our trucks,\" said Olga Cherevko, an OCHA staff member.",
      "The war between Israel and Hamas started when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. They still hold 50 hostages, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals.",

      "The Los Angeles wildfires and severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according to a new report from the insurance company Munich Re.",
      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas.

      "Health officials are taking action against a substance that some are calling \"gas station heroin.\" The FDA is recommending that 7-hydroxymitragynine (also known as 7-OH) \u2014 a byproduct of the plant kratom \u2014 be classified as a Schedule I drug.",
      "HHS Secretary RFK Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary emphasized the importance of getting ahead of yet another wave of addiction before it can sweep across the country. Makary compared the distribution of 7-OH to the early days of opioid prescriptions, before doctors understood the addictive nature of painkillers.",
      "US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. speaks alongside Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary (L) about the sending of warning letters to companies for illegally marketing products containing 7-hydroxymitragynine, also known as 7-OH, as part of their actions combatting opioids, during a press conference at HHS headquarters in Washington, D.C., on July 29, 2025.\u00a0 (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)",

      "\"Vape stores are popping up in every neighborhood in America, and many are selling addictive products like concentrated 7-OH. After the last wave of the opioid epidemic, we cannot get caught flat-footed again,\" Makary said in an FDA statement. \"7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine. We need regulation and public education to prevent another wave of the opioid epidemic.\"",
      "During a news conference on Tuesday, Makary suggested that the public health community is often late to act against dangerous substances due to a \"disconnect between the ivory towers and the streets.\" He then pondered aloud if experts had been to vape stores, as it \"affects what we see in the operating room.\"",
      "According to the FDA, 7-OH is beginning to be recognized for its potential to be abused because of its ability to bind to opioid receptors. Additionally, the substance is widely available and may be appealing to children and teens as it is sold in fruit-flavored gummies and even ice cream cones. The FDA is also warning that 7-OH products \"may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom.\"",
      "\"I am in favor of this move because of the relationship of the 7-OH to the opioid receptors. This is essentially an opioid. It is semisynthetic and derived from the kratom plant whose leaves make a stimulant. There are no approved 7-OH drugs or diet supplements,\" FOX News Senior Medical Analyst Dr. Marc Siegel told Fox News Digital. \"Bravo to the FDA for this move \u2014 it should be listed as a controlled substance.\"",

      "Between 60% and 80% of patients will develop a rash, according to experts.",
      "Lyme disease is prevalent this time of year, especially in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and upper-Midwest regions of the U.S.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"We're looking for specific findings, like the classic bull's-eye rash, a swollen joint or a facial droop called Bell's palsy, which can be seen with Lyme disease,\" Dr.\u00a0Andrew Handel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Stony Brook Children's Hospital on Long Island, New York, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "Symptoms typically emerge two weeks after the bite, becoming more severe if they go untreated.",
      "AS LYME DISEASE TESTS MISS MANY ACUTE INFECTIONS, POTENTIAL AT-HOME TEST OFFERS HOPE FOR EARLIER DIAGNOSIS",

      "Those can include Bell\u2019s palsy (facial nerve paralysis), Lyme meningitis (often marked by severe headache, neck stiffness and fever) and carditis (inflammation of heart tissues).",
      "The infection can lead to severe muscle and joint pain, Lyme arthritis, cardiac complications and neurological conditions, experts told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "One of the earliest signs of Lyme disease is overwhelming fatigue and joint aches, according to Dr. Daniel Cameron, an epidemiologist in Mount Kisco, New York, who specializes in tick-borne illnesses.",
      "Other symptoms may include fever, brain fog, dizziness, palpitations and nerve pain, among others.",
      "Testing, treatment and prevention",
      "A blood test can help diagnose Lyme disease, but timing matters.",
      "\"The way we diagnose Lyme disease in the blood is by looking for antibodies, for the immune system's response to the infection, as opposed to other infectious testing, where you find the bacteria itself,\" Handel told Fox News Digital.",
      "TICK BITES AND LYME DISEASE: WHAT TO DO IF A TICK BITES YOU OR YOUR PET",
      "Testing too early can result in a false negative, as antibody tests often don't turn positive until three or four weeks after the tick bite occurred.",
      "After sustaining a tick bite, experts recommend immediately removing the tick and seeing a healthcare provider.",
      "Doctors will typically prescribe a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with a 200-milligram dose of the antibiotic doxycycline to be taken within 72\u2005hours of a high-risk tick bite, epidemiologists told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"It's the immune system\u2019s lingering response to the infection that you had in the past.\"",
      "Although studies have found this dose to be effective in the majority of cases, some physicians prefer a longer course of treatment for tick bites.",
      "\"I'm not a big fan of a single dose of doxycycline [200 mg] for a tick bite, even though it's pretty popular,\" Cameron told Fox News Digital. \"I don\u2019t feel comfortable with a single dose if I really\u00a0want to avoid Lyme.\"",
      "Instead, Cameron prefers a four-week course of antibiotics for suspected Lyme disease cases. For patients who don\u2019t want to take antibiotics right away, he said he will \"watch and wait\" to see if symptoms emerge and then treat accordingly.",

      "In the event that a patient develops Lyme, the disease typically responds well to a course of antibiotics, which may include doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime, according to experts.",

      "\"It helps to give our office and the state auditor's office more resources to take a look at efficiencies and ways to really drill down on determining a good return on investment of taxpayer dollars across North Carolina,\" Boliek said.",
      "\"I really support the effort,\" he said, in part. \"We've got the team in place, and we've got the ability to really get effective results.\"",

      "The bill includes a provision for the state auditor to establish a Division of Accountability, Value and Efficiency, otherwise known as the DAVE Act. The bill passed the legislature last week with bipartisan support \u2013 a 91-23 vote in the House and a 47-2 vote in the Senate.",
      "The measure now sits at Gov. Josh Stein's desk, and while it is unclear if he will sign the measure into law, the ability to override a potential veto is there with a Republican majority in both chambers and enough Democrat support.",
      "\"It will become law. I'm very confident that it will,\" Boliek said.",
      "Boliek explained that his office will be taking a \"data-driven approach\" to determining the best \"return on investment in taxpayer dollars.\" He also said his office will look across the entire state government to identify where it can be more efficient rather than focusing on specific key areas.",
      "\"I think it'd be unfair to sort of pick out one specific area where we see cuts are necessary because we haven't taken that deep dive yet, but we are going to use modern computer programs, we're going to use AI and we're going to use a lot of data analysis to come up with solid common-sense recommendations,\" he said.",

      "DOGE was led by Elon Musk before he later departed the federal government when his 130-day term as a special government employee was up. (Francis Chung/Politico/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Boliek said the legislature has asked for open positions in the state to be examined to determine why the roles are unfilled and, if necessary, what needs to happen in order to fill them.",
      "\"I don't think we're limited to just looking at cutting only. There may be areas where the state is responsible for serving citizens, and we're not putting in enough resources. The legislature has been very clear about giving us that freedom to take a look at those areas as well, like where we are underfunding certain things,\" Boliek added.",
      "When asked about areas the Trump administration focused on with DOGE that Boliek could continue with at the state level, he said he wants to pursue initiatives in a data-driven way to ensure his office is backing up its recommendations for cuts or enhancements with \"solid data\" and \"not just a feeling.\"",
      "\"The approach should be to take a look at how taxpayer dollars are being spent and ask \u2018what is the return on investment?\u2019 If we're spending tax dollars on a specific program, the real question is what kind of return are taxpayers getting for that amount of money? And that, I think, will drive decisions on recommendations,\" he said.",
      "DOGE REVEALS WHAT YOU GET FOR THE HALF MILLION YOU'LL PAY IN TAXES OVER YOUR LIFETIME",

      "\"It's one thing to expend money and appropriate money, it's another thing to appropriate money with some measurables,\" he said. \"That's really going to be key to us being able to be the most efficient.

The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",

      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",

Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens.

      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",

      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",

This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators.

      "cry",
      "You might already know that Facebook\u2019s biggest strength isn\u2019t the social media platform itself, but the user data it collects.",
      "The data we hand over without thinking twice is what this multibillion-dollar company uses to generate revenue. It sells that data to advertisers, who then try to make money off you by showing ads in the hope that you\u2019ll buy their products. I\u2019ll admit, sometimes the ad platform can be beneficial by connecting small businesses to potential buyers.",
      "However, since Facebook allows almost anyone to advertise with minimal moderation, it often leads to dangerous scams. Security researchers have found that a persistent malvertising campaign is plaguing Facebook, leveraging the reputations of well-known cryptocurrency exchanges to lure victims into a maze of malware.",
      "16 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED IN MASSIVE DATA BREACH",
      "An iPhone with Facebook login screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Facebook crypto scam works",
      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone. The victims targeted tended to be men interested in technology and finance, and some ads specifically honed in on users in Bulgaria and Slovakia, showing how attackers fine-tune their campaigns based on geography and demographics.",
      "An iPhone with Facebook login screen.",
      "6 ways to avoid Facebook crypto malware scams",
      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/clever-ev-hack-could-reinvent-diesel-trucking",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:00:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn&apos;t replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "If you think electric trucking means buying a brand-new semi, think again. Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn't replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
      "In 2025, transportation was the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. And for the first time, heavy-duty trucks edged out passenger vehicles in how much pollution they produce. That makes freight the low-hanging fruit in the fight to reduce emissions. But electrifying it? That's where things get tricky.",
      "Electric semis are pricey. They're also heavy, have limited range, and take too long to charge. Trucking companies, many of them small operators, run on razor-thin margins and can't afford long downtimes. Public fast-charging for trucks barely exists. And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "How do AI-powered scam alerts work?",
      "The alerts use machine learning models that constantly update and improve. These AI tools analyze billions of data points to detect new scam patterns, even ones they haven't seen before. If a payment seems suspicious, the system will interrupt the transaction with a tailored alert. And the higher the risk, the stronger the warning.",

      "Three years after leaving a sleepy Seattle suburb to run the school district in Fairfax County, Va., outside the nation\u2019s capital, Michelle Reid earns more money than the U.S. president and gets a car allowance. Now she wants a taxpayer-funded personal bodyguard.",
      "In new job posting\u00a0No. 25212BR on BrassRing, an online recruitment platform, the Fairfax County public schools superintendent is advertising for an \"Executive Protection Agent,\" based at the school district\u2019s C-suite headquarters on Gatehouse Road in Falls Church, Va. The deadline for applicants is Aug. 5.",
      "SCANDAL-PLAGUED SCHOOL DISTRICT REFERRED TO DOJ AFTER ANOTHER TRANSGENDER LOCKER ROOM CONTROVERSY",
      "The new job would earn between $84,552 to $143,880, according to the\u00a0FCPS pay scale for a \"Unified Scale-Schedule B/Grade 006\" job, paying far more than the\u00a0starting salary of about $58,000 that a new teacher gets in the school district.",
      "\"The Executive Protection Agent is responsible for ensuring the personal safety, security and operational continuity of the division superintendent across school campuses, public events, official travel, and private residences,\" the job description reads.",
      "Fairfax County Public Schools Division Superintendent Michelle Reid. (Fairfax County Public Schools)",
      "The new position comes at a time when public school officials, like Reid, are facing heightened accountability in the post-COVID era over curriculum, contracts, budgets and \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" policies. In 2021, the Biden administration targeted parents for charges of alleged \"domestic terrorism\" for raising concerns at school board meetings, but new email records\u00a0have revealed the allegations were overblown and politicized.",
      "Since taking over on July 1, 2022, Reid has come under fire for allegedly covering up scandals over improprieties in football recruiting, the withholding of National Merit awards from students and, most recently, defying Department of Education orders regarding Title IX protections for girls in sports and schools. The Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights\u00a0just announced that Fairfax County Public Schools and four other northern Virginia school districts, including Loudoun County Public Schools, violated TItle IX protections by discriminating against students on the basis of sex.",
      "Last November, the all-Democratic school board voted unanimously to\u00a0renew Reid\u2019s four-year contract and increased her annual salary to $424,146 from\u00a0$380,000, more than the salary of New York City\u2019s education chancellor. Board members also gave her a $12,000 annual car allowance. In contrast, the U.S. president\u00a0earns $400,000 annually.",
      "Over her tenure, Reid has been notoriously suspect of leaks, which occurred this week with frustrated school district personnel anonymously raising the alarm bell over the new bodyguard position. The job description notes three times that applicants must demonstrate \"discretion,\" noting in one mention that applicants \"must demonstrate a high level of discretion and maintain strict confidentiality in all aspects of the role.\"",

Open Doors is a global Christian charity which supports and speaks up for Christians persecuted for their faith.",

      "Judith, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, told Fox News Digital it was clear something was wrong even before she reached the village. \"On our way we could see people already leaving, carrying their bags, heading for more secure areas.",

      "\"Attackers came in\" she said, \"and they beheaded Christians in the church.\" The jihadis \"killed those they met in the church hall. Those who tried to flee, they caught them and killed them in the compound. And then some others who managed to run towards the road, those also were caught and killed. All of them were killed with machetes. Most of those Christians who were killed, were Catholics.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the grand tradition of shows with \u201cwives\u201d in the title, Netflix\u2019s new drama \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is a salacious soap centered on women behaving badly. But something is noticeably different in this east Texas town, where the wives of a conservative gubernatorial candidate, county sheriff and local megachurch reverend carry guns in their handbags. And despite their supposed traditional values and MAGA politics, several of these women are engaged in extramarital affairs \u2014 with each other.",
      "Based on the novel by May Cobb, creator and executive producer Rebecca Cutter\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d expands on the original\u2019s \u201cSingle White Female\u201d premise, transplanting Brittany Snow\u2019s Sophie from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to an NRA meeting upon her red-state arrival with her architect husband, Graham (Evan Jonigkeit). A former \u201cpolitical publicist\u201d on the Democratic side, Sophie immediately escapes to the bathroom for a Xanax and meets Margo Banks (Malin Akerman), the captivating, uninhibited wife of Graham\u2019s new boss and would-be politician, Jed Banks (Dermot Mulroney).",
      "Moral posturing is the name of the game down in this Texas town, where everything is bigger \u2014 including the charades. Most headlines about \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d revolve around Akerman\u2019s larger-than-life Margo, who, even in a bad wig, entrances Sophie alongside the rest of her legion with her feminine wiles and flirtatious attention. She and Jed have an \u201carrangement\u201d (\u201cOpen marriages are for liberals,\u201d she tells Sophie). \u201cI don\u2019t sleep with other men, and if Jed and I see a girl we like, we go for it.\u201d",
      "But Mrs. Banks isn\u2019t one for rules, so she\u2019s having dalliances with more than just whom her husband agrees to, and Sophie drops her liberal convictions to be with Margo quicker than she can unhook her bra. Soon enough, Sophie is keeping secrets from her husband, just like the rest of the wives, until the murder of a local cheerleader threatens to blow everyone\u2019s carefully manicured covers. Of course ethical nonmonogamy and sexual fluidity exist in Texas (the bi-curious, membership-based Skirt Club has regular events in Houston, Dallas and Austin), but unlike the \u201cdeplorable\u201d coastal elites, the residents of the fictional town of Maple Brook wouldn\u2019t dare bring up that kind of thing in polite conversation.",
      "Hypocrisy abounds in \u201cThe Hunting Wives,\u201d which debuted at No. 3 on Netflix last week with 5.2 million views and climbed to No. 1 on the platform\u2019s U.S. Daily Top 10 chart. With all of the attention the show is receiving, viewer reactions have proved feverish, with fans across party lines gamely questioning their sexuality after witnessing Margo\u2019s effects on Sophie (as well as Callie, another friend and sapphic lover who gets jilted once Sophie comes to town). The bisexual (emphasis on the sexual) nature of the show has been a central focus of most reviews and fan commentary, but, interestingly, there\u2019s much less homophobic reaction than there is criticism of Margo\u2019s secret affair with the 18-year-old son of her friend and the local reverend. Viewers, conservative and liberal alike, are majorly invested in the world of \u201cThe Hunting Wives.\u201d It\u2019s Margo\u2019s world, from Reddit threads to TikTok hot takes, and we\u2019re all living for it.",
      "Akerman has been feeling the love for her deliciously duplicitous character and said she finds Margo\u2019s contradictions are ultimately representative of humanity more broadly.",
      "\u201cI think that we people have a certain vision of how society works and marriage works and how we should be and what\u2019s asked of us,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cThis [show] tests those boundaries. Absolutely, I feel like humans are fluid people. We don\u2019t need to be put into one category, and I think it\u2019s OK to slide that scale and ask yourself and be whatever you feel like being, instead of what people tell you to be.\u201d",
      "Cutter, the creator and showrunner, said she wanted to play with paradoxes, toeing the line of satirizing the conservative culture of \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d without full-on vilifying the characters, a plight somehow achieved even when they\u2019re murdering people. Cutter points to Sophie as the resident liberal breaking her own moral code to be with Margo.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not exactly somebody who\u2019s standing up for what she believes in either,\u201d Cutter said. \u201cSo there\u2019s hypocrisy and bad behavior on both sides.\u201d",
      "On \u201cThe Hunting Wives,\u201d women having romantic and sexual relationships with one another is unspoken bad behavior. Although Jed doesn\u2019t mind his wife\u2019s sapphic leanings, his decision to run for governor requires a new kind of discretion and restraint that puts more sanctions on Margo than it does for his predilection for threesomes. Margo is key to his public persona as a good ol\u2019 boy with a classic Christian wife, and though no outright anti-gay utterings are made alongside disparaging mentions of abortion and immigration, Cutter said the homophobia was intentionally unspoken but implied.",
      "\u201cIn the Christian world, there\u2019s going to be a level of \u2018that\u2019s not OK,\u2019 which everyone is then transgressing,\u201d Cutter said. \u201cI think in that line, \u2018Open marriages are for liberals,\u2019 it\u2019s like we\u2019re coding it differently, even if the actions are the same.\u201d",
      "As heightened as it is, \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d reflects a very real population, which may be uncomfortable for some viewers struggling to find the fun in engaging with characters whose personal lives differ from their political motivations. On the other hand, men have been rewarded several times over for playing antiheroes on screen without the same kind of scrutiny that has some reviewers calling the series \u201cvulgar\u201d or challenging its ability to be referred to as a \u201cqueer show.\u201d It may be frustrating to acknowledge that people\u2019s sex lives don\u2019t always align with their public personas and voting habits, but \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d confronts the ways in which sanctimony is frequently a cover for self-destructive secrets \u2014 and neither political party has a monopoly on that.",
      "Conservative, gun-toting Texas provides a solid setting for a series like \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d to toy with conventions \u2014 which ultimately makes it enjoyable for most viewers to enter for eight fun and sexy episodes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so polarized as a nation,\u201d Cutter said, \u201cand it\u2019s not a serious show. So I think ultimately people just enjoy the ride.\u201d",
      "Having enjoyed success just two weeks into its debut, fans are hopeful a second season is imminent. Would there be a world in which an openly gay \u201chunting wife\u201d joins the ranks? Cutter said she hadn\u2019t thought about it: \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d"

    "summary": "In an extraordinary move to counter Republican redistricting in Texas, dozens of Democrats in the state House are landing in Illinois to deny a quorum.",
    "story": [
      "CAROL STREAM, Ill.  \u2014 A showdown over redistricting in Texas played out here on Sunday as dozens of state Democrats took refuge roughly 1,000 miles away from home, saying they fled Texas to deny quorum to Republican efforts to add as many as five congressional seats to their map.",
      "It culminated with Texas' Republican governor threatening to expel the Democrats from the Texas state House and potentially extradite them, saying they may be \"felons.\"",
      "The Texas state House Democrats filed off of buses and Ubers into a crammed county party headquarters at a strip mall Sunday night, standing alongside Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker to rail against what they charged was a racist, unfair and undemocratic attempt to overhaul the Lone Star State\u2019s political map.",
      "Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu said that he believed about 57 Democrats have left the state, with the bulk staying in Illinois for at least the immediate future. Other House Democrats were in Boston and Albany, N.Y.",
      "\"Gov. Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump so that Donald Trump can steal these communities\u2019 power and voice,\" Wu said. \"We will not be complicit in the destruction of our own communities. We're not here to play political games, we're here to demand an end to this corrupt process.\"",
      "After the news conference, Wu said there was real fear that some of their members could be arrested for defying a special session call.",
      "\u201cWe have discussed this. This is a topic of serious concern. We know the governor has no authority to send state troopers over here but we don\u2019t know what Donald Trump\u2019s going to do,\u201d Wu said.",
      "He argued there was no legal basis for arrests but then pointed to questionable actions taken by immigration officials in their nationwide sweeps.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not far-fetched from arresting state legislators because they feel like it, and consequences be damned,\u201d he added.",
      "On Sunday evening, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement making another threat, saying that if Democrats didn't return by the time the Legislature is set to convene at 3 p.m. CT Monday, he would invoke an opinion by the Texas attorney general that he said would allow the removal of those Democrats from the Texas House.",
      "He also said that those legislators \"may have also committed felonies\" if they are \"soliciting funds to evade the fines they will incur under House rules.\"",
      "The Texas Democrats face the risk of a $500-a-day fine. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the punishment in 2023, two years after state Democrats left the state for three weeks to block an elections bill from progressing.",
      "\"I will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons,\" Abbott said in the statement.",
      "The Democrats' plans were uncertain, with Wu saying he was taking it day by day in a plan to stay in Illinois brokered with Pritzker, who had met with the Texas caucus late last month and has directed staff to provide logistical support for their stay. Pritzker said he was not funding the Texas lawmakers and had not planned to help them pay their potential fines.",
      "\u201cThey are attempting to cheat,\u201d Pritzker said of Texas Republicans Sunday evening. Asked about his own state\u2019s congressional map \u2014 which has long been criticized for having been gerrymandered by Democrats, who now have a 14-3 congressional advantage in the state \u2014 Pritzker contended there was a difference.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the outcome,\" he said. \"The fact that we are very good in Illinois about delivering for the people of Illinois and then people react to that and vote for our candidate winning is very different than cheating mid-decade by rewriting the rule because their cult leader told them to do it.",
      "When asked if potential efforts by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul would also be cheating if they take similar action to match Texas as they have suggested, Pritzker said, \u201cRemember, all bets are off. All bets are when the cult leader and would-be dictator tells Texas to mid-stream change the game when they know they\u2019re going to lose in 2026. All bets are off. Everything\u2019s got to be on the table.\u201d",
      "Last week, Texas Republicans released a proposed new congressional map that would give the GOP a path to pick up five seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections. It followed President Donald Trump\u2019s public pressure for a new map in the state as he works to retain a majority in Congress in what historically is a difficult year for the party holding the White House.",
      "The proposed map would shift district lines in ways that would target current Democratic members of Congress in and around Austin, Dallas and Houston, as well as two already endangered Democrats representing south Texas districts that Trump carried last year.",
      "A House committee approved the gerrymandered congressional maps on a party-line vote Saturday morning. After the vote, the committee chairman, Republican state Rep. Cody Vasut, told NBC News the maps were drawn to help Republicans win more seats.",
      "\u201cThis map was politically based, and that\u2019s totally legal, totally allowed and totally fair,\u201d Vasut said. \u201cYou got states like California and New York and Illinois that have these really large margins between the percentage of seats they have and the percentage of votes that they\u2019re getting, and Texas is underperforming in that. And so it\u2019s totally prudent, totally right, for Texas to be able to respond and improve the political performance of its map.\u201d",
      "Politically, the move puts Pritzker at the center of a high-profile national fight. The governor, who is running for his third term in office, is also widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender. He has implored Democrats to resist Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "The origins of Pritzker\u2019s involvement began when the governor gave a keynote address to Oklahoma Democrats in June. Pritzker met privately in a \u201crobust\u201d meeting with the party chair to talk about the Texas redistricting, according to a person close to the governor. When Pritzker later met with Texas Democrats, he assured them they could come to his state and find support, including finding hotels, meeting spaces and other logistical assistance.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have got to stand up at this point and tell every individual in this nation, \u2018This is not normal. This is not democracy,\u2019\u201d Democratic state Rep. Ann Johnson told NBC News on Saturday.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got these Texas Republicans that are just rolling over and giving Trump what he wants because he\u2019s asked for it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s an affront to every citizen, not only in Texas but the nation.\u201d",
      "Natasha Korecki reported from Chicago, and Ryan Chandler from Austin, Texas."

      "Amid an ongoing manhunt, Montana authorities warned Sunday that Michael Paul Brown, the suspect accused of killing four people in a Montana bar Friday morning, could return to the town of Anaconda, where the shooting occurred.",
      "Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said at a news briefing Sunday afternoon that the suspect was \u201can unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood, for no reason whatsoever. So there absolutely is concern for the public.\u201d",
      "Knudsen said Brown is believed to be \u201can armed and extremely dangerous individual\u201d and advised members of the public to remain vigilant and call 911 immediately if they see him.",
      "A $7,500 reward is being offered to anyone with information about Brown, Knudsen added.",
      "Knudsen also identified the four victims of the shooting Friday morning as bartender Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64, and three patrons: Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59, David Allen Leach, 70, and Tony Wayne Palm, 74. All of the victims were from Anaconda.",
      "Kelley's daughter, Kristian Kelley, said her mother was a recently retired oncology nurse. She worked as a nurse for around 30 years and got a part-time job as a bartender at the Owl Bar \"to fill some of her time.\"",
      "\"It kept her a little bit social, just seeing people,\" Kelley said. Her mother had worked at the bar for around a year and a half, she said.",
      "She first heard of the shooting at her mother's workplace through a text from a friend.",
      "\"My first step was to call her, and I didn't get an answer,\" she said. That is when she drove to Anaconda and found out her mother was a victim.",
      "Kelley said she could never have imagined that such an incident would happen in Anaconda.",
      "\"We didn't even lock our cars outside, you know, or the house, and it's, I mean, I wouldn't say it's dangerous here at all,\" she said. \"But when people don't receive services, you know, in rural areas, sometimes this is what happens.\"",
      "Knudsen said a motive was still under investigation but noted that Brown was a regular at the bar, as he lived next door. Brown is believed to have lived alone, Knudsen said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s likely that he knew the bartender and these patrons, which makes this even more heinous,\u201d Knudsen said.",
      "Kelley said she knew Brown as someone in the community who would tell in-depth, seemingly made-up stories about his time in the military.",
      "\"Maybe they were pretty incredible, so I don't know, but I think a lot of them were embellished,\" she said. \"And maybe he believed them. I'm not sure, but he definitely was somebody that needed care.\"",
      "Knudsen said that the shooter used a rifle in the shooting and that Brown had access to firearms.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to catch this guy. This is still absolutely priority No. 1,\u201d Knudsen said.",
      "A manhunt has been underway since Friday morning, when Brown is alleged to have walked into the Owl Bar at around 10:30 a.m. and opened fire, authorities said.",
      "Authorities said Brown fled wearing a tie-dye shirt, blue jeans and an orange bandana. However, a picture released Saturday by the Montana Department of Justice purported to show him fleeing the scene apparently stripped down to just his boxers.",
      "Knudsen said that the picture was taken \u201crelatively soon\u201d after the shooting and that Brown got rid of some of his belongings and clothes. However, he was able to get his hands on a stolen vehicle that had some clothing in it and is now believed to be fully clothed, Knudsen said.",
      "Law enforcement officers briefly pursued Brown in that vehicle but pulled back when they realized he was most likely armed, Knudsen said. Brown was not in the vehicle when law enforcement finally got to it.",
      "Knudsen did not rule out that Brown may have killed himself but said authorities \u201care acting under the assumption that he is alive, well, armed and extremely dangerous.\u201d",
      "Brown is known to local law enforcement and has a criminal record, Knudsen said.",
      "Anyone who sees him is urged to call 1-877-wanted2, Knudsen said. As the search continues, Knudsen did not rule out that additional arrests could be made.",
      "Officials have focused the multiagency search on the area off Stumptown Road and expanded it to Barker Lake and the surrounding area. Brown is a resident of the area and familiar with its terrain, Knudsen said in an interview.",
      "\"We've got a lot of locals on our side,\" Knudsen said. \"Also, we've got a lot of assets in the air; we've got a lot of assets on the ground. We're going to find him.\"",
      "Knudsen said he believes Brown is on the run on foot, not in a vehicle.",
      "\"These things do not happen in Montana,\" Knudsen said about the shooting. \"This is extremely, extremely rare and out of the ordinary for us here, and I think that is shown through our law enforcement response.\"",
      "Friends said Brown has a history of mental health issues. Shane Charles, who grew up with him in Anaconda and owns another bar, told NBC News that Brown struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re so tightly fought, it\u2019s hard to say the momentum\u2019s on anyone\u2019s side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough but fun racing against Oscar.\u201d",
      "The Formula 1 world championship battle has solidified into a one-on-one showdown between the two McLaren rivals. Heading into the nearly monthlong summer break, Piastri has 284 points to Norris\u2019 275.",
      "Reigning four-time world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull sits in a distant third with 187 points; his hopes for a fifth title are all but finished. He finished a lowly ninth place in Hungary.",
      "Piastri made an ambitious lunge on Norris in the penultimate lap, but overdid it and locked his front wheel, nearly crashing into his teammate. He was given a gentle reprimand by his team on the radio: \u201cRemember how we go racing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI pushed as hard as I could,\u201d Piastri said after the race. \u201cThe car really came alive in the second half of the race.\u201d",
      "McLaren team principal Andrea Stella discussed the radio message to Piastri in an interview with F1TV after the race.",
      "\u201cThe reminder was for both: one, make sure you don\u2019t dive into the inside too aggressively. The other one, don\u2019t move under braking,\u201d Stella said, adding that he understands both are fighting for the title. \u201cIt\u2019s fair that they try their best, but all these should happen within our principles.\u201d",
      "It was the fourth consecutive race where the McLaren drivers finished first and second, showing the dominance of the papaya-colored team this year, which scored its 200th victory in F1 on Sunday. Mercedes\u2019 George Russell finished in third place after a feisty battle for the final podium position.",
      "Leclerc wins pole but loses it in the race",
      "Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc captured a shock pole position on Saturday and comfortably led away from Piastri and Norris at the start, after they qualified in second and third place.",
      "Norris got a decent start and pulled to the inside of Piastri before his teammate moved to cut him off, compromising Norris and costing him two positions in the opening corners.",
      "Piastri\u2019s move kept him ahead of his rival at the start and gave him preferential treatment for the first pit stop. But Norris\u2019 camp spiced things up by gambling on a one-stop strategy, pitting him later, on lap 31. When Piastri pitted again, on lap 46, he came out about 12 seconds behind Norris \u2014 but carrying tires that were 14 laps younger to fight with.",
      "Piastri then overtook Leclerc, making it a two-person race at the front between the championship rivals. He closed up behind Norris and attacked him, but failed to get past.",
      "\u201cAfter I saw Lando going for a one [stop], I knew I was going to have to overtake on track, which is must easier said than done around here,\u201d Piastri said. \u201cI tried a few things. It was a gamble either way. And today unfortunately we were just on the wrong side of it.\u201d",
      "Hungary was the race that foreshadowed their rivalry one year ago. Piastri pulled ahead at the start, but Norris took the position back at the pit stops due to strategic decisions by McLaren. Then the team ordered Norris to slow down and let Piastri overtake him for the win \u2014 which he did after resisting it for many laps. It was a dramatic and controversial sequence that led to Piastri\u2019s first Grand Prix victory in Formula 1. Overall, Norris comfortably beat the younger Piastri throughout the 2024 season, but fell short to Verstappen in his bid for the championship.",
      "This year, the McLaren drivers have been more evenly matched. A series of midrace radio messages between the McLaren drivers and their race engineers crystallized the battle.",
      "After dipping a wheel into the gravel, Lando was told to \u201cjust keep the focus \u2014 you don\u2019t want those mistakes.\u201d It came one race after Norris was similarly put on a different tire strategy but made a few crucial errors that prevented him from challenging Piastri.",
      "Piastri, meanwhile, was asked midrace whether he wants the strategy to focus on challenging Leclerc for the win or fending off Norris for second place. Piastri\u2019s response was telling: \u201cIf you still think beating Lando is realistic, then: doing that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really care about Leclerc,\u201d Piastri added on team radio a few laps later. \u201cI just want the best chance to try and beat Lando. That\u2019s the important thing at the moment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s all about the world championship.",
      "Verstappen says he's staying at Red Bull",
      "The race weekend also put an end to two of the biggest open questions in the sport.",
      "Verstappen, the reigning four-time world champion, told reporters he will stay with the embattled Red Bull team next season, finally settling persistent questions about whether he will jump ship to Mercedes.",
      "Ferrari announced it is re-signing team principal Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur to a \u201cmultiple-year contract,\u201d ending some recent speculation about the Italian team\u2019s leadership.",
      "But all was not well with the team this weekend. Leclerc voiced his frustration with the team\u2019s decision-making midrace as his hopes of victory faded. Leclerc ultimately lost third place on lap 62, when Russell overtook him.",
      "And Ferrari\u2019s Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time world champion, qualified 12th in Hungary before calling himself \u201cuseless\u201d while speaking to reporters. Hamilton finished in 12th place.",
      "The next F1 race is on Aug. 31 in the Netherlands."

    "story": [
      "White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett on Sunday defended President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as the president\u2019s claim that weaker-than-expected jobs reports were \u201crigged,\u201d but failed to produce any evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim.",
      "\u201cWhat we need is a fresh set of eyes over the BLS,\u201d Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a monthly jobs report that included weaker-than-expected numbers for July, plus major downward revisions of May and June\u2019s numbers.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Friday, the president said the jobs numbers were \u201crigged\u201d and that he\u2019d asked his team to fire BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "\u201cWe need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "In another Truth Social post, the president added, \u201cIn my opinion, today\u2019s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Hassett cast similar doubt on the accuracy of the jobs numbers, pointing to past revisions that were made to jobs reports after then-President Joe Biden stopped running for re-election last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been a bunch of patterns that could make people wonder. And I think the most important thing for people to know is that it\u2019s the president\u2019s highest priority that the data be trusted and that people get to the bottom of why these revisions are so unreliable,\u201d Hassett told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "He added later in the interview that the Trump administration\u2019s goal was to understand why there was such a sizable revision to past months\u2019 jobs numbers.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that there were people involved in creating these numbers. And if I were running the BLS and I had a number that was a huge, politically important revision, the biggest since 1968 actually ... then I would have a really long report explaining exactly what happened. And we didn\u2019t get that,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "It's not uncommon for jobs reports to be revised in the months following their release, but Hassett emphasized Sunday that July's revision was one of the largest he's seen in decades.",
      "Trump faced criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress on Friday when he decided to fire McEntarfer, with several Republican senators questioning whether the firing would actually help the Trump administration improve future jobs numbers.",
      "\u201cWe have to look somewhere for objective statistics. When the people providing the statistics are fired, it makes it much harder to make judgments that, you know, the statistics won\u2019t be politicized,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told NBC News on Friday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to look into it, but first impression is that you can\u2019t really make the numbers different or better by firing the people doing the counting,\u201d he added.",
      "Hassett said Sunday that installing Trump\u2019s \u201cown people\u201d will help achieve more \u201ctransparent and reliable\u201d jobs reports in the future.",
      "\u201cThe president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers, they\u2019re more transparent and more reliable. And if there are big changes and big revisions \u2014 we expect more big revisions for the jobs data in September, for example \u2014 then we want to know why, we want people to explain it to us,\u201d he said.",
      "Later on Sunday, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., joined \"Meet the Press\" and accused the president of trying to \"weaponize\" the Bureau of Labor Statistics for his own agenda.",
      "Padilla also said the Senate would evaluate the \"independence\" of a new BLS commissioner when it comes time to confirm a new one.",
      "\"That's the big question for members of Congress who will have to confirm, members of the Senate, who have to confirm whoever Trump replaces,\" Padilla told Welker. \"Confirmation hearings are supposed to be about 'Is it going to be somebody that will maintain the independence of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,' like so many other departments and agencies that need to have the independence from the political pressure of the White House to do their job reliably.\"",
      "\"When [Trump's] trying to weaponize the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that tells you a lot about their insecurity about the economy and the state of economic affairs,\" Padilla added later.",
      "Hassett also spoke about the president\u2019s evolving tariff agenda.",
      "Last week, Trump formalized trade deals with countries including the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom and imposed sweeping tariffs on some of the U.S.\u2019 largest trading partners, like Canada, which now faces a 35% tariff rate on goods not covered by the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement.",
      "Hassett on Sunday echoed Trump\u2019s statements to NBC News earlier in the week, indicating that there was still room to make trade deals for nations that hadn\u2019t yet concluded negotiations.",
      "\u201cFor the deals that aren\u2019t ready yet, they\u2019re going to get the reciprocal rates soon, and then we would expect that there might continue to be negotiations with those countries,\u201d he told Welker.",
      "Hassett also cast doubt on the idea that higher tariffs on consumer goods could lead to inflation, as economic analysts have been predicting for months.",
      "Instead, Hassett blamed inflation on the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cEvery measure of inflation, if you aggregate it, if you look at the top-line numbers, is lower than it\u2019s been in five months,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cSo inflation has come down. And inflation has come down for a lot of reasons, but I think the main reason is that we\u2019re no longer printing money and sending it to people like the Bidens did. That\u2019s a recipe for inflation.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don\u2019t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1.",
      "Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there\u2019s still time to save \u2014 tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year.",
      "Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "What to buy as tariff-related price hikes roll out",
      "We don\u2019t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn\u2019t mean you should panic buy \u2014 it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you\u2019ve been saving up for. It\u2019s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty.",
      "A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t shooting up.  But it\u2019s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We\u2019re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again.",
      "Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too.",
      "Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They\u2019re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties.",

These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide.",
      "Bounty Paper Towels",
      "Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines.",

      "Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor.",

      "The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it\u2019s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon \u2014 its price could increase at any point, and it\u2019s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2.

      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper\u2019s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. \u201cI bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I\u2019m really picky about my mattresses because I\u2019m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn\u2019t trap heat, in my experience.\u201d",
      "Baby gear",
      "Uppababy Aria Infant Car Seat",
      "The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you\u2019re in the market for one of the brand\u2019s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand\u2019s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand\u2019s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you\u2019re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent.",
      "Coterie Monthly Diaper Box",
      "Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited \u201cglobal economic factors and rising material costs\u201d as the reason for the hike.",
      "Rabinowitz started buying the brand\u2019s diapers when his baby was born last year. \u201cUsing Coterie\u2019s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don\u2019t have ingredients that I\u2019m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cThe subscription is easy to use and very flexible \u2014 if I\u2019m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.\u201d",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2 Travel Stroller",
      "Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn\u2019t specify which ones \u2014 if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo\u2019s compact travel stroller. \u201cThe Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it\u2019s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.\u201d",

      "Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1.

      "Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven\u2019t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April \u2014 that won\u2019t be the case forever though. \u201cCompanies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that\u2019s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,\u201d says Ales. \u201cBut eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they\u2019ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.\u201d",
      "Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. \u201cThe tariff needs to be absorbed by someone \u2014 is it the business or the consumer?,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it\u2019s going to be almost universal,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cRight now, it seems like it\u2019s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.\u201d That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal.",
      "There\u2019s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by.",
      "Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. \u201cSo far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There\u2019s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they\u2019re accepting the volatility around tariffs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don\u2019t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.\u201d",
      "Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now.",

      "\u201cOnions are naturally antimicrobial while rich in sulfur and antioxidants so there is truth in onion being potentially helpful as an ingredient in hair products,\u201d says Dr. Anna Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Florida. Because of this, there are a number of shampoos on the market that list onion extract as one of their primary ingredients.",
      "Below, we spoke to experts about the potential benefits associated with onion shampoo, whether you can use it if you have color-treated hair and more \u2014 plus, gathered a few highly rated options for you to shop.",
      "What is onion shampoo?",
      "Onion shampoo is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 shampoo that has onion as a main ingredient. Though it may sound funky, the experts we spoke to agree that onion extract can help hair health. \u201cOnion contains sulfur, which is a key building block for keratin, the protein that makes up your hair,\u201d says Dr. Ross Kopelman, a hair transplant surgeon at Kopelman Hair Restoration. \u201cIt also has antimicrobial properties that can support a healthier scalp environment. Some studies suggest it may increase blood flow to the scalp and reduce inflammation, which are both important for hair health.\u201d",
      "Most commonly, hair products with this vegetable are aimed at helping with hair thinning and encouraging growth. One clinical trial even found that when onion extract was applied topically, it helped people with alopecia areata (an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss) with regrowth. \u201cWhile we need more research, I\u2019ve seen some patients benefit when using onion-based treatments as part of a broader hair care routine,\u201d says Kopelman.",
      "The perks may sound great, but worried that onion shampoo will leave you smelling like the deli counter? Don\u2019t be. While onion extract may be a primary ingredient, the shampoos available that use it also have other beneficial (and pleasant-smelling) ingredients, such as lavender or rosemary.",
      "Can anyone use onion shampoo?",
      "In general, over-the-counter shampoos with onion extract are gentle and sulfate-free, so they should be safe for just about everyone to use. That said, if you have color-treated hair, you may want to think twice. \u201cOnions are acidic, so using them on color-treated hair can disrupt the delicate PH balance needed to prolong the look of freshly colored hair,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cAvoiding the shaft of the treated hair and concentrating at the scalp is an option but be sure to patch test to ensure you don\u2019t have any scalp sensitivity.\u201d",
      "Chacon also recommends that those with sensitive skin proceed with caution. \u201cThe smell could also be a hindrance here as well as the effect onions have on the eyes and the close proximity of the scalp to the eyes,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cInstead, I would opt for rosemary oil \u2014 which is an alternative natural ingredient that has all of the antifungal, growth promoting effects but with a pleasant scent.\u201d",
      "Finally, if you are allergic to anything in the allium family (like onions or garlic), it\u2019s best to skip this type of shampoo. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few cases of contact dermatitis from poorly formulated onion shampoos,\u201d says Kopelman. \u201cAlso, if you have eczema or active scalp inflammation, it\u2019s best to consult with a specialist before adding anything new to your regimen.\u201d",

      "A boater in Barnegat Bay near Long Beach Island, New Jersey, reported Saturday afternoon that a vessel had struck a whale, the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, or MMSC, said on Facebook. Sea Tow, which was called in when the whale was spotted in the bay, reported to MMSC that the whale was dead.",

      "Other videos posted by the witness show a whale swimming around the shallow waters and violently thrashing its tail.",
      "Boat captain Charlie Nunn told NBC Philadelphia that this was a freak accident and was not caused by the boaters antagonizing the whale. He said he believes they were in the area before the whale swam through.",
      "He said the whale was likely anxious and in fight-or-flight mode, causing the forceful crash.",

      "Fans might remember the integral prom scene in Season 2 of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d that leads Belly and Conrad (Christopher Briney) to break up. \u201cMayonaise\u201d by the Smashing Pumpkins is the song Han ultimately chose to feature in the background.",

The couple eventually reaches a breaking point at prom when Conrad forgets Belly's corsage and tells her he isn\u2019t going to spend the night after the dance. Belly perceives his emotional distance as disinterest.",

      "But Conrad can\u2019t move past the fact that he feels like a disappointment to Belly. They leave the dance floor to escape the song\u2019s booming drums and talk outside. The two decide to end their relationship as the brooding song can still be heard playing from the dance floor.",
      "But \u201cMayonaise\u201d almost didn't set the wistful tone for this intense moment, Han reveals. Instead, she says one person advocated for featuring Mazzy Star\u2019s classic \u201cFade Into You.\u201d",
      "\"Which I love, it's a beautiful song,\" Han says. \"But I think it had been used on something else recently. You want to be mindful of that because you want the moment to have its own time.\"",

      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter Tour,\u201d which concluded in Las Vegas on July 26, included a surprise Destiny's Child reunion with Williams and Kelly Rowland, as well as performances by Shaboozey and Jay-Z.",
      "Williams reflected on the moment during a July 29 episode of her podcast \u201cChecking In with Michelle Williams,\u201d sharing the behind-the-scenes story about how the reunion came to be, including the last-minute rehearsals and decisions to be made about the performance itself.",
      "During the rehearsals, Williams said she had one past incident from decades prior at the top of mind that kept her on edge.",
      "\u201cI was trying to stay focused because y\u2019all know I still have trauma from falling on \u2018106 & Park,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI need y\u2019all to be my therapist about that too because every time I perform with the girls, it\u2019s in my head, \u2018Do not fall. Do not fall. Do not fall.\u2019\u201d",
      "Williams cited the incident from more than 20 years prior when Destiny\u2019s Child appeared on \u201c106 & Park\u201d to promote their final studio album, \u201cDestiny Fulfilled.\u201d",
      "While performing their song \u201cSoldier\u201d on the show, Williams, Rowland and Beyonc\u00e9 were walking down the stage in unison when Williams tripped and fell. The singer quickly recovered and stood back up before diving into the dance moves, though the incident left an impression on Williams over the years.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s still in my head,\u201d she added. \u201cSteps do frighten me.\u201d",
      "Williams noted that in the Broadway musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d she has to descend steps during the show, though she noted that she has \u201ctwo gorgeous men on the right of me and the left of me holding my hand\u201d to help her down.",
      "\u201cDid I rehearse them steps? Sure did,\u201d Williams said, referring to her \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d steps. \u201cAnd then when it came to, I was like \u2018Oh my gosh, you dummy. You let fear or lack of trust on that first step,\u2019 because y\u2019all I\u2019m not going to let social media do me, because if that were to happen and I fell, I would not be able to live that down for the next 20 years.\u201d",
      "Williams said the only aspect of the reunion performance she didn't like was her lack of trust in the steps, citing her experience starring in \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d for over a year between performances in Chicago and on Broadway in New York City.",
      "\u201cThere are certain aspects of that stage that I know, I\u2019m comfortable. I don\u2019t have to look at certain marks,\u201d she explained. \u201c There are certain things that I know that I can hit because I\u2019m at home on that stage. I\u2019m not at home on the \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 stage, nope. And y\u2019all wasn\u2019t going to do me. So that\u2019s the only thing that I\u2019m like, \u2018You could have trusted that the steps were not going to let you down.\u2019\u201d",
      "Williams said that all of the necessary changes were made \u201cwardrobe wise\u201d to make sure she wouldn't tumble on the \u201cCowboy Carter Tour,\u201d including requesting for the fringe to be cut off of the pants she wore to reduce to risk of tripping and falling.",
      "Despite the fear of the moment she experienced, the singer said that everything fell back into place for the group, sharing, \u201cWe turned into little girls again, them teenage girls, those younger girls who just wanted to since, dance and travel the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd Beyonc\u00e9 was like \u2018Y\u2019all, let\u2019s have fun. We just going to go out there and have fun. Whatever happens, happens, but we\u2019re going to have fun,\u2019\u201d Williams added. \u201cI knew we were going to have fun, we always have fun, but when you come from Destiny\u2019s Child, and then when you see the level of excellence that Beyonc\u00e9 performs at, you step it up.\u201d",
      "There were no missed steps in sight during the reunion on the \u201cCowboy Carter Tour.\u201d",
      "The trio, who officially disbanded in 2006, were in lock step as they kicked off their performance with a synchronized strut to kick off \u201cLose My Breath.\u201d",
      "Their medley transitioned into Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d track \u201cEnergy,\u201d including the mute challenge from last tour, before ending with their hit single \u201cBootylicious.\u201d"

      "\u201cIf you know me, you know I\u2019m obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted,\u201d he captioned the post, in part. \u201cYou also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I\u2019m incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place,\u201d he added.",
      "Rife purchased the property with viral ghost hunter Elton Castee, both of whom are now the legal guardians of the museum's artifacts for \u201cat least five years,\u201d according to Rife.",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, New England Society for Psychic Research director Tony Spera, son-in-law of the famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, clarified that while Rife and Castee purchased the home, he and wife Judy Spera remain the owners of the artifacts. NESPR is a paranormal research group founded by the Warrens in 1952.",
      "\u201cAll of the artifacts, including the infamous Annabelle doll, are owned by Judy and myself,\u201d Spera said, later adding, \u201cWe have no plans to ever \u2018sell\u2019 the artifacts.\u201d",

      "What Is the Annabelle Doll?",
      "The Annabelle doll came into popular culture with the release of a 2014 horror film, which follows the story of a possessed doll haunting a couple nearly to their death.",

      "\u201cThe two roommates tried to accept the doll\u2019s spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent,\u201d the NESPR website says.",
      "Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren deemed the doll \u201cdemonically possessed\u201d and removed it from the house, per NESPR, which is funded by the Warrens' son-in-law Tony Spera. The couple then \u201cencased it in a glass box to contain the evil spirited entity.\u201d",
      "A representative from the NESPR did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rife's post about purchasing Ed and Lorraine Warren's home.",
      "What's Next for the Annabelle Doll?",
      "The Annabelle doll notably left the Warren house this year for the \u201cDevils on the Run Tour.\u201d The nationwide tour showed the Warrens\u2019 work and displayed Annabelle.",
      "During the tour, Dan Rivera, a paranormal investigator and handler for the Annabelle doll, died at 54 on July 13 in a Pennsylvania hotel. Adams County Chief Deputy Coroner Scott Pennewill noted \u201cnothing suspicious\u201d surrounded Rivera\u2019s death.",
      "Pennewill confirmed the Annabelle doll was not present at the scene, adding that Rivera was found alone. Rivera\u2019s cause of death has not been released, and at time, Pennewill said Rivera\u2019s autopsy results would likely be available within 60 to 90 days.",

      "Rapp stopped by TODAY in June to discuss her album \u201cBite Me\u201d and perform a few of her hits. She also took the time to answer some questions as part of our \u201c8 Before 8\u201d series, lighting up when she got to a question about \u201cSVU.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you had \u2013\u201d Rapp began, pausing before continuing, \u201cWhoever came up with this question, I just want to say thank you so much. You\u2019ve done more for my community than you can even imagine.",
      "\u201cAnd my community is just me, really,\u201d she said, laughing.",

      "She publicly came out as a lesbian during a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch in January 2024, after previously identifying as bisexual, and is beloved by her fans for how open she is in her work and on social media.

      "\u201cThere was an episode where they were talking about it and considering if she was gay,\u201d Rapp recalled of Benson. \u201cI feel like Christopher Meloni\u2019s character was like, \u2018No, like, you\u2019re a lesbian.\u2019 And she was was like, \u2018Um, no.\u2019 Liar.\u201d",
      "In the episode, Benson and Stabler work with Griffin\u2019s Babs Duffy, the leader of a lesbian rights group, as they search for a rapist targeting gay women. Babs knows how to push both of their buttons, going in for a kiss with Benson at one point, prompting the detective to later ask her partner if he ever gets \u201ca gay vibe\u201d from her.",
      "\u201cWould it matter if I did?\u201d Stabler says.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not answering the question,\u201d Benson says, to which Stabler adds, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve had a lot of luck with guys.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called being married to the job,\u201d she says.",

      "Benson nods, and Stabler says, \u201cI get hit, you get hit on,\u201d referencing a punch he was on the receiving end of from a female suspect earlier in the episode.",
      "\u201cI would be her lover,\u201d Rapp confidently says now of Benson, \u201cand we would somehow get tangled in, like, an undercover kind of miss(ion), probably with a drug empire.\u201d",

      "Carson added that dealing with the film\u2019s profound subject matter was a \u201cbeautiful challenge.\u201d One of her favorite parts of the film was how they handled its tragic ending with comedy.",
      "\u201cIt was so important that comedy was the thing that always grounded our film. I think in times of darkness and loss, comedy is often how we cope,\u201d Carson says. \u201cComedy is what makes even the deepest moments just hit even harder.\u201d",

      "Israel announced last Sunday it would pause military activity in some areas to allow more aid into Gaza following international outrage over widespread starvation and deaths from malnutrition caused by the Israeli military\u2019s offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "But humanitarian organizations say the amount of aid that has entered the enclave is not enough, and without more food, growing numbers of Palestinians will die from hunger.",
      "NBC News takes a look at how much aid has entered Gaza in the week since Israel announced the new system, and how that stacks up to the needs of the population.",
      "A tally of aid",
      "Humanitarian aid is entering Gaza in three ways: airdrops, distribution by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and through the United Nations and other aid organizations\u2019 using the newly formed \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d the Israeli military put in place last week.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began distributing aid  in the enclave in late May, has been widely condemned for the hundreds of people killed, often by Israeli soldiers, near its aid sites, and for its limited distribution.",
      "Last Sunday, GHF distributed around 1 million meals and at least another 1.2 million from Monday to Wednesday, and 1.3 million on Thursday. GHF did not appear to publish the number of meals distributed on Friday, but on Saturday said it released at least 1.7 million meals.",
      "In a population of roughly 2 million people, that averages out to around half a meal to just under a full meal per person per day.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military branch responsible for overseeing aid into Gaza, said Sunday that a total of 1,200 aid trucks had entered the enclave over the past week and that the same number had been collected by the United Nations and other aid organizations. It said that \"hundreds of trucks remain inside Gaza\" and were still waiting to be picked up.",
      "Before Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza began, around 500 trucks carrying aid were entering the enclave daily, according to the British Red Cross and other organizations.",
      "The below graph shows how the amount of aid entering Gaza soared during the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas before it stopped during Israel's blockade, with only a trickle entering in the months after it was lifted.",
      "Asked for the number of trucks allowed into Gaza and collected by humanitarian groups on Friday and Saturday, COGAT did not immediately respond.",
      "While COGAT has shared information about trucks entering Gaza and being collected by aid groups on its social media pages over the past week, it has not updated its online dashboard for aid into Gaza since Monday, despite international focus on the matter.",
      "According to the World Food Program, only about two-thirds of the amount of food the U.N. organization has requested Israeli authorities allow into Gaza had been approved as of Thursday since the Israeli military began tactical pauses.",
      "How Israeli restrictions caused the hunger crisis",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza drastically worsened in March after Israel imposed a blockade barring the entry of aid into Gaza, in the midst of its ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Israel lifted the crippling blockade in May, but for months, it has allowed only a limited amount of aid to enter the enclave, most of which has been distributed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "COGAT did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation that the amount of aid entering Gaza is not enough. It has previously accused humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, of exacerbating hunger by failing to collect and distribute aid to Palestinians fast enough.",
      "However, humanitarian organizations have said efforts to distribute the limited aid they\u2019ve been able to get into Gaza has been hampered by Israeli restrictions. They\u2019ve also emphasized that even after Israel vowed to lift some restrictions last Sunday, the amount of aid entering the enclave remains limited.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A 12-year-old Chinese swimmer has become a global sensation with her history-making times, even as observers and fans back home caution against overhyping the young athlete.",
      "On Thursday, Yu Zidi became the youngest-ever medalist at the World Aquatics Championships, which are being held in Singapore this year. On Sunday, she finished fourth in the women's 400 individual medley final.",
      "Yu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women\u2019s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.",
      "\u201cI was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,\u201d Yu told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.\u201d",
      "The Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I thought: why not give training a try?\u201d Yu told Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in May.",
      "Yu, who is also the youngest person to medal at a major international competition since 1936, swims so fast that she qualified for the World Aquatics Championships even though the minimum age requirement is usually 14.",
      "She came close to medaling in three other events in Singapore, missing the podium by 0.06 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter medley Monday, 0.31 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter butterfly Thursday and 0.50 seconds in the women\u2019s 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.",
      "At the Chinese national championships in May, Yu finished the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 2:10.63, winning a silver medal and setting a world record in the event for any 12-year-old, male or female.",
      "Hailed as the world\u2019s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Canada\u2019s Summer McIntosh, who won four golds in Singapore including the 400-meter medley. Though Yu came in fourth, she is already swimming that event about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.",
      "Her stunning performance before she\u2019s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.",
      "But some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.",
      "Yu\u2019s sudden fame may expose her to \u201cdisproportionate\u201d pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,\u201d it said, adding that there is \u201cno need to rush into hero worship.\u201d",
      "The warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture.",
      "Success at the highest levels of sport has been central to China\u2019s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.",
      "But the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries\u2019 star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.",
      "Organized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.",
      "The new fans brought \u201csophisticated strategies\u201d from the entertainment industry, setting off \u201cfandom wars\u201d among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.",
      "China\u2019s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "When gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.",
      "Pan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.",
      "The Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.",
      "But sometimes the frenzy goes beyond the internet. Chinese table tennis player Fan Zhendong, an Olympic gold medalist, said he was traumatized when a stranger sneaked into his hotel room in 2023.",
      "\u201cI never thought, as an athlete, I would have to go through something like this,\u201d he told Phoenix TV last week, adding that organized online abuse had caused him \u201csevere\u201d mental stress that contributed to several unexpected losses.",
      "Since sports prodigies naturally attract followers, fan groups could also be a concern for Yu in the future, said Zhang, who was at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.",
      "China is often overprotective of its athletes, but it \u201cmay not be a good thing if Yu is living in isolation like protected giant pandas,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor athletes, learning to interact with the media is a necessary part of their development,\u201d Zhang added.",
      "Jessie Zhou, 23, a graduate student in Hong Kong who closely follows table tennis star Fan, said it was a \u201cgood call\u201d for Chinese media to cover Yu in a \u201crestrained tone\u201d while extreme sports fandom remains unresolved.",
      "\u201cJust let the kid stay focused on training,\u201d Zhou said."

      "Many Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have also voiced concern about the situation and are pushing the Trump administration to help broker a ceasefire agreement. Witkoff pulled the U.S. negotiating team out of Doha, Qatar, last week after he said Hamas showed \u201ca lack of desire\u201d to reach a deal.",

      "\u201cIncredible feat!\u201d Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, who accompanied Witkoff, said in a post on X on Friday, after touring GHF's operations and speaking to \"folks on the ground.\"",
      "Palestinians and others inside Gaza have criticized the visit as a public relations stunt for GHF, whose aid distribution process has been marked by chaos, looting and deadly shootings, often by Israeli soldiers, that have killed hundreds of hungry Palestinians seeking aid.",
      "\u201cIt was a PR stunt, a controlled visit supervised and dictated by the Israeli military,\u201d Ellie Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told NBC News' crew on the ground. \u201cWhat they saw was not the reality.\u201d",
      "Burgos had earlier called for Witkoff to visit Gaza, urging him to witness the conditions on the ground for himself, but felt his limited tour did little to change the situation on the ground.",
      "\u201cFood is still incredibly difficult to find, people are still being shot at aid distribution sites, and violence continues,\u201d she said.",
      "On the day of the visit, at least 92 people were killed on Friday across Gaza, including 51 people who were seeking aid, Dr. Mohammed Saqr, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News.",
      "Mohamed Saddak, 47, who was hoping to collect food for his family of nine, told NBC News' crew that tanks had advanced toward him and others as they sought to receive aid.",
      "\u201cThey are constantly shooting at us,\u201d he said, \u201cfiring from tanks, and sometimes by drones.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on the shootings at aid sites following Witkoff's visit.",
      "Israeli officials continued to deny claims of widespread hunger inside Gaza, though in a sign of shifting discourse, top U.S. officials have begun to acknowledge the crisis.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got little kids who are clearly starving to death,\u201d Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Monday.",
      "In a post on X, Witkoff said the visit's purpose was to give Trump a \"clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "After Gaza, Witkoff on Saturday visited Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where families of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas were demanding that the Israeli government secure a deal to release the remaining hostages. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "According to a statement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Witkoff told them, \u201cWe will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will do what\u2019s right for the Gazan people.\u201d",
      "The protests came after a video of an Israeli hostage in Gaza, Rom Braslavski, was released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad on Thursday. A day later, Hamas released a video of another Israeli hostage, Evyatar David, showing him alive but frail. It is unclear when the videos were filmed.",
      "\u201cWe cannot endure even one more minute without bringing him home,\u201d Braslavski\u2019s cousin Adam Hajaj said in a statement. \u201cThis video tore my family apart!\u201d",
      "Huckabee, meanwhile, hailed GHF's distribution of over a million meals a day, which at Gaza's population of roughly 2 million people averages to half a meal per person per day.",
      "GHF stepped in to distribute food in the weeks after Israel lifted its nearly three-month total blockade on all food and supplies entering the enclave. But the aid GHF distributed, alongside some limited quantities by other international organizations, fell far short of the needs of the population. Last Sunday, Israel said it was expanding aid access into Gaza after outrage mounted over the widespread starvation and surging deaths from malnutrition.",
      "GHF runs four aid sites in Gaza, and even though it claims independence from any government, it runs the sites inside Israel's militarized zone with the backing of the Israeli military.",
      "Witnesses and aid agencies have decried the aid delivery process, which, according to the U.N., has resulted in deaths of nearly 1,400 people while collecting aid, including 859 in the vicinity of the GHF sites.",
      "The Israeli military and the GHF have acknowledged that some shots have been fired but said only as warnings.",
      "\u201cUS-backed Israeli forces and private contractors have put in place a flawed, militarized aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths,\u201d New York-based Human Rights Watch said Friday.",
      "Burgos' colleague, Dr. Tom Adamkiewicz, urged the diplomats to see \"what\u2019s happening to the children, the families, to these young boys and women and men that are being basically shot at like rabbits.\""

      "\u201cPolitics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\u201d Uribe said after Friday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense\u2019s request because it would be \u201ceasy\u201d for the former president to leave the country to \u201cevade the imposed sanction.\u201d",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday\u2019s sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \u201cthink much more about the solution than the problem\u201d during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia\u2019s Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "Uribe in 2012 filed a libel suit against Cepeda in the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court in 2018 dismissed the accusations against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe.",
      "Martha Pe\u00f1uela Rosales, a supporter of Uribe\u2019s party in the capital, Bogota, said she wept and prayed after hearing of the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an unjust sentence. He deserves to be free,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Sergio Andr\u00e9s Parra, who protested against Uribe outside the courthouse, said the 12-year sentence \u201cis enough\u201d and, even if the former president appeals, \u201chistory has already condemned him.\u201d",
      "During Uribe\u2019s presidency, Colombia\u2019s military attained some of its biggest battlefield victories against Latin America\u2019s oldest leftist insurgency, pushing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into remote pockets and forcing the group\u2019s leadership into peace talks that led to the disarmament of more than 13,000 fighters in 2016."

      "A lion that was being tracked by Oxford University researchers in western Zimbabwe has been killed by a trophy hunter, in what one wildlife campaigner called a \u2018harrowing echo\u2019 of Cecil the Lion\u2019s death in 2015.",
      "Blondie, a tourist favorite, was hunted down after being lured and baited out of Gwayi Conservancy, near Hwange National Park, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH), an advocacy organization based in the U.K.",
      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",
      "The beloved feline was killed in late June but his death only began to garner international attention in the last week.",
      "Some 10,000 lions have been shot by trophy hunters in the last decade, according to CBTH, which said African lion populations have declined by more than 90% in the last century.",
      "The safari company Africa Geographic sponsored the GPS collar that was fitted on Blondie.",
      "Africa Geographic\u2019s CEO, Simon Epsley, said the organization was \u201cdismayed and angered\u201d at the killing.",
      "\u201cThat Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d he said.",
      "Collars are used to track the animals, limit wildlife-human conflict and support conservation.",
      "Zimbabwean law allows a maximum of 100 lions above the age of 6 to be hunted each year in the country, where safaris and big game hunting are important sources of income.",
      "A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks Agency, the government hunting regulator, denied that Blondie\u2019s killing had broken the law because he was older than 6.",
      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",
      "But Farawo denied that anything illegal happened, and said these sorts of hunts paid for conservation efforts.",
      "Born Free, another U.K.-based advocacy group, has expressed concern for Blondie\u2019s pride, saying the fate of its three female partners and a number of cubs was \u201cseriously in doubt.\u201d",
      "In 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer sparked outrage when he admittedly killed Cecil the Lion after paying $50,000 for the experience.",
      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",
      "After the worldwide outrage caused by Cecil\u2019s killing, Zimbabwean authorities vowed to crack down on trophy hunting  \u2014 but pressure groups say it hasn\u2019t worked.",
      "Mark Jones, Born Free\u2019s head of policy, said that that little has been learned since Cecil\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cThe very fact that they lure lions out of national parks suggests that there are no lions remaining in the hunting areas for them to hunt, reflecting the massive damage to lion populations that trophy hunting is doing,\u201d Jones said."

    "story": [
      "As deaths from starvation in the Gaza Strip continue to rise, experts say there\u2019s no easy way out of the crisis due to the medical complexity of treating severe malnutrition.",
      "More than 160 people \u2014 at least 90 of them children \u2014 have died of malnutrition since the war began, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "The world\u2019s leading body on hunger, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), says that nearly all of Gaza is suffering a food security crisis or worse, and more than half of the population is in the \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201ccatastrophe\u201d phase of starvation \u2014 which means recovering isn\u2019t as simple as giving starving people food.",
      "Rather, giving food to people experiencing such an extreme degree of starvation could kill them, experts say.",
      "\u201cIf you do what the body wants to do, which is to just drink and eat as much as possible the minute you see food, you can actually create these permanent imbalances that can cause things like heart failure or organ damage, because the body had to adapt to get to that starvation mode,\u201d NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel, an internal medicine doctor, said.",
      "At the most severe stages of starvation, even giving a person water can push their body into failure, Patel said.",
      "What happens to the body when it\u2019s starving?",
      "Humans can generally go without any food or water for several days because the body finds a way to adapt in order to survive. First by feeding off of so-called glycogen stores \u2014 a starchy substance from carbohydrates that\u2019s stored in the liver and muscles. The body stores about 1,700 to 2,200 calories\u2019 worth of energy as glycogen.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing your body goes for that can get you through without eating or any water for about several days, in some cases, maybe a little longer,\u201d Patel said.",
      "Once those glycogen stores are depleted, the body starts to break down fat for energy, but when that\u2019s gone, it turns to muscle. This is what causes the body to shrink and the starving person to assume a gaunt, hollow-cheeked look.Eventually the brain doesn\u2019t have the energy it needs to function, leading to irritability, mood swings and trouble concentrating.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to even just make sound judgments,\u201d Patel said. \u201cYou can see people have psychotic illusions. You can see people hearing things. All of that is basically the body\u2019s way of surviving.\u201d",
      "Most starving people die from infections as their immune system shuts down. Eventually, the heart will be affected, causing a person\u2019s blood pressure and pulse to drop. If they don\u2019t die from infection, the heart will shut down, doctors said.",
      "The more vulnerable parts of the population are likely to suffer the most. \u201cChildren \u2014 specifically infants \u2014 pregnant women, the elderly and people with certain kinds of chronic illness are the risk groups that we need to pay special attention to,\u201d said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.",
      "How is starvation treated?",
      "Patel said a good analogy to giving food to a starving person is a downpour after a drought. The land desperately needs water, but because it\u2019s so dry it repels water instead of absorbing it, leading to flash flooding. \u201cRefeeding\u201d after starvation needs to be managed clinically and by medical professionals.",
      "\u201cWhen a person has reached a state of starvation, the body undergoes extreme metabolic changes,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving too much food \u2014 or the wrong kind \u2014 too quickly can trigger a dangerous shift in fluids and electrolytes known as refeeding syndrome, which can be fatal if not carefully managed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA bag of flour \u2014 some of the only food aid that has gotten in recently \u2014 won\u2019t save anyone because it has none of the essential nutrients,\u201d said Dr. Nour Alamassi, a doctor and the medical team lead for Project HOPE, an international nongovernmental organization focused on global health and humanitarian aid.",
      "\u201cToo many carbs can actually be life-threatening for anyone with Severe Acute Malnourishment (SAM), and even for the average person in Gaza who has not had a regular diet in many months, it is very difficult to digest,\u201d Alamassi, who is caring for children and pregnant women in Gaza, wrote in an email.",
      "Ideally, doctors told NBC News, there would be enough medical staff to monitor the refeeding process for each person for a period stretching from weeks to even months. Children would be stabilized with fortified milks, which contain the nutrients that a malnourished child needs, and something called ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF), which are energy-dense, easy to digest and carefully balanced in the nutrients children need to start to recover. Doctors would draw blood to monitor sodium and potassium levels \u2014 if these electrolytes are too low or too high, it can be deadly.",
      "But the situation on the ground in Gaza is far from ideal. There are not enough doctors, not enough supplies and not the right supplies, experts say.",
      "\u201cThe aid blockade has prevented us from accessing the medications and nutrition supplies that are necessary to treat these people,\u201d Alamassi said. \u201cWe recently ran out of High Energy Biscuits (HEB) in our clinics, which really limits our ability to help patients. We hope to get more in the coming days, but each day without these supplies can make a major difference for a patient\u2019s outcome.\u201d",
      "What are the long-term effects of starvation?",
      "Even if refeeding is successful, people who survive starvation can experience physical and psychological effects for the rest of their lives, experts said. The damage, especially for young and very old victims, is permanent.",
      "In children, malnutrition can cause delays in both physical and cognitive development. Physically, they\u2019re more likely to have weakened immune systems, leading to a harder time recovering from infections. Malnourished children are also more likely to experience stunted growth, which can affect their height, muscle mass and bone density and even delay puberty, experts said.",
      "Cognitively, children can suffer from permanent brain damage due to iron and zinc deficiencies, affecting their ability to learn and problem solve.",
      "Alamassi said the hunger crisis in Gaza is affecting \u201can entire generation of children who will suffer lifelong consequences.\u201dThe recovery of adults from very severe malnutrition is not only possible, but likely, Redlener said.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s done right, most adults, unless they\u2019re really at a terminal stage of undernutrition, the refeeding will result in restoration of everything \u2014 a far different story than the ability for a young child with prolonged malnutrition, where it\u2019s often impossible to get a full recovery,\u201d he said.",
      "Patel said even people with a history of malnutrition are monitored over years to make sure their bodies are functioning properly.",
      "\u201cAs they age and develop, different parts of the body pull on memories of that nutrition depletion,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question we all have to ask ourselves is, how long are we going to be able to do this without having adequate support on the ground?\u201d"

      "Since late May, more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food, with 859 deaths \"in the vicinity\" of GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys,\" the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, said in a news release Thursday. It said most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.",
      "Witkoff and Huckabee made the trip as part of an effort by Washington to secure a plan to see more food delivered to Gaza as deaths from starvation in the enclave continue to rise, according to the White House.",
      "It was not clear how arrangements for the visit, including the meetings with local Palestinians in Gaza, were being arranged, with Israel having maintained strict control over access to Gaza throughout the war, barring international media and foreign officials from entering the territory independently.",
      "Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, condemned the visit, writing in a statement addressed to Witkoff: \"Gaza is not Animal Farm that needs a theatrical personal visit to take some pictures in front of the #Death_Factories that your American companies manage in collaboration with the fascist army of Israel.\"",
      "The trip comes as a growing number of Palestinians continue to die from starvation despite months of warnings from humanitarian groups about the impact of Israel\u2019s offensive and the strict aid restrictions it has upheld.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff and Huckabee would brief Trump \"immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "She said more details would be forthcoming once the plan was \"approved and agreed on by the president of the United States.\"",
      "Their visit to Gaza comes after Witkoff traveled to Israel and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday to address the dire humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Trump said earlier this week that \"real starvation\" was taking place, citing images he had seen on TV in a break with Netanyahu, who has denied there is starvation in the enclave and sought to blame Hamas for the crisis."

    "story": [
      "Russia claimed Thursday to have captured a key Ukrainian town after more than 16 months of intense fighting and unleashed a deadly seven-hour drone assault on Kyiv that offered no hint of its agreeing to President Donald Trump's demands to end its war.",
      "A Ukrainian military spokesman denied Moscow's claims that it had captured Chasiv Yar, saying Russian troops had only raised their flag over an already occupied part of the strategically important town.",
      "Showing no appetite for the ceasefire Trump has increasingly demanded, Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov hailed the \"courage of the paratroopers\" of the 98th Guards Airborne Division, which Moscow says carried out the seizure.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump \u2014 whose historical warmth toward Russian President Vladimir Putin has chilled significantly in recent weeks \u2014 said he would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Moscow if it did not agree to a peace plan in 10 days.",
      "While Russia was declaring victory in Chasiv Yar, it was launching hundreds of drones and missiles at Ukrainian civilians in Kyiv. It fired at least 308 drones and eight cruise missiles, according to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Most were shot down, but more than two dozen struck their targets, it said.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at least six people were killed, including a 6-year-old boy. The Ukrainian military announced later Thursday that the death toll from Russia\u2019s attacks in Kyiv had risen to 16.",
      "\u201cToday, the world again saw Russia\u2019s response to our desire for peace with America and Europe: new demonstrative killings,\u201d he said in his nightly address.",
      "Artemov Oleksandr, 40, a director at a bank in Kyiv, described the \"terrible reality\" visited upon Ukrainians.",
      "\"All night long, while this is happening, we were constantly texting,\" he said. \"Because in addition to some fears for ourselves, there are also many fears for our parents, for our relatives, maybe even more for them.\"",
      "He added, \"Unfortunately, this is such a terrible reality that no one wants to sleep with.\"",
      "Ukraine denies key town has fallen",
      "With a prewar population of just 12,000, Chasiv Yar today lies in ruins after more than a year of attritional warfare between the Russian invaders and Ukraine.",
      "Its significance owes to its key position en route to key \"fortress\" cities in the Donetsk region, including Kostiantynivka, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.",
      "Victor Trygubov, spokesman for Ukraine's troops in the Khortytsia region, denied that Russia had made the key gain.",
      "\"As usual, they once again raised a flag at the occupied part of the town, which they took about a half-year ago,\" he said, while spreading \"false information that they control all of the town.\"",
      "DeepState, a Ukrainian online monitoring platform that tracks the conflict using publicly available information, showed Thursday that while most of the town was under Russian occupation, part of it was grayed out, indicating it was under \"unknown\" control.",
      "It was not immediately possible to independently verify either side's statements.",
      "Dva Mayora, a Russian pro-war channel with 1.2 million subscribers on the messaging service Telegram, said the capture \"goes against Trump's political dancing.\"",
      "Chasiv Yar does include a hilltop from which troops can attack other key points in the region that form the backbone of Ukraine\u2019s eastern defenses, according to The Associated Press.",
      "But Sergey Markov, a former adviser to Putin who is now a pro-Kremlin commentator, said the town had \"no strategic significance\" and instead illustrated \"how this war can go on for many more years.\"",
      "Trump's ultimatums have also caused an online spat with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. After Trump called Medvedev a \"failed president\" who should \"watch his words,\" Medvedev red hit back.",
      "\"If a few words from a former Russian president can provoke such a nervous reaction from the sitting and supposedly formidable president of the United States, then clearly Russia is entirely in the right and will continue on its chosen path,\" said Medvedev, now a frequently outspoken Kremlin outrider online.",
      "He also referred to Russia's Soviet-era capability of launching a nuclear strike even if its armed forces and leadership are wiped out. Trump, he said, should \"recall just how dangerous the mythical 'Dead Hand' can be\" \u2014 a reference to the Western name for the technology."
