      "Mick Ralphs, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died",
      "Mick Ralphs, a guitarist, singer, songwriter and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died.",
      "A statement posted to Bad Company's official website Monday announced Ralphs' death at age 81. Ralphs had a stroke days after what would be his final performance with the band at London's O2 Arena in 2016, and had been bedridden ever since, the statement said. No further details on the circumstances of his death were provided.",
      "Ralphs is set to become a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bad Company in November.",
      "\u201cOur Mick has passed, my heart just hit the ground,\" Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cHe has left us with exceptional songs and memories. He was my friend, my songwriting partner, an amazing and versatile guitarist who had the greatest sense of humour.\u201d",
      "Ralphs wrote the 1970's song \u201cReady for Love\u201d for Mott the Hoople, later revamped for Bad Company's 1974 debut album, which also included the Ralphs-penned hit \u201cCan't Get Enough.\u201d He co-wrote Bad Company's 1975 classic \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d with Rodgers.",
      "Born in Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England, Ralphs began playing blues guitar as a teenager, and in his early 20s in 1966, he co-founded the Doc Thomas Group. In 1969, the band would become Mott the Hoople, a name taken from the title and title character of a 1966 novel by Willard Manus.",
      "The group's self-titled first album, recorded in a week, won a cult following, but the two that followed were critical and financial flops. They finally found popular success and became glam-rock giants with the 1972 David Bowie-penned-and-produced song \u201cAll the Young Dudes.\" But Ralphs felt creatively cramped in the band led by singer-songwriter Ian Hunter and left in 1973.",
      "He would soon form Bad Company with Rodgers, a singer who had left his own band, Free.",
      "The two had intended only to write songs together, and possibly to make a one-off album as a project. But when Free drummer Simon Kirke asked to sit in, they realized they were nearly a proper group already and went seeking a bassist. They found him in former King Crimson member Boz Burrell.",
      "\u201cWe didn't actually plan to have a band,\u201d Ralphs said in a 2015 interview with Gibson Guitars. \u201cIt was all kind of accidental I suppose. Lucky, really.\u201d",
      "Kirke said in a statement Monday that Ralphs was \u201ca dear friend, a wonderful songwriter, and an exceptional guitarist. We will miss him deeply.\"",
      "Bad Company found immediate success. its albums were full of radio-ready anthems, and its live sound was perfectly suited to the 1970s height of arena rock.",
      "Their self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. And Ralphs' \u201cCan't Get Enough\u201d \u2014 often mistakenly called \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough of Your Love\u201d because of its chorus lyrics \u2014 would be their biggest hit single, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
      "\u201cWe actually did the whole thing in one take live,\u201d Ralphs said in the Gibson interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we just said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s going to capture the moment.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like to do in recording. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect as long as it captures the moment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "Bad Company's 1975 follow-up, \u201cStraight Shooter,\u201d was also a hit, going to No. 3 on album charts in both the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and the UK Albums Chart.",
      "Its opening track, \u201cGood Lovin' Gone Bad,\u201d written by Ralphs, was a modest hit, and the song that followed it, \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love,\u201d was a big one that would remain in rotation on classic rock radio for decades.",
      "The band's statement says Ralphs is survived by \u201cthe love of his life,\u201d his wife Susie Chavasse, along with two children, three step-children and \u201cbeloved bandmates\u201d Rodgers and Kirke.",
      "\u201cOur last conversation a few days ago we shared a laugh,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be our last.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- Giorgio Armani\u2019s menswear collection for the next warm weather season encoded the geography of summer in textures, geometrical designs and his signature relaxed silhouettes.",
      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on livestream.",
      "It was the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",
      "The showroom was awash in Mediterranean blue and featured installations of obsidian black stones, reflecting the sophisticated color palette that included washed-out desert shades, the palest green, deep blues and urban blacks and gray.",
      "Front-row guests included actors Giancarlo Esposito, who most recently appeared in \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u2019\u2019 and Jason Isaacs, who was in the third season of \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",
      "\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dora. What\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.",
      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",
      "Nickelodeon is celebrating Dora\u2019s 25th anniversary with the feature-length live-action movie \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d a third season of the rebooted animated series \u201cDora,\u201d the podcast Dora\u2019s Mermaid Adventures, an album of songs and plenty of toys and apparel.",
      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",
      "\u201cDora the Explorer\u201d led to what Herles laughingly calls the \u201cDora-verse\u201d \u2014 the spinoff series \u201cGo, Diego, Go!,\u201d a sequel series \u201cDora and Friends: Into the City!\u201d and the 2019 live-action feature film \u201cDora and the Lost City of Gold,\u201d starring Isabela Merced, Eva Longoria and Michael Pe\u00f1a.",
      "\u201cDora\u201d co-creator Chris Gifford has watched his creation age up and down and take human form. \u201cShe has been older and she has been younger and she has a hair clip now,\u201d he says. \u201cHer essence, her positive spirit, her I-can-do-anything-with-your-help attitude has stuck through.\u201d",
      "Dora is firmly part of the culture, as big as her Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon. There's a reference to her in \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d she's been mocked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and if you look carefully at the PBS show \u201cAlma's Way,\u201d you can see a Dora doll in that heroine's bedroom. TikTok users have embraced the \u201cBackpack Song.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose kids coming of age now \u2014 the ones who 25 years ago were just watching it as little preschoolers \u2014 they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re remembering,\u201d says Valerie Walsh Valdes, co-creator of the original series and an executive producer on the new series and movie.",
      "Valdes and Gifford originally had the idea for a show about a little girl who was a problem solver. Like \u201cBlue's Clues,\u201d it would reward kids for figuring out answers posed by the host.",
      "\u201cPreschoolers are the least powerful people in our world,\u201d says Gifford. \u201cThey're not able to button their sweater and not able to tie their shoes, but if they\u2019re able to help Dora get to the City of Lost Toys and really feel like they helped, that\u2019s something special.\u201d",
      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "The University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy tackles some serious topics like how to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma",
      "CHICAGO -- Three dozen police captains pair off in a Chicago conference room to play a game: They must start a sentence with the last word their partner used.",
      "Many exchanges are nonsensical, full of one-upmanship using difficult words and laughter. But the improvisation game eventually makes sense.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do, is get you to listen to the end of the sentence,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, wrapping up the improvisational exercise. \u201cIf my arm was a sentence, when do most people stop listening? Always the elbow! But then you're missing everything that goes after... and sometimes that's critical information.\u201d",
      "The police captains who have flown in from departments across the country nod. \u201cI definitely do that,\" some call out.",
      "Officials at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy brought members of The Second City, Chicago's storied improv theater, to teach police leaders the more diverse skills found in improv exercises \u2014 like thinking on your feet, reserving judgment and fully listening.",
      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "In a note of condolences, Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli said Pomodoro's \u201cwounded\u201d spheres \u201cspeak to us today of the fragility and complexity of the human and the world.\u201d",
      "The Vatican\u2019s sphere, which occupies a central place in the Pigna Courtyard of the Vatican Museums, features an internal mechanism that rotates with the wind. \u201cIn my work I see the cracks, the eroded parts, the destructive potential that emerges from our time of disillusionment,\u201d the Vatican quoted Pomodoro as saying about its sphere.",
      "The United Nations in New York received a 3.3-meter (10 foot, eight inch) diameter \u201cSphere Within Sphere\u201d sculpture as a gift from Italy in 1996. The U.N. sphere has refers to the coming of the new millennium, the U.N. said: \u201ca smooth exterior womb erupted by complex interior forms,\u201d and \u201ca promise for the rebirth of a less troubled and destructive world,\u201d Pomodoro said of it.",
      "Other spheres are located at museums around the world and outside the Italian foreign ministry, which has the original work that Pomodoro created in 1966 for the Montreal Expo that began his monumental sculpture project.",
      "Pomodoro was born in Montefeltro, Italy, on June 23, 1926. In addition to his spheres, he designed theatrical sets, land projects and machines. He had multiple retrospectives and taught at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and Mills College, according to his biography on the foundation website.",

The Walt Disney Co. animation studio has often launched some of its biggest titles in June, including \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d But \u201cElio,\u201d a science fiction adventure about a boy who dreams of meeting aliens, notched a modest $21 million, the lowest opening ever for Pixar.",
      "\u201cThis is a weak opening for a new Pixar movie,\u201d said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe. \u201cThese would be solid numbers for another original animation film, but this is Pixar, and by Pixar\u2019s remarkable standard, the opening is well below average.\u201d",
      "\u201cElio,\u201d originally set for release in early 2024, had a bumpy road to the screen. Adrian Molina \u2014 co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d \u2014 was replaced mid-production by Domee Shi (\u201cTurning Red\u201d) and Madeline Sharafian. Back at Disney\u2019s D23 conference in 2022, America Ferrera appeared to announce her role as Elio\u2019s mother, but the character doesn\u2019t even exist in the revamped film.",
      "Disney and Pixar spent at least $150 million making \u201cElio,\u201d which didn\u2019t fare any better internationally than it did in North America, bringing in just $14 million from 43 territories. Pixar stumbled coming out of the pandemic before stabilizing performance with 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($496.4 million worldwide) and 2024\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.7 billion), which was the company's biggest box office hit.",
      "\u201cElemental\u201d was Pixar's previously lowest earning film, launching with $29.6 million. It rallied in later weeks to collect nearly half a billion dollars at the box office. The company's first movie, \u201cToy Story,\u201d opened with $29.1 million in 1995, or $60 when adjusted for inflation. It remains to be seen whether \u201cElio's\u201d decent reviews and \u201cA\u201d from CinemaScore audiences can lead it to repeat \u201cElemental's\u201d trajectory.",
      "With most schools on summer break, the competition for family audiences was stiff. Disney\u2019s own \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d another live-action remake, continued to pull in young moviegoers. It grossed $9.7 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its global tally to $910.3 million. .",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d signaled the return of another, far gorier franchise. Director Danny Boyle reunited with screenwriter Alex Garland to resume their pandemic apocalypse thriller 25 years after \u201c28 Days Later\u201d and 18 years after its sequel, \u201c28 Weeks Later.\u201d",
      "The Sony Pictures release opened with $30 million. That was good enough to give Boyle, the filmmaker of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d the biggest opening weekend of his career. The film, which cost $60 million to make, jumps ahead nearly three decades from the outbreak of the so-called rage virus for a coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old (Alfie Williams) venturing out of his family\u2019s protected village. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes co-star.",
      "Reviews have been good (90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) for \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d though audience reaction (a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore) is mixed. Boyle has more plans for the zombie franchise, which will next see the release of \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d next year from director Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d added another $30 million in 59 overseas markets.",
      "After its strong start last weekend with $12 million, A24\u2019s \u201cMaterialists\u201d held well with $5.8 million in its second weekend. The romantic drama by writer-director Celine Song and starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans has collected $24 million so far.",
      "Next weekend should also be a competitive one in movie theaters, with both \u201cF1,\u201d from Apple and Warner Bros., and Universal\u2019s \u201cMegan 2.0\u201d launching in cinemas.",

      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- A judge has denied singer R. Kelly 's request to be freed from prison, saying she lacks jurisdiction to consider the convicted sex offender's allegations that federal prison officials plotted to murder him.",
      "U.S. District Judge Martha M. Pacold canceled Friday's scheduled arguments in Chicago, and instead issued a five-page ruling denying his emergency request to serve his time on home detention during a temporary furlough.",
      "Born Robert Sylvester Kelly, the 58-year-old Grammy-winning R&B singer is serving sentences at a prison in Butner, North Carolina, for child sex crimes and racketeering.",
      "Pacold noted that federal courts have only limited power in such cases, and one by one she examined and rejected various ways Kelly's request could be considered.",
      "\u201cJurisdictional limitations must be respected even where, as here, a litigant claims that the circumstances are extraordinary,\u201d Pacold wrote. \"Kelly has not identified (nor is the court aware of) any statute or rule that authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction. Thus, the court cannot award relief in this case.\u201d",
      "Kelly claimed in a series of filings this month that prison officials solicited white supremacist leaders to kill him, to halt the disclosure of information damaging to prison officials.",
      "Kelly's attorney says he was then moved to solitary confinement and purposely given an overdose of medication, which required hospitalization and surgery for blood clots.",

      "Known for such hits as \u201cI Believe I Can Fly,\u201d Kelly was found guilty in Chicago in 2022 of three charges of producing child sexual abuse images and three charges of enticement of minors for sex. In New York in 2021, he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. He is serving most of his 20-year Chicago sentence and 30-year New York sentence simultaneously.",
      "His appeals have been unsuccessful, including to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kelly has also sought President Donald Trump\u2019s help.",

    "story": [
      "Keke Palmer is giving her take on her 2023 public breakup with her ex Darius Jackson on her new album, \u2018Just Keke",
      "NEW YORK -- A sheer dress silhouetting a black body suit, Usher\u2019s signature crowd interaction and a tweet from her child\u2019s father: that concoction created a nearly two-week social media frenzy starring Keke Palmer back in 2023. Now, the multi-hyphenate creative has channeled that experience into her new album, \u201cJust Keke.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was tough \u2026 I didn\u2019t even realize I was in such grief,\u201d said the 31-year-old about the fallout of her extremely public breakup with her ex, Darius Jackson. \u201cI get to put that same emotion into a song, and I get tell those people that\u2019s been watching me since I was nine \u2026 what\u2019s going on in a way that it can translate.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s \u201cBig Boss,\u201d her third solo studio project, out now, is an 18-track visual album conceptualized and directed by Palmer and her team. Tayla Parx, who\u2019s written for Alicia Keys, Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, handled the bulk of the writing and executive produced with Palmer. The storyline follows Palmer musically navigating celebrity, motherhood and self-reflection. But her vulnerability about her well-publicized relationship drama is the album\u2019s throughline.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what artistry is \u2026 mine is about transmutation, it\u2019s about bringing closure,\u201d said Palmer, who\u2019s usually mum about her romantic relationships. \u201cI have to address something that I would never address, especially nothing on an intimate level \u2014 that\u2019s just so not me. But I knew that I had to because now that it\u2019s become public, it\u2019s become a part of my work, and I have to respond to it as such. And that just caused me to have to grow.\u201d",
      "While attending Usher\u2019s popular Las Vegas residency in 2023, the Emmy winner danced closely with the music icon during his routine audience interaction segment. Social videos of the interaction prompted a viral tweet from Jackson, her ex-boyfriend and child\u2019s father, criticizing her attire, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s the outfit tho.. you a mom.\u201d",
      "While he was quickly admonished online, the conversation eventually moved beyond social media to articles and think pieces tackling subjects ranging from patriarchy, women\u2019s attire, and having children before marriage.",
      "Standout tracks on \u201cJust Keke\u201d include \u201cMy Confession\u201d \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek interpolation of Usher\u2019s hit \"Confessions, Pt. II\" \u2014 as well as the previously released \"125 Degrees\u201d and \u201cOff Script.\u201d She passionately belts out her love on the ballad \u201cUnless It\u2019s You,\u201d while \u201cMisunderstood\u201d finds her asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you see me throwing out a lifeline? / You too busy pinning me the bad guy / Maybe we ain\u2019t doing what we should / or maybe we\u2019re just misunderstood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the project, I think, speaks to as well is just like reclamation,\u201d said the \u201cNope\u201d star, admitting the album could reignite criticism about her personal life. \u201cI\u2019m just Keke, hate it or love it. This is me, this is my story, this is how I see things, I see my life \u2026 the whole point of it, too, is making peace with just saying what you got to say and letting it be that.\u201d",
      "While Palmer\u2019s mic is still hot, she\u2019s extremely booked and busy on Hollywood lots: a sequel to \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d and she stars with Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson in \u201cThe Pickup\u201d from Prime Video in August. The \u201cAkeelah and the Bee\u201d actor will lead Peacock\u2019s upcoming TV adaptation of Mel Brook\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs,\u201d and she\u2019ll join the team on \u201cSpaceballs 2\u201d with original stars Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis, the latter a reclusive \u201880s and \u201990s star who\u2019s since largely stayed out of Hollywood.",
      "Palmer says she\u2019ll judge the success of \u201cJust Keke\u201d not necessarily by sales or Billboard charts, but by potential opportunities that arise, whether it\u2019s creating and directing visual albums for other artists, helming her own musical and comedic variety show, or even embarking on her own world tour.",
      "\u201cIt could look like so many things, and I\u2019m open to all of them,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAs long as I know that I put my all into this, I know I can\u2019t lose.\u201d",

      "Trailblazing deaf actor Marlee Matlin opens up in the new documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "When American Masters approached Marlee Matlin about doing a documentary, Matlin had one name in mind to direct: Shoshanna Stern.",
      "Like Matlin, Stern is deaf. She also hadn\u2019t directed before. But Matlin, who herself became the first deaf person in the Directors Guild of America just a few years ago, was certain she was up to the task.",
      "The resulting film, \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a \u201cpity vote\u201d; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "It\u2019s also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.",
      "While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later,\u201d on some level it wasn\u2019t a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe communicate visually,\u201d she said.",
      "Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the \u201cCODA\u201d effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn\u2019t realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we\u2019re using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.",
      "We wouldn\u2019t do justice to Marlee\u2019s life if I had forced this form that really wasn\u2019t rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.",
      "MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.",
      "STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.",
      "MATLIN: \u201cCODA\u201d certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can\u2019t just turn it off.",
      "And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we\u2019re talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you\u2019re talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we \u201cexist,\u201d that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So \u201cCODA\u201d really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn\u2019t really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don\u2019t give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.",
      "STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, \u201cIt won\u2019t last.\u201d The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if we have movement.",
      "MATLIN: There\u2019s so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.",
      "I\u2019d like to see action because I\u2019ve been hearing that, \u201cYes, we have to do this\u201d or \u201cI will do this,\u201d but it\u2019s been 40 years. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.",
      "I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I\u2019d love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, \"Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.\"",
      "That\u2019s just one example of the things I\u2019d like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.",

The song\u2019s success was followed by a performance at the American Music Awards, further fueling their international fan base.",

At the height of their popularity, BTS was not only the biggest K-pop group on the planet, but the biggest boy band overall.",

      "BTS has also been nominated for five Grammy Awards. Their first, for \u201cDynamite\u201d in the best pop duo/group performance category, marked the first time a K-pop act received a Grammy nod.",
      "As their global popularity grew, the septet also became international advocates for social justice. Their 2018 address to the United Nations General Assembly launched the \u201cLove Myself\u201d campaign in partnership with UNICEF to combat violence, abuse and bullying while promoting self-esteem among young people. The group\u2019s commitment to human rights activism continued in 2020 when they donated $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement, denouncing racial discrimination and violence.

      "His battered military hat. A sleeve from his red velvet coat. Even the divorce papers that ended one of history\u2019s most tormented romances \u2014 with Josephine, the empress who haunted him to the end.",
      "Two centuries after his downfall, Napoleon remains both revered and controversial in France \u2014 but above all, unavoidable. Polls have shown that many admire his vision and achievements, while others condemn his wars and authoritarian rule. Nearly all agree his legacy still shapes the nation.",
      "\u201cThese are not just museum pieces. They\u2019re fragments of a life that changed history,\u201d said Louis-Xavier Joseph, Sotheby\u2019s head of European furniture, who helped assemble the trove. \u201cYou can literally hold a piece of Napoleon\u2019s world in your hand.\u201d",
      "The auction \u2014 aiming to make in excess of 7 million euros ($7.5 million) \u2014 is a biography in objects. The centerpiece is Napoleon\u2019s iconic bicorne hat, the black felt chapeau he wore in battle \u2014 with wings parallel to his shoulders \u2014 so soldiers and enemies could spot him instantly through the gunpowder haze.",
      "\u201cPut a bicorne on a table, and people think of Napoleon immediately,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the laurel crown of Julius Caesar.\u201d",
      "The hat is estimated to sell for at least over half a million dollars.",
      "For all the pageantry \u2014 throne, swords, the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor \u2014 the auction's true power comes from its intimacy. It includes the handwritten codicil of Napoleon's final will, composed in paranoia and illness on Saint Helena.",
      "There is the heartbreakingly personal: the red portfolio that once contained his divorce decree from Josephine, the religious marriage certificate that formalized their love and a dressing table designed for the empress. Her famed mirror reflects the ambition and tragedy of their alliance.",
      "\u201cNapoleon was a great lover; his letters that he wrote are full of fervor, of love, of passion,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt was also a man who paid attention to his image. Maybe one of the first to be so careful of his image, both public and private.\u201d",
      "The auction's timing is cinematic. The 2023 biopic grossed over $220 million worldwide and reanimated Napoleon\u2019s myth for a TikTok generation hungry for stories of ambition, downfall and doomed romance.",
      "The auction preview is open to the public, running through June 24, with the auction set for June 25.",
      "Not far from the Arc de Triomphe monument dedicated to the general's victories, Djamal Oussedik, 22, shrugged: \u201cEveryone grows up with Napoleon, for better or worse. Some people admire him, others blame him for everything. But to see his hat and his bed, you remember he was a real man, not just a legend.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t escape him, even if you wanted to. He\u2019s part of being French,\" said teacher Laure Mallet, 51.",
      "The exhibition is a spectacle crafted by celebrity designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, famed for dressing Lady Gaga and Pope John Paul II.",
      "\u201cI wanted to electrify history,\u201d Castelbajac said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a mausoleum, it\u2019s a pop culture installation. Today\u2019s collectors buy a Napoleon artifact the way they\u2019d buy a guitar from Jimi Hendrix. They want a cabinet of curiosities.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s filled the show with fog, hypnotic music and immersive rooms. One is inspired by the camouflage colors of Fontainebleau. Another is anchored by Napoleon\u2019s legendary folding bed. \u201cI create the fog in the entrance of the Sotheby\u2019s building because the elements of nature were an accomplice to Napoleon\u2019s strategy,\u201d the designer said.",
      "Castelbajac, who said his ancestor fought in Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign, brought a personal touch. \u201cI covered the emperor\u2019s bed in original canvas. You can feel he was just alone, facing all he had built. There\u2019s a ghostly presence.\"",
      "He even created something Napoleon only dreamed of. \u201cNapoleon always wanted a green flag instead of the blue, white, red tricolore of the revolution,\" he said, smiling. \"He never got one. So I made it for Sotheby\u2019s.\u201d",

      "In the early days of Israel's attack on Iran, U.S.-operated Radio Farda, which broadcasts in the Persian language in Iran, debunked a state media report that an Israeli pilot had been shot down and captured.",
      "Its journalism has continued despite the Trump administration's threat to its future, along with a Persian-language television outlet run by Voice of America.",
      "Radio Farda, a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and based in Prague, has continued broadcasting even though its managing editor estimated that more than half of its staff had been furloughed. VOA's Persian staff, ordered to go on administrative leave in March, were suddenly ordered back to work last Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe've been giving information to Iranians minute by minute about the conflict,\u201d said Golnaz Esfandiani, managing editor of Radio Farda. That includes explanatory stories about Iran's nuclear program and short videos posted on social media, she said.",
      "Several Iranians have contacted the radio network to express appreciation for reporting that they do not get on Iranian state media, she said. At the same time, families in Iran of five Radio Farda staff members have been pressured by people in the government who want to see the broadcasts stopped, she said.",
      "Through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Trump administration has sought to dismantle or sharply curtail the government-funded outlets that provide news reports to countries where there isn't a tradition of free press. The administration says these services operate with a liberal bias.",
      "Both Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are fighting the efforts in court.",
      "Employees at Voice of America's Persian service were notified in an email last Friday from Crystal Thomas, USAGM's human resources director, that they were being recalled and needed to report to work immediately.",

      "One person who got that email was at the office within three hours and worked until midnight, helping to put out a one-hour broadcast, said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the press. About 50 people have returned to work. Voice of America is banned in Iran, but many of its citizens find ways through the internet to bypass the ban.",
      "Voice of America's broadcasts \u2014 and social media posts \u2014 have become a challenge to produce because the administration has canceled subscriptions to news services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, said a second employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the employees, it's a stressful time, putting out urgent news reports without any sense of how long \u2014 or whether \u2014 they will continue to have a job.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful they've brought back our Persian service to continue their role as a trusted voice covering the region for the Iranian people,\u201d said Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House correspondent, who is a plaintiff in the court fight to keep the agency alive.",
      "\u201cBut why smash a working system only to cobble it back together when you realize you need it?\u201d Widakuswara asked. \u201cAnd how many crises would it take for them to realize that all VOA language services are important \u2014 before, after and during breaking news?\u201d",
      "During video reports posted online this week, a Voice of America anchor explained where Iranian counterattacks were landing in Israel, and how Iranians were trying to send out information about what is happening through social media.",
      "The danger for a service like VOA, having been off the air and off social media for more than two months, is that Iranian citizens will become accustomed to looking elsewhere for news, said Tom Kent, a media consultant and former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "\u201cYou would hope that people would learn from this that international broadcasting cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb,\u201d said Kent, also a former AP editor.",

      "Radio Farda has stayed on the air despite cutbacks. It also continues to have access to news services like the AP, but those contracts will expire at the end of the month, Esfandiani said. Three people have been brought back from furlough to help cover the war, she said.",
      "She said she hopes the conflict lets people who question the service's existence know its value.",
      "\u201cIt's an information war, absolutely,\u201d Esfandiani said. \u201cThese countries \u2014 Iran, Russia and China \u2014 would be very happy if we were gone.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one",
      "Most movies are lucky to predict one thing. Danny Boyle\u2019s 2002 dystopian thriller \u201c28 Days Later\u201d managed to be on the cutting edge of two trends, albeit rather disparate ones: global pandemic and fleet-footed zombies.",
      "Add in Cillian Murphy, who had his breakout role in that film, and \u201c28 Days Later\u201d was unusually prognostic. While many of us were following the beginnings of the Afghanistan War and \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland were probing the the fragile fabric of society, and the potentially very quick way, indeed, horror might come our way.",
      "Boyle always maintained that his undead \u2014 a far speedier variety of the slow-stepping monsters of George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cThe Night of Living Dad\u201d \u2014 weren\u2019t zombies, at all, but were simply the infected. In that film, and its 2007 sequel \u201c28 Weeks Later\u201d (which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helmed), the filmmakers have followed the fallout of the so-called rage virus, which emptied London in the first film and brought soon-dashed hopes of the virus\u2019 eradication in the second movie.",
      "Like the virus, the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d franchise has proven tough to beat back. In the new \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d Boyle and Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one. But recent history plays a surprisingly minor role in this far-from-typical, willfully shambolic, intensely scattershot part three.",
      "The usual trend of franchises is to progressively add gloss and scale. But where other franchises might have gone global, \u201c28 Years Later\u201d has remained in the U.K., now a quarantine region where the infected roam free and survivors \u2014 or at least the ones we follow \u2014 cluster on an island off the northeast of Britain, connected to mainland by only a stone causeway that dips below the water at high tide.",
      "Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who innovatively employed digital video in \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d have also turned to iPhones to shoot the majority of the film. Boyle, the \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201cTrainspotting\u201d filmmaker, is an especially frenetic director to begin with, but \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is frequently gratingly disjointed.",
      "It\u2019s a visual approach that, taken with the story\u2019s tonal extremes, makes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d an often bumpy ride. But even when Boyle\u2019s film struggles to put the pieces together, there\u2019s an admirable resistance to being anything like a cardboard cutout summer movie.",
      "The recent event that hovers over \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is less the COVID-19 pandemic than Brexit. With the virus quarantined on Britain, the country has been severed from the European continent. On the secluded Holy Island, 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams, a newcomer with some sweetness and pluck) lives with his hunter father, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and bedridden mother, Isla (Jodie Comer).",
      "The scene, with makeshift watchtowers and bows and arrows for weapons, is almost medieval. Jamie, too, feels almost like a knight eager to induct his son into the village\u2019s ways of survival. On Spike\u2019s first trip out off the island, his father \u2014 nauseatingly jocular \u2014 helps him kill his first infected. Back inside the village walls, Jamie celebrates their near scrapes and exaggerates his son\u2019s coolness under pressure. Other developments cause Spike to question the macho world he\u2019s being raised in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all lyin\u2019, mum,\u201d he says to his mother.",
      "After hearing of a far-off, supposedly deranged doctor whose constant fires mystify the townspeople, Spike resolves to take his mother to him in hopes of healing her unknown illness. Their encounters along the way are colorful. Ralph Fiennes plays the doctor, orange-colored when they encounter him; Edvin Ryding plays a Swedish NATO soldier whose patrol boat crashed offshore. Meanwhile, Comer is almost comically delusional, frequently calling her son \u201cDaddy.\u201d",
      "And the infected? One development here is that, while some remain Olympic-worthy sprinters, other slothful ones nicknamed \u201cSlow-Lows\u201d crawl around on the ground, rummaging for worms.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Jeezy released his commercial debut two decades ago, he prepared a contingency plan in case his musical aspirations weren\u2019t achieved.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around in 20 years,\u201d said the drug dealer-turned-rap legend. \u201cThe streets change fast. But it\u2019s also a safe haven, too, \u2019cause it was like, \u2018OK, well, if it doesn\u2019t work, maybe I can go back.\u2019\u201d",
      "But there would be no need: \u201cLet\u2019s Get It: Thug Motivation 101\u201d was met with monumental success. The album, deemed a classic by critics and fans, detailed the Atlanta rapper\u2019s navigation of the drug trade and street life. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with singles like \u201cSoul Survivor\u201d featuring Akon \u2014 which reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 \u2014 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d featuring a Jay-Z verse many consider one of his greatest.",
      "With distinctive ad-libs as memorable as his vivid storytelling, Jeezy displayed his gift of motivation, inspiring a vast cross-section of fans.",
      "\u201cThe music and the words resonated so well because they came from a real place. I wasn\u2019t trying to entertain \u2014 I was trying to reach,\" said the \u201cMy President\u201d rapper, who has built a business empire consisting of real estate and partnerships.",
      "In honor of the album's 20th anniversary, Jeezy is launching his \u201cTM:101 Live\u201d tour on June 27 in Miami, encouraging fans to come sharply dressed for the upscale performances. The Color of Noize Orchestra will back him, along with guest DJ Drama from their acclaimed \u201cTrap or Die\u201d mixtape.",
      "Jeezy spoke with the Associated Press about the album's legacy, social media discourse surrounding him and ex-wife Jeannie Mai, and his infamous snowman shirts that were banned at schools over accusations of promoting drug culture. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "JEEZY: I just had this feeling that \u2014 if I could just get it out \u2014 that it would be life-changing for me. So, there was a lot of things I was up against at that time and I must say personally, that was probably the most adversity I ever faced. \u2026 I tore my vocal cords because I had polyps on my vocal cords and didn\u2019t know it. And then around the same time, I was hit with Bell\u2019s palsy. And around that time, the album got leaked.",
      "If you\u2019re doing something to change your life and you know that the only other avenues are prison or death, you\u2019re just like, \u201cThis gotta work.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: Samuel L. Jackson told me something a long time ago \u2014 a great friend of mine \u2014 he just said the snowman represents people that were demonized, and it was bigger than me. \u2026 It was this imagery of something that I was inspiring to be. And to know that they would suspend kids from school and keep them from wearing something that would represent that tells me that the message was loud and clear. \u2026 \u201cWe got a people\u2019s champ.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: It\u2019s like a tree: It grows where it\u2019s soft at, not where it is hard. It\u2019s just like over time, leaves fall off, branches fall off but the tree continues to grow.",
      "Everybody don\u2019t have the same vision or goals. And if you allow them, they\u2019ll sink the ship \u2014 or they\u2019ll chop down the tree.",
      "JEEZY: I just live my life, man. You know, joy, peace, and freedom, brother. I don\u2019t know these people, so I can\u2019t even feel no type of way. That\u2019s on them \u2014 I got better things to do. I\u2019ve got goals, dreams, aspirations, so I don\u2019t get caught up in it, \u2019cause I don\u2019t go for the good, either. \u2026 I\u2019m not reading the comments to see what somebody said about me good, because none of it matters.",
      "JEEZY: I do want to shout out LISC (Local Initiatives Support Corporation) which is my partner on my nonprofit space. They\u2019re amazing. We\u2019re actually focusing in on prostate cancer, and then also helping the inner city youth with education, entrepreneurship. ... I\u2019d like to shout out the Urban League of Atlanta, and we have the Young CEOs program.",
      "It\u2019s great to put out projects, it\u2019s great to do tours. But it\u2019s also great to help your people in the process.",

      "After Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral controversial performance at Dodger Stadium, Dodgers fans have grown frustrated over the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for local immigrant communities impacted by the rise of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enfo...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out \u2014 in Spanish.",
      "Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.",
      "Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.",
      "Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.",
      "\u201cThis is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that\u2019s happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,\u201d the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press.",
      "The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI am saddened and infuriated by what\u2019s happening in our country and our city,\u201d he said in a post in English and Spanish. \u201cI cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.\u201d",
      "In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, \u201cWe are going to do the song in English today, so I\u2019m not sure if that wasn\u2019t transferred or if that wasn\u2019t relayed.\u201d She\u2019s received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,\u201d said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story.",
      "The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.",
      "Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: \u201cThere were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.\u201d",
      "Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles.",
      "Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city \u2014 the team still sells special \u201cLos Dodgers\u201d jerseys on its official website \u2014 and attend the stadium\u2019s multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.",
      "The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball\u2019s first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues).",
      "But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team\u2019s forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.",
      "Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they\u2019d be willing to return if the team spoke out.",
      "\u201cWe love you. You\u2019ve been so much a big part of our lives. \u2026 We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?\u201d asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.",
      "Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.",
      "\u201cNobody is messing around about this,\u201d said Murray. \u201cLos Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.\u201d",
      "Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.",
      "Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn\u2019t believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?\u201d she said.",
      "Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on the front and \u201cFDT\u201d \u2014 an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump \u2014 on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,\u2019\u201d said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.",
      "Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with \u201cICE\u201d crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.",
      "When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team \u201cdoes not allow signs or banners of any kind.\u201d Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem \u2014 at their sole discretion \u2014 to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group.",
      "Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gotta be the voice right now.\u201d",

      "North Carolina alt-country indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting",
      "NEW YORK -- A pit bull puppy peeing off a balcony. Mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail. Pink boiled eggs stay afloat in the brine. For its dedicated audience, the North Carolina alt-country-meets-indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting, where whole worlds are found in short lyrical lines.",
      "And that says nothing of what they sound like. The most exciting band in contemporary indie rock is informed by Drive-By Truckers and Pavement in equal measure, a distinctive sonic fabric of lap steel, guitar fuzz, folksy and jagged vocals.",
      "On Sept. 19, they will release their sixth and most ambitious full-length, \u201cBleeds.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy songwriting is just better on this album,\u201d Wednesday's singer and songwriter Karly Hartzman explains. \u201cThings are said more succinctly ... the immediacy of these songs was the main growth.\u201d",
      "Wednesday began as Hartzman's solo project, evidenced in 2018's sweet-sounding \u201cyep definitely.\u201d They became a full band on 2020's \u201cI Was Trying to Describe You to Someone,\u201d a dive into guitar distortions, and 2021's \u201cTwin Plagues,\u201d a further refinement of their \u201ccreek rock\u201d sound. The lineup consists of Hartzman, bassist Margo Schulz, lap steel player Xandy Chelmis, guitarist Jake Lenderman and drummer Alan Miller. Some also tour with Lenderman's solo project, MJ Lenderman. (Hartzman and Lenderman previously dated.)",
      "Wednesday's last album, the narrative \u201cRat Saw God,\u201d was named one of the best albums of 2023 by The Associated Press partially for its uncanny ability to dive into the particularities and complications of Southern identity. \u201cBleeds\u201d sharpens those tools.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I was going to call it \u2018Carolina Girl\u2019 but my bandmates did not like that,'\u201d Hartzman jokes.",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d comes from the explosive opening track, \u201cReality TV Argument Bleeds.\u201d",
      "She likes how the band name and album title sound together \u2014 \u201c'Wednesday Bleeds,' which I feel like I do, when I play music ... I'm almost, in a way, bloodletting and exorcising a demon.\u201d",
      "Lyrically, \u201cBleeds\u201d features some of Wednesday's best work \u2014 even in the revisiting of an older song, \u201cPhish Pepsi,\u201d that hilariously references both the jam band and the most disturbing movie released in 2010 \u2014 a kind of specificity born from Hartzman's writing practices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she and Lenderman \u201cwrote 20 lines of writing each day,\u201d a practice adopted from Silver Jews' David Berman. She's also a documentarian of memory: She takes notes of things her friends say and images that are affecting, to later collage them together in songs.",
      "\u201cThe well never runs dry,\u201d Hartzman says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve admitted not everything can come from inside. I need to look outward outside of myself for inspiration.\u201d",
      "Remembering, she says, \u201cis the goal for most of the (expletive) I do. ... I care. I want stories to persist.\u201d",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d manages cohesion across a variance of sound. \u201cWasp\u201d is hard-core catharsis; lead single \u201cElderberry Wine\u201d drops guitar noise for shimmery, fermented country. \u201cWound Up Here (By Holding On),\u201d which references the Appalachian poet Evan Gray, is a pretty indie rock track about a hometown hero who drowns.",
      "The quietest moment on the album, the plucked \u201cThe Way Love Goes,\u201d was written as \u201ca love song for Jake when we were still together. \u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 as well.'\u201d Hartzman explains. \u201c\u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 is kind of talking about me noticing slight changes in a relationship.\u201d",
      "These are not breakup songs; they exist right before the point of dissolution. \u201cSweet song is a long con / I drove ya to the airport with the E-brake on,\u201d she sings on the latter.",
      "Later: \u201cSometimes in my head I give up and / Flip the board completely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m understanding how sound creates emotion. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning over time,\u201d Hartzman says of her musical growth. \u201cI\u2019m also listening to more music with every year that passes. So, my understanding of what\u2019s possible, or what I can be inspired by, shifts.\u201d",
      "A number of the songs pull from childhood memory, as they always have across Wednesday's discography. \u201cI think about growing up a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of trying to tell ... a story that\u2019s vivid and intense, that\u2019s just the easiest time in my life, where everything felt vivid and intense.\u201d",
      "Longtime fans of the band will find recurring themes and characters from past songs. For example, \u201cGary's\u201d from their 2021 album returns as the \u201cBleeds\u201d closer in \u201cGary\u2019s II,\u201d where he gets into a bar fight.",
      "\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m writing the same songs over and over, but I\u2019m just trying to make them better,\u201d she says.",
      "There is always more humanity to excavate. And often, those emotions, \u201cthey aren't done with you,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey're not letting you go.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeff Ross, a comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer, more intimate side.",
      "\u201cThe hard part for me is letting go of a bit of my armor \u2014 of my roastmaster persona \u2014 and letting the audience get to me so that I can then get them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to change it up and surprise people.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d will play the Nederlander Theatre starting Aug. 5 for an eight-week engagement through Sept. 29.",
      "The show will explore Ross' close relatives, especially his grandfather on his mother's side \u2014 Ross calls him \u201cthe hero of my childhood\u201d \u2014 who stepped up after the comedian's parents died when he was a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very autobiographical, but it\u2019s also not really about just me. It\u2019s about all of us. When I talk about my uncle or my mom, I want you to see your uncle and your mom in the stories. That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very joyful. It kind of takes the stigma out of loss and sickness and lets people know that they\u2019re going to be OK no matter what happens.\u201d",
      "The title comes from the days when Ross was living with his grandfather in New Jersey. The younger man would take his grandfather to doctor visits or visit him in the hospital during the day and at night go into New York for open-mic nights.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather would always give me money for the bus and a banana, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Take a banana for the ride.\u2019 I reluctantly took it, and more often than not, I\u2019d be stuck in traffic, or I\u2019d get low blood sugar, and that banana would be a lifesaver,\u201d says Ross.",
      "\u201cBut it was really his way of saying, \u2018Be ready for anything\u2019 and also, \u2018I can\u2019t go with you but I\u2019m there with you in spirit.\u2019 So it was an emotional thing, it was a practical thing. It\u2019s something that I still do.\u201d",
      "Ross is known as \u201cThe Roastmaster General\u201d for his incendiary takedowns of Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady, among many others.",
      "The seeds for \u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d were planted in the mid-1990s when Ross gathered jokes and stories about his grandfather for an hourlong set. But digging up the past proved too much.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain it emotionally. It was just too much for me as a 30-year-old guy,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBut now, 30 years later, I can dig in and look back and add a layer of experience over it all.\u201d",
      "He was spurred on in large part to losing three comedic friends \u2014 Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried and Norm Macdonald \u2014 within eight months. \u201cThat motivated me to look back at the old show from decades earlier and rewrite it completely for my current brain and my current skill set.\u201d",
      "Ross will be the latest comedian to come to Broadway, following John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Alex Edelman, Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key, Rachel Dratch, Billy Crystal and Colin Quinn. Bill Burr made his Broadway debut this year in a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d",
      "Ross reaches back even further. His aunt took him to see Jackie Mason\u2019s \u201cThe World According to Me!\u201d in the 1980s, and the young comedian was floored by the comedian's captivating set.",
      "\u201cIt was elegant, but it was also punk rock because he was being bawdy and naughty and hilarious and saying taboo things and it really, really stayed with me for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cJaws\u201d turns 50 this week, and its legacy of the summer movie blockbuster remains strong.",
      "The titles that have packed the most summer moviegoers into theaters since 1975 represent some of the best known films of the last half century, including five \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies, Pixar favorites like \u201cToy Story 3\u201d and \u201cFinding Nemo,\u201d superheroes galore and both \u201cTop Gun\u201d films. They also include some surprises, and movies both less bombastic and less enduring.",
      "Combined, the top-earning summer films between 1975 and 2004 have more than $15 billion through the summer months, a figure not adjusted for inflation, according to the tracking firm Comscore.",
      "It's also worth noting that box-office tracking before 1981 was not as robust as it is today \u2014 and there was essentially no summer movie season in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic shuttered theaters across the country.",

      "Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark",
      "NEW YORK -- Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark.",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, his second feature, left such a imprint on culture and Hollywood that barely any trip to the movies, let alone to the beach, has been the same since.",
      "Few films have been more perfectly suited to their time and place than \u201cJaws,\u201d which half a century ago unspooled across the country in a then-novel wide release accompanied by Universal Pictures' opening-weekend publicity blitz. \u201cJaws\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the first movie to try to gobble up moviegoers whole, in one mouthful (a few years earlier, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d more or less tried it), but \u201cJaws\u201d established \u2014 and still in many ways defines \u2014 the summer movie.",
      "That puts \u201cJaws\u201d at the birth of a trend that has since consumed Hollywood: the blockbuster era. When it launched in 409 theaters on June 20, 1975, and grossed a then-record $7.9 million in its first days, \u201cJaws\u201d set the template that\u2019s been followed ever-after by every action movie, superhero flick or dinosaur film that\u2019s tried to go big in the summer \u2014 a sleepy time in theaters before \u201cJaws\u201d came around.",
      "And yet the \u201cJaws\u201d legacy is so much more than being Hollywood\u2019s ur-text blockbuster. It\u2019s not possible to, 50 years later, watch Spielberg\u2019s film and see nothing but the beginning of a box-office bonanza, or the paler fish it\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s just too good a movie \u2014 and too much unlike so many wannabes since \u2013\u2014 to be merely groundbreaking. It\u2019s a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "\u201cIt supercharged the language of cinema,\u201d the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis says in the upcoming documentary \u201cJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,\u201d premiering July 10 on National Geographic.",
      "That documentary, with Spielberg\u2019s participation, is just a small part of the festivities that have accompanied the movie's anniversary. Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201cJaws\u201d was shot, is hosting everything from concerts to \u201cJaws\u201d-themed dog dress-ups. \u201cJaws,\u201d itself, is streaming on Peacock through July 14, along with a prime-time airing Friday on NBC, with an intro from Spielberg. The \u201cJaws\u201d anniversary feels almost more like a national holiday \u2014 and appropriately so.",
      "But if \u201cJaws\u201d is one of the most influential movies ever made, Hollywood hasn't always drawn the right lessons from it. \u201cWe need a bigger boat\u201d has perhaps been taken too literally in movies that have leaned too much on scale and spectacle, when neither of those things really had much to do with the brilliance of Spielberg\u2019s classic.",
      "For the film\u2019s 50th anniversary, we looked at some of the things today's Hollywood could learn from \u201cJaws\" 50 years later.",
      "Every time I rewatch \u201cJaws\u201d \u2014 which I highly recommend doing on some projected screen, even a bedsheet, and preferably with an ocean nearby \u2014 I marvel at how much it gets from its Martha\u2019s Vineyard setting.",
      "Where U.S.-made film productions are shot has been a hot button issue lately. Various incentives often determine movie shooting locations, with set dressings, or CGI, filling in the rest. But \u201cJaws\u201d shows you just how much more than tax credits you can get from a locale.",
      "Spielberg was convinced the adaptation of Peter Benchley\u2019s novel \u2014 inspired by Benchley\u2019s childhood summers on Nantucket \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be done in soundstages. After looking up and down the Atlantic coast, he settled on Nantucket\u2019s neighboring island. Like his first film, the Mojave Desert-set \u201cDuel,\u201d Spielberg wanted his mechanized shark to swim in a real, definable place.",
      "\u201cI felt the same way about \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d Spielberg says in the documentary. \u201cI wanted to go to the natural environment so there was some kind of verisimilitude. So it needed to be in the ocean, out to sea.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. The budget for \u201cJaws\u201d nearly tripled to $9 million and the shoot extended from 55 to 159 days. Spielberg would never again be under financial pressure on a picture, but the tortured \u201cJaws\u201d production put him under a microscope. An AP report from 1975 began: \u201cIt is news when a 26-year-old film director goes $2 million over budget and two and a half months over schedule and manages to avoid getting fired.\u201d",
      "More than any other time in his career, Spielberg fretted.",
      "\u201c\u2018Jaws\u2019 was my Vietnam,\u201d he told Richard Schickel. \u201cIt was basically naive people against nature and nature beat us every day.\u201d",
      "It also infused every inch of the frame with smalltown New England flavor in the way that no soundstage, or CGI, ever could.",
      "When Spielberg was ready to start filming, his star attraction wasn\u2019t. The mechanized shark, nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d after the director\u2019s attorney, suffered frequent failures that forced Spielberg to find different approaches to shooting his shark scenes early in the film.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d instead became, to Spielberg, a kind of homage to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho.\u201d The suspense came less from the shark than the fear of the unknown and that spine-tingling question: What\u2019s in the water? Spielberg, with the significant aid of John Williams\u2019 instantly iconic score, delayed the appearance of his Great White until well into the film.",
      "\u201cThe visual ellipsis,\u201d the critic Molly Haskell wrote, \u201ccreated far greater menace and terror, as the shark is nowhere and everywhere.\u201d",
      "Spielberg once estimated that Bruce\u2019s mechanical delays added $175 million to the movie\u2019s box office. On its initial run, \u201cJaws\u201d grossed $260.7 million domestically in 1975. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion. Nowadays, the shark would almost certainly be done, like most movie creatures, with computer animation. But \u201cJaws\u201d showed that often the most powerful source of dread is our imagination.",
      "This is the time of year when the fate of the world often hangs in the balance. All manner of summer movies have had no bones about destroying cities for a mere plot point. Yet for all its terror, \u201cJaws\" features only a handful of deaths. All of its drama is human-scaled. Compared to more swaggering blockbusters today, \u201cJaws\u201d would be considered a modest, mid-budget movie.",
      "That\u2019s partially why you have to almost remind yourself that the movie has only three main characters in Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw). Casting director Sherry Rhodes peopled the cast with locals from the island, many of whom inject the film with little moments of day-to-day humanity. \u201cJaws,\u201d in that way, feels more like a community than a cast.",
      "On the one hand, \u201cJaws\u201d had little to do directly with its times. The Vietnam War had just ended. Watergate had just led to the resignation of President Nixon. The heart-stopping story of a shark off the Massachusetts shoreline promised escapism.",
      "Yet \u201cJaws\u201d has endured as a parable of capitalism, pulled out time and time again to illustrate those endlessly repeating clashes of cash versus social safety.",
      "\u201cAmity is a summer town,\u201d says Amity\u2019s mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) in the film. \u201cWe need summer dollars.\u201d",
      "The shark gets the theme song and the movie poster, but the real villain of \u201cJaws\u201d wears a pinstripe suit and smiles for the cameras. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day and the beaches are open,\u201d he says. More than the predator in the ocean, he, and the town, feast on human flesh.",
      "There are boatloads of movies \u2014 including the three sequels that followed after \u2014 that have tried in vain to capture some of the magic of \u201cJaws.\u201d But what happened in June 1975, let alone on Martha\u2019s Vineyard the year before, isn\u2019t repeatable. Even the greatest movies are products of a thousand small miracles. That title? Benchley came up with it minutes before going to print. The iconic poster came from Roger Kastel's painting for the book. Scheider, for instance, learned about the movie by overhearing Spielberg at a party. Williams relied on just two notes for one of the most widely known film scores in movie history.",
      "But no ingredient mattered more on \u201cJaws\u201d than the man behind the camera. Filmmaking talents like Spielberg come around maybe a couple times a century, and in \u201cJaws,\u201d he emerged, spectacularly. What's maybe most striking about \u201cJaws\u201d 50 years later is how much it still doesn't look like anything else.",
      "___",
      "Jake Coyle has been writing about movies for the AP since 2013. He's seen \u201cJaws\u201d at least a dozen times, and screened it for his kids when they were debatably too young for it.",

      "An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America in a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit heat that hasn\u2019t been seen in some places in more than a decade",
      "NEW YORK -- An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America under a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit temperatures in places that haven't been so hot in more than a decade.",
      "The heat wave is especially threatening because it's hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia early in the summer when people haven't gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions, several meteorologists said. The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.",
      "A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a \u201cnear historic\u201d heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cLike an air fryer, it\u2019s going to be hot,\" Maue said. \u201dThis is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.\u201d",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the country's population \u2014 245 million people \u2014 will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.",
      "Those triple-digit air temperatures \u2014 with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity \u2014 are possible in places where it\u2019s unusual. New York hasn\u2019t seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn\u2019t reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.",
      "In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.",
      "The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have kids getting heat stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hot today.\u201c",
      "NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.",
      "The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.",
      "A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.",
      "Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.",
      "\"The \u2018big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,\" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. \u201cThe area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 \u2014 a level Woods Placky said feels like \u201cyou\u2019re in a swimming pool\u201d and \u201cthe atmosphere is absorbing you.\u201d",
      "If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.",
      "\u201cIt will be a shock to the system,\u201d she said.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz called prior the practice \u201ca pox on the system\u201d that hikes administrative costs during his Senate confirmation hearing in March to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Insurers said Monday that they will standardize electronic prior authorization by the end of next year to help speed up the process. They will reduce the scope of claims subject to it.",
      "They also plan to expand the number of real-time responses and ensure medical reviews are done for denied requests.",
      "Researchers say prior authorization has grown more common as care costs have climbed, especially for prescription drugs, lab testing, physical therapy and imaging exams.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",

      "A new report finds that the number of abortions in the U.S. grew in 2024 as more women obtained pills through telehealth",
      "The number of abortions in the U.S. rose again in 2024, with women continuing to find ways to get them despite bans and restrictions in many states, according to a report out Monday.",
      "The latest report from the WeCount project of the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access, was released a day before the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended nearly 50 years of legal abortion nationally for most of pregnancy.",
      "Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they are pregnant.",
      "While the total number of abortions has risen gradually over those three years, the number has dropped to near zero in some states, while abortions using pills obtained through telehealth appointments have become more common in nearly all states.",
      "Pills are used in the majority of abortions and are also prescribed in person.",
      "The latest survey, released Monday, tallied about 1.1 million abortions nationally last year, or about 95,000 a month. That is up from about 88,000 monthly in 2023 and 80,000 a month between April and December of 2022. WeCount began after Roe was overturned, and the 2022 numbers don't include January through March, when abortions are traditionally at their highest.",
      "The number is still well below the historic peak in the U.S. of nearly 1.6 million a year in the late 1990s.",
      "The Society of Family Planning relies primarily on surveys of abortion providers and uses estimates.",
      "WeCount found that in the months before the Dobbs ruling was handed down, about 1 in 20 abortions was accessed by telehealth.",
      "But during the last three months of 2024, it was up to 1 in 4.",
      "The biggest jump over that time came in the middle of 2023, when laws in some Democratic-controlled states took effect with provisions intended to protect medical professionals who use telehealth to prescribe pills to patients in states where abortion is banned or where there are laws restricting telehealth abortion.",
      "WeCount found that about half of the telehealth abortions last year were facilitated by the shield laws. The number of telehealth abortions also grew for those in states without bans.",
      "WeCount is the only nationwide public source of information about the pills prescribed to women in states with bans. One key caveat is that it is not clear how many of the prescriptions result in abortion. Some women may change their minds, access in-person abortion or be seeking pills to save for future use.",
      "The WeCount data could help explain data from a separate survey from the Guttmacher Institute, which found the number of people crossing state lines for abortion declined last year.",
      "Anti-abortion efforts are zeroing in on pills, along with barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood and undoing ballot measures that provided for abortion access.",
      "Three states have sued to try to get courts to limit telehealth prescriptions of mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. President Donald Trump's administration last month told a judge it does not believe the states have legal standing to make that case.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that anti-abortion doctors and their organizations didn't have standing, either.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana are using criminal laws, and there is an effort in Texas to use civil penalties against a New York doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to women in their states. Louisiana lawmakers have also sent the governor a bill to further restrict access to the pills.",
      "SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said on a call with reporters Monday that it's a priority for her group to keep pushing U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials to investigate the safety of abortion pills \u2014 and to require that they be dispensed only in person.",

      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has vetoed a bill to ban all THC products",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed a bill Sunday to ban all THC consumables, allowing the booming market flush with THC-infused vapes, gummies and other products to continue to be sold across the state.",
      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief. Many retailers across the state also pointed to the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue the industry brings each year.",
      "Last year, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed a bill that would have put age restrictions on THC consumables, claiming it would hurt small businesses.",

    "story": [
      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "Bicycles have long been ubiquitous, and many families tend to have one. Cultural norms in northern Uganda don\u2019t prohibit women from riding. While the roads in Lira town are paved, dirt paths lead into the heart of the district where farming is the main economic activity.",
      "The Buffalo Bicycle is a recent arrival. Many have never heard of it, or can't afford it. Retailing for roughly $200, it is three times more expensive than the cheapest regular bicycle \u2014 otherwise out of reach for many CHEWs, who do not yet earn a salary.",

      "A Brazilian woman who says she became pregnant after being raped in March should have been granted access to a legal abortion",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A 27-year-old Brazilian woman, who said she became pregnant after being raped in March during Carnival in Brasilia, should have been granted access to a legal abortion. But when she sought to terminate the pregnancy at a hospital around a month later, she was told she needed a police report to access the service, despite it not being a legal requirement.",
      "She decided to abort at home with medication she bought on the black market, with only a few friends on site to help.",
      "\u201cI fainted several times because of the pain. I was terrified I was going to die,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "In Brazil, abortion is legally restricted to cases of rape, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Theoretically, when a pregnancy results from sexual violence, the victim\u2019s word should suffice for access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t require judicial authorization or anything like that,\u201d explained Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cA woman seeking an abortion recounts the situation to a multi-disciplinary team at the healthcare clinic and, in theory, that should be enough.\u201d",
      "In practice, however, advocates, activists and health experts say women encounter significant barriers to ending a pregnancy even under the limited conditions provided for by the law. This is due to factors including lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols and even resistance from medical personnel.",
      "\u201cHealthcare professionals, citing religious or moral convictions, often refuse to provide legal abortions, even when working in clinics authorized to perform them,\u201d said Carla de Castro Gomes, a sociologist who studies abortion and associate researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Women in Brazil also face geographical barriers to legal abortions. Only 290 facilities in a mere 3.6% of municipalities around the country of approximately 213 million people provide the service, according to a 2021 study from scientific journal Reports in Public Health.",
      "In June 2022, four nonprofits filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that restrictions on abortion access violate women\u2019s constitutional rights. The case is currently under review.",
      "A 35-year-old cashier from a small city in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state also said she became pregnant as a result of a rape. But, unlike the woman in Brasilia, she chose to pursue an abortion through legal means, fearing the risks that come with a clandestine procedure.",
      "Although Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry mandates that, in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape, healthcare professionals must present women with their rights and support them in their decision, the woman said a hospital committee refused to terminate the pregnancy. They claimed she was too far along, despite Brazilian law not stipulating a time limit for such procedures.",
      "She eventually found help through the Sao Paulo-based Women Alive Project, a nonprofit specializing in helping victims of sexual violence access legal abortions. The organization helped her locate a hospital in another state, an 18-hour drive, willing to carry out the procedure.",
      "Thanks to a fundraising campaign, the woman was able to travel and undergo the operation at 30 weeks of pregnancy in late April.",
      "\u201cWe are already victims of violence and are forced to suffer even more,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a right guaranteed by law, but unfortunately still seen as taboo.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are among the most constrictive in Latin America, where several countries \u2014 including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have enacted sweeping reforms to legalize or broadly decriminalize abortion.",
      "This legislative environment is exacerbated by a political landscape in which far-right politicians, supported by Catholic and Evangelical voters who make up a majority in the country, regularly seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.",
      "In 2020, the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro issued an ordinance requiring doctors to report rape victims seeking abortions to the police. Current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva revoked the measure in his first month in office in 2023.",
      "But the measure left lasting effects.",
      "\u201cThese changes end up generating a lot of legal uncertainty among health professionals, who fear prosecution for performing legal abortions,\u201d Castro Gomes said.",
      "Last year, conservative lawmaker S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante proposed a bill to equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide, sparking widespread protests by feminist groups across Brazil. The protests ultimately led to the proposal being shelved.",
      "But in November, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would effectively outlaw all abortions by determining the \u201cinviolability of the right to life from conception.\u201d The bill is currently on hold, awaiting the formation of a commission.",
      "Earlier this month, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, came under fire after sanctioning a bill mandating anti-abortion messages on posters in municipal hospitals and other health establishments.",
      "Advocates say access to abortion highlights significant disparities: women with financial means dodge legal restrictions by traveling abroad for the procedure, while children, poor women and Black women face greater obstacles.",
      "According to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, 61.6% of the 83,988 rape victims in 2023 were under the age of 14. A statistical analysis that year by investigative outlet The Intercept estimated less than 4% of girls aged 10 to 14 who became pregnant as a result of rape accessed a legal abortion between 2015 and 2020.",
      "In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela, one of the city\u2019s largest low-income communities, the nonprofit Networks of Mare\u2019s House of Women provides women with information regarding their reproductive rights, including legal provisions for abortions.",
      "It was there, during a recent workshop, that Karina Braga de Souza, a 41-year-old mother of five, found out abortion is legal in certain cases in Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have access (to information). Doctors don\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said.",
      "Feminist groups in Brazil are campaigning at a federal level for enhanced access to legal abortion services.",
      "Last year, \u201cA Child Is Not a Mother,\u201d a campaign by feminist groups, successfully advocated for the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents to adopt a resolution detailing how to handle cases of pregnant child rape victims. The body, jointly made up of government ministries and civil society organizations, approved the resolution by a slim majority in December.",
      "Brazilian activists also are seeking to improve access to abortion by forging links with organizations abroad.",
      "In May, members of feminist groups in Brazil including Neither in Prison, Nor Dead and Criola met with a delegation of mostly Black U.S. state legislators. The meeting, organized by the Washington, D.C.-based Women\u2019s Equality Center, aimed to foster collaboration on strategies to defend reproductive rights, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court 2022 decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "In the meantime, the consequences for women who struggle to access their rights run deep.",
      "The woman in Brasilia who underwent an abortion at home said she is coping thanks to therapy and the support of other women, but has been traumatized by recent events.",
      "By being denied access to a legal abortion, \u201cour bodies feel much more pain than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I remember, I feel very angry.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers meet next week, but their agenda suggests they'll skip some expected topics \u2014 including a vote on COVID-19 shots \u2014 while taking up a longtime target of anti-vaccine groups.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations on how to use the nation's vaccines, setting a schedule for children's vaccines as well as advice for adult shots. Last week, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "The agenda for the new committee's first meeting, posted Wednesday, shows it will be shorter than expected. Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session, but the agenda lists no vote on that. Instead, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations, on RSV vaccinations for pregnant women and children and on the use of a preservative named thimerosal that's in a subset of flu shots.",
      "It's not clear who wrote the agenda. No committee chairperson has been named and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not comment.",
      "Missing from the agenda are some heavily researched vaccine policy proposals the advisers were supposed to consider this month, including shots against HPV and meningococcal bacteria, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Instead, the committee is talking about subjects \u201cwhich are settled science,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be asking themselves how and why did we get here, where leaders are promoting their own agenda instead of protecting our people and our communities,\u201d she said. She worried it's \"part of a purposeful agenda to insert dangerous and harmful and unnecessary fear regarding vaccines into the process.\u201d",
      "The committee makes recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC has no director and the committee's recommendations have been going to Kennedy.",
      "Thimerosal was added to certain vaccines in the early 20th century to make them safer and more accessible by preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials. It's a tiny amount, but because it's a form of mercury, it began raising questions in the 1990s.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in an antivaccine movement before he became President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary \u2014 has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger.",
      "Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.",
      "Thimerosal now only appears in multidose flu shot vials, not the single-shot packaging of most of today's flu shots.",
      "Targeting thimerosal would likely force manufacturers to switch to single-dose vials, which would make the shots \u201cmore expensive, less available and more feared,\u201d said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Last week, 30 organizations called on insurers to continue paying for COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women after Kennedy said the shots would no longer be routinely recommended for that group.",
      "Doctors' groups also opposed Kennedy's changes to the vaccine committee. The new members he picked include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a top critic of pandemic-era lockdowns and a leader of a group that has been widely considered to be a source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has long put out its own immunization recommendations. In recent decades it has matched what the government recommended. But asked if they might soon diverge, depending on potential changes in the government's vaccination recommendations, Kressly said; \u201cNothing's off the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to make sure that every child in every community gets the vaccines that they deserve to stay healthy and safe,\u201d she said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, maker Gilead Sciences announced Wednesday. It's the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions \u2013 although it's unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.",
      "While a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot \u2014 a drug called lenacapvir \u2014 could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.",
      "\u201cThis really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission,\u201d said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but what's called PrEP \u2014 regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months \u2014 is increasingly important. Lenacapavir's six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.",
      "But upheaval in U.S. healthcare \u2014 including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid \u2014 and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.",
      "Millett said \"gaping holes in the system\" in the U.S. and globally \"are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into people\u2019s bodies but make sure they come back\u201d even as little as twice a year.",
      "Gilead\u2019s drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. It\u2019s given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small \u201cdepot\u201d of medication to slowly absorb into the body.",
      "Gilead didn't immediately announce its price. The drug only prevents HIV transmission \u2013 it doesn\u2019t block other sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.",
      "Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.",
      "About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partner's knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.",
      "A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.",
      "Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.",
      "\u201cNow I forget that I\u2019m on PrEP because I don\u2019t have to carry around a pill bottle,\u201d said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "\u201cMen, women, gay, straight \u2013 it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention,\u201d he added. Just remembering a clinic visit every six months \u201cis a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure you\u2019re taking your pill every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone in every country who\u2019s at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP,\u201d added Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. \u201cWe need to get easier access to PrEP that\u2019s highly effective like this is.\u201d",

      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, and white people account for the vast majority of the deaths",
      "NEW YORK -- Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, according to a new federal report published Wednesday, with white people accounting for the vast majority of the deaths.",
      "From 2003 to 2023, death rates from falls rose more than 70% for adults ages 65 to 74, the report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The rate increased more than 75% for people 75 to 84, and more than doubled for seniors 85 and older.",
      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "In 2020, the insurgents carried out a wave attacks in which they beheaded dozens of people, including children. Witnesses have said that children abducted from towns and villages have been used as fighters in subsequent attacks.",
      "The violence has displaced more than 600,000 people and spilled into neighboring provinces, according to the United Nations.",
      "Human Rights Watch said there had been a resurgence of attacks and child kidnappings in the last two months and called on Mozambique's government to do more to find the children and prevent further abductions.",
      "The problems in Cabo Delgado were largely overshadowed by Mozambique's deadly and long-running post-election protests last year. Cabo Delgado has also been battered by several recent cyclones and hurt by U.S. President Donald Trump's cuts to foreign aid.",
      "The Norwegian Refugee Council's Secretary General, Jan Egeland, visited Cabo Delgado this month and described the situation in northern Mozambique as a neglected crisis.",

      "Pope Leo XIV is kicking off a weeklong celebration of Catholic clergy for the Holy Year",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV kicked off a weeklong celebration of Catholic clergy Tuesday by encouraging seminarians to be joyful and honest, offering an uplifting message after Pope Francis frequently castigated priests and decried what he called the sin of \"clericalism.\u201d",
      "History's first American pope presided over a rollicking encounter with thousands of young men who were in Rome for a special Jubilee week celebrating seminarians, priests and bishops.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s encounter turned St. Peter\u2019s Basilica into something resembling a concert venue, with seminarians waving their national flags, interrupting Leo frequently with applause and shouts of \u201cPapa Leone\u201d and straining against barricades to kiss his ring as he passed.",
      "In his remarks, Leo thanked the seminarians for agreeing to devote their lives to the church and said that with their energy \u201cyou fuel the flame of hope in the life of the church.\u201d He urged them to be brave, joyful, truthful and not hide behind masks or live hypocritical lives.",
      "\"You also have to learn to give a name and voice to sadness, fear, anxiety and indignation, bringing everything before God,\u201d the Augustinian pope told them. \u201cCrises, limitations, fragilities aren\u2019t to be hidden, but are rather occasions for grace.\u201d",
      "Francis also frequently met with seminarians, priests and bishops. But he often had a message of tough love, railing against what he called clericalism, or the tendency to put priests and clergy on a pedestal. For Francis, clericalism was the root of many of the church\u2019s problems, especially the clergy sex abuse and cover-up scandal, given how he said it can contribute to abuses of power and authority.",
      "While offering a more positive message, Leo cited many of Francis\u2019 concerns in urging seminarians to accompany the poor and lamenting today's \u201cthrowaway culture.\u201d The seminarians interrupted him with applause when he cited Francis by name.",
      "The message of encouragement may also have been aimed at addressing the Catholic Church\u2019s chronic hemorrhaging of the number of clergy.",
      "According to the latest Vatican statistics, the number of seminarians worldwide continued to drop even as the Catholic population grew. There were 108,481 seminarians at the end of 2022, compared to 109,895 the previous year. Only Africa and Oceania registered increases and the church registered steep declines in the traditionally Catholic Americas and Europe, and a more modest decline in Asia.",
      "Over the coming days, Leo is expected to hold similar encounters with priests and bishops before presiding over a Jubilee Mass this weekend. This week marks something of the halfway mark of the Vatican\u2019s 2025 Holy Year, a celebration of Catholicism held once every quarter-century that has brought millions of pilgrims to Rome.",

      "Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt even before it took office last month. It acted ahead of the NATO summit starting Tuesday that aims to raise allies' defense spending target from 2% of GDP to 3.5%, plus another 1.5% for potentially defense-related infrastructure.",
      "Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said Germany's defense spending will hit 2.4% of GDP this year, and \u201cwe will raise defense spending step by step so that we will reach a NATO quota of 3.5% in 2029.\u201d",
      "Klingbeil, who is also the vice chancellor, said he will \u201cbe very vigilant that the money is spent efficiently,\u201d for example by aiming for greater cooperation at European level on procurement, research and development.",
      "Germany for years drew criticism for failing to hit the existing 2% spending target. But, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged to increase defense spending to 2%. He also announced the creation of a 100 billion-euro ($115-billion) special modernization fund.",
      "Germany met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027.",

      "Johannes Hahn, the EU envoy for Cyprus, held his first meeting Tuesday with Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides in his new capacity, which officials hope will build momentum toward reviving stalled negotiations led by the United Nations.",
      "Cyprus was cleaved along ethnic lines in 1974 when Turkey invaded in the wake of a coup that aimed to unify the island with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a 1983 Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island\u2019s northern third where Turkey maintains more than 35,000 troops.",
      "Hahn said after the discussion with Christodoulides Tuesday that he would reach out to all stakeholders, including Turkey, to help build confidence and support for Maria Angela Holguin, who is heading up peace efforts as the envoy to Cyprus representing U.N.

      "Although Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, only the southern Greek Cypriot part where the internationally recognized government is seated enjoys full membership benefits.",
      "Turkey began EU membership talks in 2005, but those have stalled over its refusal to recognize the Cypriot government as the island\u2019s sole legal authority. Turkey remains keen to conclude visa liberalization talks with the EU that began in 2013.",
      "Cyprus backs closer EU-Turkey ties as long as there is clear progress on Cyprus peace talks, government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said.",
      "The primary obstacle to restarting peace talks is Turkish and Turkish Cypriot insistence on a deal that would recognize two states on the island. This goes against a peace blueprint endorsed by the the U.N. Security Council that foresees a federated Cyprus with Greek-speaking and Turkish-speaking zones.",
      "Greek Cypriots reject any agreement that would formalize partition, fearing Turkey would seek to control the entire island in light of its demand to maintain a permanent troop presence and military intervention rights in Cyprus.

      "HONG KONG -- The U.S. consulate in Hong Kong on Tuesday condemned the city's government for what it called repression of U.S. Independence Day celebrations after local education authorities reportedly cautioned teachers and students not to attend such events organized by American diplomats.",
      "The consulate accused the Hong Kong government of interfering with U.S. Consulate General-hosted events, saying U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide celebrate Independence Day every year by hosting receptions and other festivities.",
      "\"We condemn the Hong Kong government\u2019s repression of U.S. Independence Day celebrations,\" it said in an emailed reply to The Associated Press\u2019 questions. \u201cIts attempts to characterize these activities as \u2018unlawful\u2019 only further reveals its insecurity and fear of freedom.\"",
      "The consulate's criticism came days after a Facebook page, \u201cEdu Lancet,\" reported that the city's education authorities had sent \u201cfriendly reminders\" to multiple schools asking their teachers not to \u201ccasually join\u201d the consulate's events and be cautious about violating the national security law. The reminder also asked the schools to discourage their students from joining such events, it said.",
      "The Associated Press could not independently verify the claims by the Facebook page, which often provides updates about the education sector. A local English-language newspaper, the South China Morning Post, also reported that the authorities had reminded schools to be vigilant about any attempts to promote U.S. Independence Day celebrations on campus.",
      "The city's education bureau has not immediately commented.",
      "Hong Kong Secretary for Security Chris Tang previously accused the founder of the page, Hans Yeung, of seizing opportunities to incite division in society in a media interview published in March.",
      "Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong in 2020 following massive anti-government protests in 2019, saying the legislation was necessary to return stability to the city.",
      "Under the law, dozens of leading activists were prosecuted or jailed while others fled. Fears about the law drove many middle-class families and young professionals to emigrate elsewhere.",

In 2018, a massive fire swept through the seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, trapping people in their homes and on roads as they tried to flee.

Still, Spain has said it cannot, and that the target is \"unreasonable.\" President Donald Trump has said the U.S. should not have to.",

      "Independent car mechanics in South Africa\u2019s townships have long worked outside of the country\u2019s vehicle repair industry",
      "BRAKPAN, South Africa -- Themba Maseko quickly wipes oil and grease off his hands with a rag as he breaks away from repairing one car to assist another customer who needs parts for a low-riding BMW 325is that he\u2019s pulled up in, exhausts booming.",
      "As soon as Maseko returns beneath the hood of the first vehicle to continue his work, yet another man arrives desperately wanting his car to be looked at.",
      "\u201cIt gets hectic,\u201d said the 39-year-old mechanic, sweat plastering his face.",
      "The father of three runs a small motor repair shop in the township of Tsakane, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of South Africa\u2019s biggest city of Johannesburg. His hopes for his business to succeed when it\u2019s up against established urban car service and repair centers have been boosted by a new initiative started at the end of last year.",
      "Maseko has joined with other mechanics from townships to form a cooperative. Together, they now have combined purchasing power to ensure they can source official car spares and equipment for their shops and don\u2019t get cut out of the market. The Motor Spares Collective means they can place orders to an online spares shop through WhatsApp and authentic parts are usually delivered to them in 24 hours.",
      "That avoids what Maseko says is his biggest challenge: spending hours away from his garage queuing for parts, sometimes to find there aren\u2019t any in stock because they\u2019ve been bought up by larger chains.",
      "As one busy day at his shop showed, the customers are lining up for Maseko\u2019s services, he just needs the parts.",
      "\u201cNow with the collective it\u2019s much easier. I don\u2019t have to go stand in queue and waste time,\u201d said Maseko, who changed career from an electrician to a full-time mechanic in 2008. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s at a cheaper price.\u201d",
      "The Motor Spares Collective is one initiative designed to unlock the potential of small township businesses in South Africa, which the government has identified as key to driving growth and creating jobs in areas where unemployment and poverty are high.",
      "Various studies indicate that more than 21 million people in South Africa live in townships on the edge of major cities or towns \u2014 a third of the population \u2014 and they have a combined spending power of billions of dollars and generally prefer local businesses.",
      "South Africa has over 700,000 registered small businesses. In the townships these include hair salons, taverns, car repair shops, laundromats and others sometimes operating out of people\u2019s homes. According to a report by financial services group Lesaka, South Africa\u2019s informal sector generates an estimated $33 billion in revenue, or more than 6% of GDP.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t respect the trade in the townships,\u201d said Sharief Bartus, another member of the motor spares collective.",
      "For a $10 monthly membership fee for the first year, Maseko and the others get more than just access to car parts and tools for their garages. The collective also offers skills development opportunities, help with business registration and financing.",
      "\u201cThe more members we get, the more discounts we get, the more work we have,\u201d said Dorian Slimmerts, another mechanic in the collective who is operating not far from Maseko.",
      "Township mechanics offering a local option for car owners have long battled on the fringes of the country\u2019s commercial auto manufacturing and repair sector. A regulation change in 2020 also made a big difference. New \u201cright to repair\u201d rules in South Africa mean car owners can now have their vehicles serviced by registered independent mechanics and not lose their warranties.",
      "That\u2019s opened the door a little more for township mechanics.",
      "Car maintenance is especially needed in South Africa, where there are around 12 million automobiles on the road and people are keeping their cars longer. The demand for affordable pre-owned cars has outpaced new cars since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Time is the critical element for township mechanics, though. Their businesses see lots of walk-in clients, prices are often negotiated and customers expect quick service \u2014 or they will look elsewhere.",
      "\u201cAll the mechanic sells is time,\u201d said Amanda Gcabashe, managing director of UBU Investment Holdings, an economic advisory company that helped set up the cooperative. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we came with this to say, how do we make sure that we then solve that pain point by making spares easily accessible?\u201d",
      "She said that as well as the business help, the collective is also looking to offer life insurance packages and other social safety net services for its mechanics.",
      "Bulelani Balabala, the founder of the Township Entrepreneurs Alliance, said cooperatives were a powerful way to harness the potential of small businesses serving millions of people in townships.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 The World Bank granted South Africa a $1.5 billion loan to upgrade transportation infrastructure and help it transition toward a low-carbon economy, the country's National Treasury said Monday.",
      "Deteriorating rail systems, jammed ports and frequent blackouts have hindered vital industries like mining and auto manufacturing in South Africa, contributing to slow economic growth over the last decade in Africa's most developed economy.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and his coalition government have pledged to tackle corruption and decades of poor management as well as pursue reforms to get the country out of its economic rut and ease its extremely high unemployment rate.",
      "While it did not give specifics, the South African government said it expects the World Bank loan will enable inclusive economic growth and job creation by assisting in the removal of important infrastructure bottlenecks, especially in the energy and freight transportation sectors.",
      "\u201cThis agreement reinforces the strong and constructive collaboration between the World Bank and the government of South Africa,\u201d said the National Treasury. \u201cThis partnership marks a significant step toward addressing South Africa\u2019s pressing economic challenges of low growth and high unemployment.\"",
      "Additionally, because the financing has better conditions than conventional borrowing, such as a three-year grace period, it should reduce escalating debt-service expenses, it added.",
      "South Africa\u2019s 2025-26 budget has allocated over R1 trillion over the next three years toward critical transportation, energy, water and sanitation infrastructure while improving access to basic services.",
      "However, real gross domestic product was revised downward to 1.4% in 2025 from 1.9% previously projected by the Finance Ministry projected in March because of the worsening global outlook and the persistence of logistics constraints and higher borrowing costs.",
      "Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said government debt is projected to stabilize at 77.4% of GDP in 2025/26.",
      "Earlier this year, the dismantling of USAID by the Trump administration cut around $436 million in annual funding to South Africa for HIV treatment and prevention, putting the program and thousands of health care jobs on the line.",
      "Godongwana said the country doesn\u2019t have the funds to cover the more than $430 million shortfall caused by the Trump administration\u2019s cuts in foreign aid, which have threatened the vast network of support for one of the world\u2019s largest HIV-positive populations.",

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian lawmakers voted Monday decisively in favor of a new pro-European coalition government led by a center-right prime minister, as the European Union and NATO member nation seeks to end one of its worst political crises in its post-communist history.",
      "Parliament approved the new administration in a 301-9 vote in Romania\u2019s 464-seat legislature, days after Romania's new President Nicusor Dan nominated Ilie Bolojan of the center-right National Liberal Party, or PNL, to lead a new government. Some lawmakers from nationalist opposition parties were absent from the voting.",
      "The coalition is made up of the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, the PNL, the reformist Save Romania Union party, and the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party, with the support of national minorities. The ministerial positions will be shared among the parties, which will hold a comfortable majority. The prime ministerial position will be rotated in 2027 from Bolojan to a PSD premier as part of a power-sharing agreement.",
      "Ahead of the confidence vote on Monday, Bolojan, 56, called it a \u201cdecisive moment\" for Romania's future and said among his top priorities would be reducing the large budget deficit and reforming state institutions.",
      "\u201cDespite the challenges we face \u2026 Romania deserves a realistic and fair country project,\u201d he said. \u201cRomania must be stronger and more secure, with an economy that can and must grow \u2026 with reformed institutions and respect for citizens.\u201d",
      "With one of the highest budget deficits in the 27-nation EU bloc, the new government will face the challenge of introducing fiscal measures that Bolojan acknowledged could prove unpopular, especially ahead of a 2028 general election amid a growing shift toward populist parties.",
      "After parliament\u2019s approval, the Romanian president held a ceremony to swear in the new government at Cotroceni Palace in the capital, Bucharest.",
      "\u201cToday we begin a new chapter,\u201d President Dan said. \u201cWe must rebuild citizens\u2019 trust in the authorities of the Romanian state. It will be a long road, but I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll succeed.\u201d",
      "Bolojan previously served as acting president earlier this year, until Dan decisively beat a hard-right opponent in a heated presidential election rerun. That vote was held months after the previous election was annulled by a top court, which plunged Romania into a deep political crisis and exposed deep societal divisions in the country.",
      "The previous coalition, sworn in last December, collapsed following Marcel Ciolacu\u2019s resignation in May, after the joint candidate failed to make the presidential runoff.",
      "The current broad coalition is viewed as a tactical partnership to shut out right-wing nationalists, whose voices found fertile ground during Romania\u2019s chaotic election cycle, with growing anti-establishment sentiment.",
      "Sorin Grindeanu, the PSD leader, said his party \u201cwill be a responsible and honest partner\u201d in the new coalition, which he said is for \u201cthe good of this country and for the good of Romanians.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wish (the coalition) to be strong for the next three and a half years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are thus leaving the era of unprofitable interims and entering a period of rational and realistic solutions.\u201d",
      "George Simion, the leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, who lost the presidency to Dan in the runoff, said he didn\u2019t think the coalition would make it through the year.",

      "But the Ukrainian leader hasn't yet publicly confirmed he'll attend a dinner laid on for leaders attending the NATO summit, where his country has had a diplomatic downgrade from previous alliance meetings, even as leaders stress that their militaries need to muscle up to counter the threat of Russia.",
      "It's a big change since the summit in Washington last year, when the military alliance\u2019s weighty communique included a vow to supply long-term security assistance to Ukraine, and a commitment to back the country \u201con its irreversible path\u201d to NATO membership.",
      "But with Zelenskyy\u2019s relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump still strained since a testy Oval Office meeting earlier this year, finding a place for the Ukrainian leader at NATO\u2019s top table has proved a bridge too far.",
      "There are other meetings scheduled for Zelenskyy at the summit, but the doors remain shut to the leaders' working meeting Wednesday, even as Rutte acknowledged how heavily the war weighs on the leaders.",
      "\u201cOf course, the most significant and direct threat facing this alliance remains the Russian Federation,\" he said. \"Moscow continues to wage war against Ukraine with the support of North Korea, Iran and China, as well as Belarus.\u201d",

      "Independent car mechanics in South Africa\u2019s townships have long worked outside of the country\u2019s vehicle repair industry",
      "BRAKPAN, South Africa -- Themba Maseko quickly wipes oil and grease off his hands with a rag as he breaks away from repairing one car to assist another customer who needs parts for a low-riding BMW 325is that he\u2019s pulled up in, exhausts booming.",
      "As soon as Maseko returns beneath the hood of the first vehicle to continue his work, yet another man arrives desperately wanting his car to be looked at.",
      "\u201cIt gets hectic,\u201d said the 39-year-old mechanic, sweat plastering his face.",
      "The father of three runs a small motor repair shop in the township of Tsakane, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of South Africa\u2019s biggest city of Johannesburg. His hopes for his business to succeed when it\u2019s up against established urban car service and repair centers have been boosted by a new initiative started at the end of last year.",
      "Maseko has joined with other mechanics from townships to form a cooperative. Together, they now have combined purchasing power to ensure they can source official car spares and equipment for their shops and don\u2019t get cut out of the market. The Motor Spares Collective means they can place orders to an online spares shop through WhatsApp and authentic parts are usually delivered to them in 24 hours.",
      "That avoids what Maseko says is his biggest challenge: spending hours away from his garage queuing for parts, sometimes to find there aren\u2019t any in stock because they\u2019ve been bought up by larger chains.",
      "As one busy day at his shop showed, the customers are lining up for Maseko\u2019s services, he just needs the parts.",
      "\u201cNow with the collective it\u2019s much easier. I don\u2019t have to go stand in queue and waste time,\u201d said Maseko, who changed career from an electrician to a full-time mechanic in 2008. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s at a cheaper price.\u201d",
      "The Motor Spares Collective is one initiative designed to unlock the potential of small township businesses in South Africa, which the government has identified as key to driving growth and creating jobs in areas where unemployment and poverty are high.",
      "Various studies indicate that more than 21 million people in South Africa live in townships on the edge of major cities or towns \u2014 a third of the population \u2014 and they have a combined spending power of billions of dollars and generally prefer local businesses.",
      "South Africa has over 700,000 registered small businesses. In the townships these include hair salons, taverns, car repair shops, laundromats and others sometimes operating out of people\u2019s homes. According to a report by financial services group Lesaka, South Africa\u2019s informal sector generates an estimated $33 billion in revenue, or more than 6% of GDP.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t respect the trade in the townships,\u201d said Sharief Bartus, another member of the motor spares collective.",
      "For a $10 monthly membership fee for the first year, Maseko and the others get more than just access to car parts and tools for their garages. The collective also offers skills development opportunities, help with business registration and financing.",
      "\u201cThe more members we get, the more discounts we get, the more work we have,\u201d said Dorian Slimmerts, another mechanic in the collective who is operating not far from Maseko.",
      "Township mechanics offering a local option for car owners have long battled on the fringes of the country\u2019s commercial auto manufacturing and repair sector. A regulation change in 2020 also made a big difference. New \u201cright to repair\u201d rules in South Africa mean car owners can now have their vehicles serviced by registered independent mechanics and not lose their warranties.",
      "That\u2019s opened the door a little more for township mechanics.",
      "Car maintenance is especially needed in South Africa, where there are around 12 million automobiles on the road and people are keeping their cars longer. The demand for affordable pre-owned cars has outpaced new cars since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Time is the critical element for township mechanics, though. Their businesses see lots of walk-in clients, prices are often negotiated and customers expect quick service \u2014 or they will look elsewhere.",
      "\u201cAll the mechanic sells is time,\u201d said Amanda Gcabashe, managing director of UBU Investment Holdings, an economic advisory company that helped set up the cooperative. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we came with this to say, how do we make sure that we then solve that pain point by making spares easily accessible?\u201d",
      "She said that as well as the business help, the collective is also looking to offer life insurance packages and other social safety net services for its mechanics.",

    "story": [
      "The National Transportation Safety Board is set to hold a public meeting about the door plug panel that blew out during a terrifying Alaska Airlines flight in January of 2024",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday will be focused on preventing another terrifying event like the one involving a panel that flew off a Boeing 737 Max midair in January of 2024.",
      "The board will discuss what NTSB investigators have uncovered over the past 17 months, including their revelation that bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair. Board members were also expected to approve recommendations to keep something similar from ever happening again.",
      "The blow out aboard Alaska Airlines flight 1282 occurred minutes after it took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum that sucked objects out of the cabin and scattered them on the ground below along with debris from the fuselage. Seven passengers and one flight attended received minor injuries, but no one was killed. Pilots were able to land the plane safely back at the airport.",
      "The accident occurred as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression and a few cellphones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane as 171 passengers contended with wind and roaring noise.",
      "The first six minutes of the flight to Southern California\u2019s Ontario International Airport were routine. The Boeing 737 Max 9 was about halfway to its cruising altitude and traveling at more than 400 mph (640 kph) when passengers described a loud \u201cboom\u201d and wind so strong it ripped the shirt off someone\u2019s back.",
      "\u201cWe knew something was wrong,\u201d Kelly Bartlett told The Associated Press in the days following the flight. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what. We didn\u2019t know how serious. We didn\u2019t know if it meant we were going to crash.\u201d",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot (61-centimeter-by-122-centimeter) piece of fuselage covering an unoperational emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "The panel that blew off was made and installed by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. It was removed at a Boeing factory so workers could repair damaged rivets, but bolts that help secure the door plug weren\u2019t replaced. It\u2019s not clear who removed the panel.",
      "The NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented.",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators that they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs that they weren\u2019t qualified for, including opening and closing the door plug on the particular plane involved.",
      "A Boeing door installer said he was never told to take any shortcuts, but everyone faced pressure to keep the assembly line moving.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast,\u201d he told investigators. The installer and other workers were not named in documents about the probe.",
      "The Max version of Boeing\u2019s bestselling 737 airplane has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since two of the jets crashed, one in Indonesia in 2018 and another in Ethiopia in 2019, killing a combined 346 people.",
      "Investigators determined those crashes were caused by a system that relied on a sensor providing faulty readings to push the nose down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department reached a deal allowing Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the Max before the two crashes.",
      "But regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration have capped Boeing's 737 Max production at 38 jets per month while investigators ensure the company has strengthened its safety practices.",
      "Boeing hired a new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, last year and created a new position for a senior vice president of quality to help improve its manufacturing.",
      "The company was back in the news earlier this month when a 787 flown by Air India crashed shortly after takeoff and killed at least 270 people. Investigators have not determined what caused that crash, but so far they have not found any flaws with the model, which has a strong safety record.",

      "The guidance applies to truck and bus drivers engaged in interstate commerce. It aims to improve road safety following incidents in which truck drivers' inability to read signs or speak English may have contributed to traffic deaths, the Transportation Department said.",
      "Requiring truck drivers to speak and read English isn\u2019t new, but the penalty for not meeting the proficiency standard is becoming more severe.",
      "To get a commercial driver\u2019s license, applicants must pass a written test and be able to name the parts of a bus or truck in English as they check tire inflation, tread depth, lug nuts and coolants.",
      "The revised policy reverses guidance issued nine years ago, near the end of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s final term, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In 2016, the agency said drivers whose English skills were found lacking could receive a citation but not be prohibited from working. Before that, the penalty was getting placed on \u201cout-of-service status.\u201d",

      "In Laredo, a border city where many residents speak a mix of English and Spanish, Maldonado\u2019s association is offering free English classes on weekends to help truckers feel more confident in their ability to communicate.",
      "\u201cEverybody knows what a stop sign looks like,\u201d Maldonado said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s construction or if there is an accident five miles down the road, and they have to put up a sign \u2014 \u2018Caution, must exit now, road closed ahead,\u2019 and you are not able to read that or understand that, that could potentially be a safety issue.\u201d",
      "At Driving Academy in Linden, New Jersey, multilingual instructors teach students how to inspect vehicle parts in their first language and then provide explanations in English, according to founder Jonathan Marques. The school created scripts so students could practice what to say if they're stopped, he said.",
      "Students are advised to watch training videos as homework, while licensed truckers can listen to English language apps instead of music when they're on the road, Marques suggested.",
      "Instructor Paul Cuartas helps students prepare but worries that inspectors will now expect truckers and bus drivers to have perfect English. \u201cI\u2019m concerned because now for all the Spanish people it\u2019s more difficult,\u201d he said.",
      "Castillo, who moved to the U.S. from Ecuador in 1993, said he has no problem understanding English but has been watching videos to study industry terms. \u201cSome words I don\u2019t understand, but I try to learn more English,\u201d he said.",

      "Roadside inspections can be initiated over issues such as a faulty brake light or on a routine basis, and often take place at weigh stations.",
      "The guidance directs inspectors who suspect a driver doesn\u2019t understand what they're saying to administer an English proficiency test, which includes both an interview and a highway traffic sign recognition component.",
      "In the past, some drivers used translation apps to communicate with federal inspectors. The updated policy bars the use of interpreters, smartphones, cue cards or other aids during interviews.",
      "Several truck drivers taking a break at Flying J Travel Center in New Jersey said they support Trump's order, adding that drivers who heavily rely on translation programs probably wouldn\u2019t be able to read important signs.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. entry into Israel\u2019s war with Iran has caused travel disruptions to pile up globally.",
      "Following unprecedented bombings ordered by President Donald Trump on three Iranian nuclear and military sites over the weekend, Iran on Monday launched a missile attack on U.S. forces at Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base. Qatar had closed its airspace just hours earlier, after both the U.S. and U.K. also urged their citizens to shelter in place there.",
      "The region has been on edge following the weekend strikes from the U.S. \u2014 and since Israel began the war with a surprise bombardment on Iran, which has responded with its own missile and drone strikes, earlier this month.",
      "As deadly attacks escalated between Israel and Iran, sections of airspace and airports throughout the region have temporarily closed. And airlines canceled more flights in recent days, with some halting select routes through the middle of the week \u2014 particularly in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, just across the Persian Gulf from Iran.",
      "The Middle East carriers were severely affected with cancellations and delays. Qatar Airways said its flights were suspended because of the closure of air traffic in Qatar.",
      "\u201cThe airline is working closely with government stakeholders and the relevant authorities to support impacted passengers, and will resume operations when the airspace reopens,\u201d it said, while warning that delays were likely even after operations resume.",
      "Additional ground staff was sent to Hamad International Airport and other key airports to assist affected passengers, it said.",
      "Emirates suspended all flights to Iran and Iraq, including those serving Baghdad and Basra, until and including Monday 30 June 2025. An unspecified number of other Emirates flights were rerouted but continuing to operate flights as scheduled, using flight paths well distanced from conflict areas. Some flights may be delayed.",
      "Etihad Airways, the other of the two flag carriers of the United Arab Emirates, suspended all flights between Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv through 15 July, and also announced several regional flight cancellations for Monday and Tuesday, including those connecting Abu Dhabi to and from Kuwait, Doha, Dammam and Muscat.",
      "Gulf Air, the carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain, extended the cancellation of scheduled flights to Jordan and until June 27.",
      "\u201cAs the safety of its passengers and crew members remains a top priority, Gulf Air will continue to monitor developments in the region closely, and work with its partners to help accommodate and reroute passengers affected by these flight cancellations,\u201d it said.",
      "Singapore Airlines, for example, canceled some flights to and from Dubai starting Sunday and through Wednesday, citing \u201ca security assessment of the geopolitical situation in the Middle East.\u201d And British Airways has similarly suspended flights to and from Doha through Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSafety is always our highest priority,\u201d British Airways said in a statement confirming its cancellations to The Associated Press, adding that it \u201cwill keep the situation under review.\u201d",
      "Air India on Monday announced it was ceasing \u201call operations to the region as well as to and from the East Coast of North America and Europe\u201d immediately until further notice. The airline, which is still reeling from a plane crash that killed at least 270 people earlier this month, added that India-bound flights from North America were being diverted or rerouted away from closed airspaces.",
      "Air tracking data from FlightAware showed 243 cancellations worldwide as of Tuesday. Dubai International Airport topped the list with 26 cancellations in and out of the airport as of 0600 GMT. And Air India had had the highest amount of cancellations among carriers, totaling 25 at about 0600 GMT.",
      "In other developments, Philippine Airlines canceled several flights to the Middle East, including those to Doha, Dubai and Riyadh for Tuesday and one to Doha Wednesday. Japan Airlines said a flight from Tokyo's Haneda airport to Doha had to return Monday, and subsequently scheduled flights have all been canceled through June 27.",
      "A Qatar Airways flight from Hong Kong to Doha was canceled on Tuesday. Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific said none of its flights enter the airspace of Israel, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan or Lebanon, and their operations to and from the Middle East remain normal.",
      "Such disruptions have snarled travel, particularly as central hubs in the Middle East often connect flights worldwide \u2014 but experts stress that these kind of airspace closures and flight diversions are critical to ensuring safety, especially if future escalation emerges suddenly.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of states, countries to ensure that their airspace is safe for passage of aircraft,\u201d Hassan Shahidi, president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation. He added that on Monday \u201cthe Qataris did the absolutely right thing to close their airspace because of the threat of conflict.\u201d",
      "Beyond Qatari airspace, Flightradar24 reported that UAE airspace was also closed on Monday. After several hours of diversions, flights appeared to be landing and taking off in the country again.",
      "Monday marks the latest \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in this kind of impact, said Ian Petchenik, director of communications at Flightradar24. And while the future is unknown, he added that it's important to remember airspace closures and flight cancellations reflect that \u201cairlines, air traffic controllers and flight crews are doing their best to keep everybody safe.\u201d",
      "Shahidi adds that it's important for travelers to monitor government guidance \u2014 such as safety notices from the U.S. State Department.",
      "How long the war lasts and what, if any, future escalation comes next could carry more widespread implications. Beyond disrupting global flight networks farther down the road, Shahidi stresses that it's very difficult for people who may need or want to evacuate countries impacted by the war to do so without access to commercial flights.",
      "At the same time, he adds, it's critical that state authorities focus on keeping their skies safe \u2014 pointing to past tragedies of passenger flights that were shot down by strikes. That includes Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down by Russian-backed forces while flying over Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people.",
      "\u201cWe are all praying and urging resolution to this conflict \u2014 and especially as it relates to protection of civilian air travel,\" Shahidi said. \"We do not want to have an MH17, with innocent lives being lost in a missile strike ... We do not want to repeat that history.\u201d",

      "Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman on Monday said the central bank should consider cutting its key interest rate as soon as its next meeting in July, underscoring deep divisions among Fed officials as they endure sharp criticism from the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman on Monday said the central bank should consider cutting its key interest rate as soon as its next meeting in July, underscoring deep divisions among Fed officials as they endure sharp criticism from the White House.",
      "Bowman said that President Donald Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, and any upcoming increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\u201cIt is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed, and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\u201d Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \u201cShould inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting,\u201d which is scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "Bowman, who was appointed to the Fed's board of governors by Donald Trump in 2018, is the second high-profile official to express support for a potential July cut in as many days. On Friday, Christopher Waller, also a Trump appointee to the Fed's board, said in a television interview that the Fed should consider cutting borrowing costs next month.",
      "The blunt calls for rate cuts by Waller and Bowman differ from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's suggestion in a news conference last week that the central bank would monitor the economy over the summer and see how inflation responded to tariffs before deciding whether to reduce borrowing costs.",
      "The comments arrive as Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting rates, calling the Fed chair a \u201cnumbskull\u201d and a \u201cfool\u201d for not doing so, raising concerns about the Fed's independence from politics. The president claims Fed cuts would reduce the government\u2019s borrowing costs, though the rates the government pays are mostly set by market forces, not the Fed.",
      "Bowman appeared particularly dismissive toward the threat of tariffs, which many economists say could slow growth, particularly if companies absorb the cost of the duties rather than passing them on to consumers. Doing so would cut their profit margins, which would reduce their ability to hire and invest in new business.",
      "\u201cSmall and one-off price increases this year should translate only into a small drag on real activity,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment will likely boost supply and largely offset any negative effects on economic activity and prices.\u201d",
      "When the Fed lowers the short-term interest rate it controls, it often reduces borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Yet sometimes financial markets keep longer-term rates higher: The Fed cut its rate a full percentage point last year, to about 4.3%, but mortgage rates only declined slighty.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC that with inflation remaining tame and the economy potentially slowing, the Fed should consider a rate cut next month. He pointed to rising unemployment among recent college graduates as a sign of possible weakening in the economy, and said it was better to cut before the labor market noticeably worsened.",
      "\u201cI'm all in favor of saying maybe we should start thinking about cutting the policy rate at the next meeting, because we don\u2019t want to wait until the job market tanks before we start cutting,\u201d Waller said.",
      "Still, at last week's Fed meeting, seven of the 19 officials who participate in the central bank's interest-rate decisions supported keeping rates unchanged for the rest of this year, and two penciled in just one cut.",
      "Inflation has steadily cooled this year despite widespread concerns among economists that Trump's tariffs would boost prices. The consumer price index ticked up just 0.1% from April to May, the government said last week, a sign that price pressures are muted. Prices for some goods rose last month, but the cost for many services such as air fares and hotels fell, offsetting any tariff impact.",
      "Compared with a year ago, prices rose 2.4% in May, up from 2.3% in April.",
      "Trump has slapped a 10% duty on all imports, along with an additional 30% levy on goods from China, 50% on steel and aluminum, and 25% on autos.",
      "Still, many economists say it is likely that tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months. Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested at a news conference last week that the central bank wants to closely monitor how inflation evolves over the next few months before deciding whether to cut rates.",
      "Also Friday, Mary Daly, president of the Fed's San Francisco branch, said on CNBC that she looked \u201cmore to the fall\u201d as an appropriate time to cut rates.",

      "Georgia Power Company completed the first two new nuclear reactors in the country in a generation last year. But Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, cost nearly $35 billion and were powered up some seven years later than initially hoped.",
      "Last month, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation\u2019s largest public power company, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop what it bills as a next-generation nuclear power plant at its Clinch River site in Oak Ridge.

      "European nations worked Monday to keep alive diplomatic efforts to curb the Israel-Iran war as the two countries traded strikes following the United States\u2019 weekend attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program",
      "LONDON -- European nations worked Monday to keep diplomatic efforts to curb the Israel-Iran war alive as the two countries traded strikes following the United States\u2019 weekend attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Calls for Tehran to enter talks with Washington appeared to fall on deaf ears as it reached out to ally Russia for support.",
      "The crisis topped the agenda for European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, where diplomats agonized about the potential for Iranian retaliation to spark a wider war and global economic instability.",
      "\u201cThe concerns of retaliation and this war escalating are huge,\u201d said the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.",
      "Kallas said any attempt by Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz, a key route for global shipping, would be \u201cextremely dangerous and not good for anybody.\u201d",
      "Along with the EU, the \u201cE3\u201d of Britain, France and Germany have led efforts to find a diplomatic solution, holding a tense seven-hour meeting in Geneva on Friday with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. A day after those talks ended with a vague promise to \"meet again in the future,\u201d U.S. bombers struck three Iranian nuclear and military sites.",
      "No further E3 talks with Iran are currently planned, a European diplomatic official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations.",
      "Still, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged Iran to meet the E3 again, and to open negotiations with the United States. Planned U.S.-Iran talks in Oman were scuttled after Israel began attacking Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities on June 13. Iran has since ruled out negotiating while it is under attack.",
      "\u201cTake the off-ramp, dial this thing down and negotiate with the United States immediately and seriously,\" said Lammy, who spoke to both Araghchi and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday.",
      "German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Europe had a role to play, but that \u201ca real precondition for a settlement to the conflict is that Iran be ready to negotiate directly with the U.S.\u201d",
      "Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told reporters in Brussels that he was proposing a meeting between the United States and Iran in Rome.",
      "It was Moscow that Iran reached out to Monday, though, sending Araghchi to meet President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. Putin condemned the United States\u2019 \u201cunprovoked aggression\u201d against Iran and said Russia would help the Iranian people.",
      "Putin said he saw the visit as a chance to explore \u201chow we can get out of today\u2019s situation.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had offered to mediate.",
      "European diplomatic efforts were complicated by a lack of foreknowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s moves. Some countries had no advance notice of the strikes. Britain was notified, but only shortly before bombs fell.",
      "Another hurdle was Trump\u2019s post on social media late Sunday musing about the potential for \u201cregime change\u201d in Iran, despite U.S. officials\u2019 insistence that Washington is not seeking to change the government in Tehran.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot stressed Monday that \u201cwe reject all attempts to organize a change of regime by force.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be illusory and dangerous to think that such a change can be provoked through force and bombs,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb. However, Trump and Israeli leaders have argued that Iran could quickly assemble a nuclear weapon, making it an imminent threat.",
      "The U.S. strikes have brought mixed emotions in European capitals. Amid alarm at the potential for a wider war and calls for de-escalation, some American allies expressed relief that Iran\u2019s nuclear program had been set back.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that the prevention of Iran getting nuclear weapons isn\u2019t a good thing for this country. But we\u2019re prioritizing diplomacy as the way forward,\u201d said Tom Wells, a spokesman for British leader Starmer. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s priority is getting parties back around the table to negotiate a lasting settlement.\u201d",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whose country is a particularly staunch ally of Israel, said he saw \u201cno reason to criticize what Israel began a week ago, and also no reason to criticize what America did last weekend.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged \u201cit is not without risk, but leaving things the way they were was also not an option.\u201d",
      "Merz said he was \u201csomewhat optimistic\u201d that the conflict would not widen. He said Iran\u2019s response so far has been far short \u201cof what we had to fear,\u201d and that Iran\u2019s regional proxies had shown \u201crelatively little\u201d reaction so far.",
      "But he cautioned that \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to stay that way.\u201d",

      "The war between Israel and Iran has raised concerns that Iran could try to close the Strait of Hormuz, the world\u2019s most important oil chokepoint",
      "The war between Israel and Iran has raised concerns that Iran could retaliate by trying to close the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil chokepoint due to the large volumes of crude that pass through it every day.",
      "The U.S. military\u2019s strike on three sites in Iran over the weekend has raised questions about how its military might respond.",
      "The Strait of Hormuz is between Oman and Iran, which boasts a fleet of fast-attack boats and thousands of naval mines as well as missiles that it could use to make the strait impassable, at least for a time.",
      "Iran\u2019s main naval base at Bandar Abbas is on the north coast of the strait. It could also fire missiles from its long Persian Gulf shore, as its allies, Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, have done in the Red Sea.",
      "About 20 million barrels of oil per day, or around 20% of the world\u2019s oil consumption, passed through the strait in 2024. Most of that oil goes to Asia.",
      "Here is a look at the waterway and its impact on the global economy:",
      "The strait connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. It's only 33 kilometers (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point, but deep enough and wide enough to handle the world's largest crude oil tankers.",
      "Oil that passes through the strait comes from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Bahrain, while major supplies of liquefied natural gas come from Qatar. At its narrowest point, the sea lanes for tankers lie in Omani waters, and before and after that cross into Iranian territory.",
      "While some global oil chokepoints can be circumvented by taking longer routes that simply add costs, that's not an option for most of the oil moving through the strait.",
      "That's because the pipelines that could be used to carry the oil on land, such as Saudi Arabia's East-West pipeline, they don't have nearly enough capacity. \u201cMost volumes that transit the strait have no alternative means of exiting the region,\u201d according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "If Iran blocked the strait, oil prices could shoot as high as $120-$130 per barrel, at least temporarily, said Homayoun Falakshahi, head of crude oil analyst at Kpler, in an online webinar Sunday.",
      "That would deal an inflationary shock to the global economy \u2014 if it lasted. Analysts think it wouldn't.",
      "Asia would be directly impacted because 84% of the oil moving through the strait is headed for Asia; top destinations are China, India, Japan and South Korea. China gets 47% of its seaborne oil from the Gulf. China, however, has an oil inventory of 1.1 billion barrels, or 2 1/2 months of supply.",
      "U.S. oil customers would feel the impact of the higher prices but would not lose much supply. The U.S. imported only about 7% of its oil from Persian Gulf countries through the strait in 2024, according to the USEIA. That was the lowest level in nearly 40 years.",
      "Closing the strait would cut off Iran's own oil exports. While Iran does have a new terminal under construction at Jask, just outside the strait, the new facility has loaded oil only once and isn't in a position to replace the strait, according to Kpler analysts.",
      "Closure would hit China, Iran's largest trading partner and only remaining oil customer, and harm its oil-exporting Arab neighbors, who are at least officially supporting it in its war with Israel.",
      "And it would mean blocking Oman's territorial waters, offending a country that has served as a mediator between the U.S. and Iran.",
      "Any price spike would probably not last. One big reason: Analysts expect that the U.S. Navy would intervene to keep the strait open. In the 1980s, U.S. warships escorted Kuwaiti oil tankers through the strait to protect them against Iranian attacks during the Iran-Iraq war.",
      "A price spike \u201cwouldn't last very long\u201d and the strait would likely be reopened \u201cvery fast,\u201d said Kpler's Falakshahi.",
      "U.S. use of force to reopen the strait would likely be supported by Europe and \u201ceven unofficially by China,\u201d he said. \u201cIran's navy would probably get destroyed in a matter of hours or days.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes edged higher in May, as stubbornly high mortgage rates and rising prices made homebuying less affordable even as the inventory of properties on the market continued to increase.",
      "Existing home sales rose 0.8% last month from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.03 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.",
      "Sales fell 0.7% compared with May last year. The latest home sales fell topped the 3.95 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.",
      "\u201cThe sluggish sales activity one can attribute essentially to affordability,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist.",
      "Home prices increased on an annual basis for the 23rd consecutive month, although the rate of growth continued to slow. The national median sales price rose 1.3% in May from a year earlier to $422,800, an all-time high for the month of May.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a slump since early 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Home sales fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, which it set in mid-January, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The low point for this year arrived five weeks ago, when the average rate briefly dropped to 6.62%. Last week, it averaged 6.81%.",
      "Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in April and May, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage ranged from 6.62% to 6.89%.",
      "High mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, remain a key affordability hurdle for many would-be homebuyers. Years of soaring home prices have helped put homeownership out of reach. The median U.S. home sales price is up 52% since May 2019, while the U.S. median annual income has risen 30% in the same period, Yun noted.",
      "While price growth has slowed, elevated mortgage rates and rising prices are forcing prospective homebuyers to save more for a down payment. In May, buyers needed an annual income of $91,960 to afford a typical home with a 20% down payment, or nearly 87% more than in May 2019, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates benefited from a wider selection of properties on the market.",
      "There were 1.54 million unsold homes at the end of last month, a 6.2% increase from April, and 20.3% higher than May last year, NAR said. That\u2019s still well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic, however.",
      "May\u2019s month-end inventory translates to a 4.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from a 4.4-month pace at the end of April and 3.8 months in May last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.",

      "Real estate brokerage company Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow over its policy to ban private home listings",
      "Real estate brokerage company Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow over its policy to ban private home listings.",
      "In a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Compass claims that \u201cZillow has sought to rely on anticompetitive tactics to protect its monopoly and revenues in violation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Compass says that Zillow has implemented an exclusionary policy that says if a home seller and their real estate agent market their property off Zillow for more than one day, that Zillow and its allies, Redfin and eXp Realty, will ban that home from being listed on their search platforms.",
      "\u201cThe Zillow Ban seeks to ensure that all home listings in this country are steered on to its dominant search platform so Zillow can monetize each home listing and protect its monopoly,\u201d Compass said in the lawsuit.",
      "Compass alleges that the \u2018Zillow Ban\u2019 was enacted to prevent rivals from competing against it and reduces homeowner choice.",
      "\u201cIn a free and competitive market, competitors\u2019 products and strategies should rise and fall on merit\u2014not the whims of a monopolist gatekeeper like Zillow,\u201d Compass said.",
      "Compass wants an injunction that would prohibit Zillow from implementing and enforcing its \u2018Zillow Ban\u2019 and implementing and enforcing similar policies. The company also wants a trial by jury and an unspecified amount in damages.",
      "A Zillow spokesperson said in a statement on Monday that the company believes the claims in the lawsuit are unfounded and that it will vigorously defend against them.",
      "\"Our focus remains on creating a level playing field that serves the best interests of everyone in the home buying and selling journey,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "The housing market is always competitive, but has become more fierce of late. Last month the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in April, as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged prospective homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest time of the year for the housing market.",
      "Existing home sales dropped 0.5% in April, from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. The sales decline marked the slowest sales pace for the month of April going back to 2009 in the wake of the U.S. housing crisis. March\u2019s sales pace was also the slowest for that month going back to 2009.",
      "Sales of existing homes barely moved in May, with existing home sales up 0.8% last month from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.03 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Stubbornly high mortgage rates and rising prices made homebuying less affordable even as the inventory of properties on the market continued to increase.",
      "There's also been the issue of more sellers than homebuyers, with potential buyers skittish over high prices and mortgage rates. As of April, the U.S. housing market had nearly 34% more sellers than buyers shopping for a home, according to an analysis by Redfin.",
      "Aside from April 2020, when the pandemic brought the economy and home sales activity to a standstill, there haven\u2019t been this few buyers in the market for a home before, based on records that date back to 2013.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications",
      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz called prior the practice \u201ca pox on the system\u201d that hikes administrative costs during his Senate confirmation hearing in March to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Insurers said Monday that they will standardize electronic prior authorization by the end of next year to help speed up the process. They will reduce the scope of claims subject to it.",
      "They also plan to expand the number of real-time responses and ensure medical reviews are done for denied requests.",
      "Researchers say prior authorization has grown more common as care costs have climbed, especially for prescription drugs, lab testing, physical therapy and imaging exams.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the companies have been unwilling to compromise, so I think any step in the direction of standardization is encouraging,\u201d she said.",

      "If you\u2019ve been laid off, experts recommend that you first take a moment to process and then move on with a plan for your job search.",
      "\u201cA layoff can feel so personal but it\u2019s not a reflection of your value or what you contributed. Especially in the U.S., the work we do is so tied to our identity,\u201d said Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, a financial therapist.",
      "Here are some expert recommendations to help you take care of your finances and your mental health if you've lost your job:",
      "Losing your job can cause a lot of stress and financial anxiety, so it\u2019s important that you take time to emotionally process.",
      "\u201cAcknowledge and normalize that they're going to feel a range of emotions, whether it's anger or sadness,\u201d Bryan-Podvin said.",
      "Whether you are feeling sadness, shock, anger or even relief, taking a moment to feel those emotions can help you move forward.",
      "To make plans for the future, it\u2019s essential that you review your current financial situation, said career coach Marlo Lyons.",
      "If you have a budget, take a closer look and review whether you have expenses that you can temporarily cut to save money. Lyons recommends that you know how long your severance package will last if you\u2019re receiving one.",
      "Applying for unemployment benefits as soon as possible can help alleviate some of the financial stress of a layoff. While the amount you get for unemployment might not be as much as your salary, it can help you to stay afloat for some time, Lyons said.",
      "The Labor Department has tips on applying for unemployment.",
      "Getting laid off from a job can affect your self-esteem, so Bryan-Podvin recommends that you create a list of good qualities about yourself that add to your overall value as a person. Bryan-Podvin calls this a \u201cnon-financial asset list.\"",
      "\u201cIf I were doing a non-financial asset list on myself I might say I\u2019m a pretty good partner and a fun aunt,\u201d she said.",
      "When working with her clients, Bryan-Podvin recommends that they create this list to remind them that their self-worth is part of their net worth.",
      "If you lose your job, you'll need to be more strategic about your spending, said Jesse Mecham, founder of the money management app YNAB.",
      "\u201cIn a layoff, it becomes even more imperative that you treat every dollar with more attention than you have in the past,\u201d Mecham said.",
      "Part of YNAB\u2019s budgeting strategy is giving each dollar a job, whether it is to pay rent, buy groceries or add to your savings account.",
      "When adjusting your spending, Bryan-Podvin also recommends that you approach this with some compassion. Since cutting back can bleed into not doing activities that make you happy, she recommends reminding yourself that this is a temporary pause rather than a permanent change in your lifestyle.",
      "While utilizing your credit card to pay for some expenses is almost inevitable, it\u2019s best to not completely lean on credit while you\u2019re searching for a new job.",
      "\u201cIf getting a new job takes them a little longer than they thought, that credit card has just become an anchor for them,\u201d Mecham said.",
      "Even though unemployment is temporary, Mecham recommends cutting expenses rather than keeping them at the same level and leaning on credit.",
      "Look for community resources, whether that means finding a food bank near you or applying for a temporary hardship program.",
      "\u201cLots of communities offer temporary hardship programs when it comes to necessary bills, such as electricity or water,\u201d Bryan-Podvin said.",
      "USA.Gov offers a benefit finder where you can find available programs and how to apply.",
      "As you are applying to new jobs, Lyons recommends that you take some time to assess if your professional goals are still the same.",
      "If you\u2019re continuing in the same field, Lyons recommends that you make your resume \u201cforward-looking,\u201d which means showing your future employer what you can do, not just what you have done.",
      "\u201cYou want to show the employer what you can do, what unique value you can bring to that particular job that no other candidate can bring because of your previous experience,\u201d Lyons said.",
      "Lyons also recommends that you activate your network by reaching out to past colleagues on LinkedIn or attending industry networking events. Online certifications are another great way to make yourself a better candidate, she added.",
      "Having a routine can help you take care of your mental health and keep a cadence of applying to jobs.",
      "Plan your days so they include eating at your usual time, exercising and applying for jobs for a specific amount of time.",
      "\u201cWhen we are laid off, unemployment can feel really aimless, especially if it came at us kind of out of nowhere,\u201d Bryan-Podvin said.",

      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief. Many retailers across the state also pointed to the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue the industry brings each year.",

      "Global markets appear to have taken the U.S. strike against nuclear targets in Iran in stride as investors await next moves by Iran",
      "BANGKOK -- Global markets appeared to take the U.S. strike against nuclear targets in Iran in stride as investors watched Monday to see how Iran will react.",
      "The price of oil initially jumped more than 2%, fell and then regained about half that much. U.S. stock futures edged lower and share benchmarks in Europe and Asia also were mostly lower.",
      "The attacks on three Iranian sites raised the stakes in the war between Israel and Iran and left questions about what remains of Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. It also increased the possibility that Iran might retaliate, potentially disrupting shipping through the narrow Strait of Hormuz, a waterway through which much of the world\u2019s crude oil passes.",
      "The big unknown is what Iran will do, analysts said.",
      "The price of Brent crude oil, the international standard, was up 1.2% at $77.91 per barrel. U.S. benchmark crude climbed 1.3% to $74.79.",
      "The future for the S&P 500 was little changed, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%. Treasury yields were steady.",
      "In Europe, Germany's DAX lost 0.5% to 23,230.54 and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.6% to 7,541.25. Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.2% to 8,761.53.",
      "Overall, there was no sign of panic.",
      "\u201cI believe what we are thinking is or the thinking is that it is going to be a short conflict. The one big hit by the Americans will be effective and then we\u2019ll get back to sort of business as usual, in which case there is no need for an immediate, panicky type of reaction,\u201d said Neil Newman, managing director of Atris Advisory Japan.",
      "The conflict began with an Israeli attack against Iran on June 13 that sent oil prices yo-yoing and rattled other markets.",
      "Closing off the Strait of Hormuz would be technically difficult but it could severely disrupt transit through it, sending insurance rates spiking and making shippers nervous to move without U.S. Navy escorts. As a major oil producer, Iran may be reluctant to close down the waterway, which is used to transport its own crude, mostly to China. Oil is a major revenue source for the regime.",
      "\u201cThe situation remains highly fluid, and much hinges on whether Tehran opts for a restrained reaction or a more aggressive course of action,\u201d Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, said in a commentary.",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said disrupting traffic through the strait would be \u201ceconomic suicide\" and would elicit a U.S. response.",
      "\"I would encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that because they heavily depend on the Strait of Hormuz for their oil,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "When asked about that at a routine briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing that \u201cChina is willing to strengthen communication with Iran and relevant parties to continue playing a constructive role in promoting de-escalation\" of the conflict.",
      "\"The Persian Gulf and its adjacent waters are important international channels for cargo and energy trade. Maintaining security and stability in this region serves the common interests of the international community,\" he said.",
      "Tom Kloza, chief market analyst at Turner Mason & Co said he expects Iranian leaders to refrain from drastic measures and oil futures to ease back after the initial fears blow over.",
      "Disrupting shipping would be \" a scorched earth possibility, a Sherman-burning-Atlanta move,\u201d Kloza said.",
      "Writing in a report, Ed Yardeni, a long-time analyst, agreed that Tehran leaders would likely hold back.",
      "\u201cThey aren\u2019t crazy,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors Sunday. \u201cThe price of oil should fall and stock markets around the world should climb higher.\u201d",
      "Other experts weren't so sure.",
      "Countries are not always rational actors and Tehran could lash out for political or emotional reasons, said Andy Lipow, a Houston analyst who has covered oil markets for 45 years.",
      "\u201cIf the Strait of Hormuz was completely shut down, oil prices would rise to $120 to $130 a barrel,\u201d Lipow said. That would translate to about $4.50 a gallon at the pump and hurt consumers in other ways, he said.",
      "Much of East Asia depends on oil imported through the strait. Taiwan's Taiex fell 1.4% while the Kospi in South Korea slipped 0.2%.",
      "In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% lower, with gains for defense contractors, oil companies and miners helping to make up for broad losses.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. strike on Iran certainly is very good for defense equipment,\u201d Newman of Atris Advisory said, noting that both Japan and South Korea have sizable military manufacturing hubs.",
      "Australia's S&P/ASX fell 0.4%.",

      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Mac does not set out to bite the hand that feeds in a new play satirizing cultural philanthropy. The MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d recipient claims to be \u201cjust trying to get some lipstick on it.\"",
      "Set at a not-for-profit dance company\u2019s gala, \"Prosperous Fools\" invites questions about the moral value of philanthropy in a society denounced by the comedy as \u201cfeudal.\u201d A boorish patron goes mad trying vainly to wield his lacking creative capital and thus confirms the choreographer's fears of selling out to a sleazy oligarch who represents everything his art opposes. The show, written by Mac and directed by Darko Tresnjak, runs through June 29 at Brooklyn's Polonsky Shakespeare Center.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to hurt anybody. I\u2019m trying to get people to think differently about the world,\u201d said Mac, whose gender pronoun is \u201cjudy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just wish that all of the great philanthropists of America, and the world, would lead with, \u2018This is a temporary solution until we can figure out how to make a government of the people, for the people, by the people,'\" Mac added. \"Instead of, \u2018This is the solution: I should have all the money and then I get to decide how the world works.\u2019\u201d",
      "Don't let present day parallels distract you. The fundraiser's honored donor enters atop a fire-breathing bald eagle in a black graphic tee, blazer and cap much like Elon Musk's signature White House getup. He later dons the long red tie popular in MAGA world. But the resemblance doesn't mean Mac is meditating solely on recent events such as President Donald Trump's billionaire-filled administration and tightening grip over cultural pillars including the Kennedy Center.",
      "The script reflects personal frustrations with philanthropy\u2019s uneven power dynamics navigated throughout a 30-year career spent in what Mac described as \u201ca million handshaking ceremonies,\" first as a cater-waiter and eventually as one of the celebrated honorees who donates performances to help fundraise.",
      "Mac\u2019s desperate portrayal of the artist at the center of \u201cProsperous Fools\u201d only sharpens its skewering of wealthy philanthropists who take more than they give away. When the artist cries \u201cBut why couldn\u2019t I have a good oligarch?\u201d and bemoans that \u201cI should have stayed in the artistic integrity of obscurity,\u201d it feels like a case of art imitating life.",
      "Mainstream success came last decade for Mac. \u201cA 24-Decade History of Popular Music\u201d was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2017 and Mac's Broadway debut play \u201cGary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus\u201d racked up seven Tony nominations in 2019.",
      "\u201cProsperous Fools,\u201d however, was written 12 years ago before much of the critical acclaim. Mac said \u201csomeone with power\u201d commissioned a translation of French playwright Moli\u00e8re\u2019s \u201cLe Bourgeois Gentilhomme,\u201d which mocks a status-obsessed middle class social climber.",
      "Mac isn't surprised the original commissioner didn't want the final product. Moli\u00e8re is hardly present. And the play essentially advocates for an end to the perpetuation of culture that only the affluent deem worthy of funding.",
      "Mac is also unsurprised it took over a decade to land another interested producer. The initial 40-person ballet troupe had to be shrunk to a more affordable ensemble of four dancers. Plus, its style, in Mac's judgment, is still rather \u201cqueer\u201d for a \u201cheteronormative\u201d theater industry.",
      "\u201cAnd then the other reason is because I insult donors,\" Mac said.",
      "\u201cI don't think I insult donors,\" Mac added. \"I ask donors to consider. And the theater is entrenched in making sure their donors feel good about themselves \u2014 not that their donors are in collaboration with us for us all to get to a place of better consciousness.\u201d",
      "The show's slapstick humor helps break down its fairly cerebral subject matter. In one of several moments of hilarity, the patron and his \u201cphilanthropoid\u201d \u2014 the ballet's artistic director, whose primary concern is securing donations \u2014 sway around the stage oinking like pigs. Mac's artist delivers scathing and highbrow critiques while pretending to be \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d actor Wallace Shawn in a puppet costume. The gala's other honoree \u2014 a star singer called the \u201cpatron saint of philanthropy\" who wears a gown adorned with impoverished children's faces \u2014 makes no bones about her lust for Shawn.",
      "But, as Mac knows, nonstop humor can have the effect of softening its target. \u201cProsperous Fools\u201d foregoes the actors' bows that typically end a play in favor of an epilogue, delivered by the artist in rhyming couplets, that serves as the show's final blow to \u201cphilanthrocapitalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to be a tender heart in this too tough world trying to figure out how to maintain my tenderness and how to create revolution with tenderness. And I\u2019m at a loss for it right now,\" Mac said. \"Part of what the play is doing is saying, \u2018I\u2019m at a loss. Are you? Do you have a solution for me?\u2019\u201d",
      "By skipping the curtain call, Mac practically demands that the crowd wrestle immediately with whether charity absolves wealth hoarders' greed \u2014 a question boldly put forth at the close of a Theatre for a New Audience season sponsored by Deloitte and Bloomberg Philanthropies.",
      "But whether the show's heavy-handed message has reached those financial backers remains to be seen. \u201cNo one's spoken to me,\" Mac said. Neither responded to requests for comment.",

      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, that began Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk seemed jubilant Sunday morning, posting on X, \u201cThe @Tesla_AI robotaxi launch begins in Austin this afternoon with customers paying a $4.20 flat fee!\u201d",
      "The test is beginning modestly enough. Tesla is remotely monitoring the vehicles and putting a person in the passenger seat in case of trouble. The number of Teslas deployed will also be small \u2014 just 10 or 12 vehicles \u2014 and will only pick up passengers in a limited, geofenced area.",
      "Musk has vowed that the service will quickly spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

    "summary": "A federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration&rsquo;s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard's ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard's legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard's ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.",
      "Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school\u2019s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard\u2019s roughly 7,000 international students \u2014 about a quarter of its total enrollment \u2014 to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.",
      "The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House\u2019s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government's action hours after Harvard sued.",
      "Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump's proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.",
      "\u201cWe expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,\u201d Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. \u201cOur Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.\u201d",
      "The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America's oldest and wealthiest university.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of \u201cprofound fear, concern, and confusion,\u201d the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.",
      "Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they\u2019ll be able to attend the university.",
      "For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn't refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration's policies, she still hasn't heard back.",
      "\u201cYour personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,\u201d Huang said in a social media post. \u201cWhy does it have to be so hard to go to school?\u201d",
      "Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address \u201ctheir largescale improprieties\" and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. \u201cThey have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\u201d Trump's post said.",
      "Trump's administration first targeted Harvard's international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard\u2019s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world\u2019s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard\u2019s reputation as a global research hub. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard\u2019s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its \u201ccore, legally-protected principles,\u201d even after receiving federal ultimatums.",

      "Badain went through a similar process when serving in the same capacity for the NFL's Raiders. He was a central figure in that team\u2019s move from Oakland to Las Vegas in 2020 as well as the approval and construction of $2 billion Allegiant Stadium.",
      "While waiting for Allegiant Stadium to be finished, the Raiders remained in Oakland for three seasons in the stadium they shared with the A's. But while the Raiders maintained a largely strong connection to the Bay Area even while playing as a lameduck franchise, A's fans were incensed about their team's impending departure and the process involved.",
      "That made staying in Oakland untenable for the franchise, which played its final season in the dilapidated stadium last year. The A's are playing the first of at least three years about an hour away at a Triple-A ballpark in West Sacramento, California, while they await their move to Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cWe are a local team,\u201d Fisher said. \"And we want to start from the youngest of fans, because if you can get the kids, you can get their parents. It takes less time than you think; what really takes time is ... to have a winner.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to continue to build upon what we have, and building a team is like building anything else. Sometimes it takes more time than you want it to. It\u2019s like building the stadium. And we think that we have the pieces to make ourselves really successful.\u201d",
      "The stadium will be built on nine acres of the 35-acre site owned by Bally\u2019s on the corner of Tropicana Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard. The Tropicana\u2019s resort towers were destroyed in an overnight demolition in October to clear the way for the ballpark.",
      "The A's are trying to strike a balance of making the most of their temporary home while also preparing for their future. Each A's player wears a patch of Sacramento's Tower Bridge on one sleeve and a Las Vegas logo on the other as part of a three-year sponsorship with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "The Las Vegas Stadium Authority in December approved lease, non-relocation and development documents, the last major steps for the A's to eventually become Las Vegas' team.",
      "Artist renderings show a stadium with its five overlapping layers that bears a striking resemblance to Australia's famed Sydney Opera House. A glass window beyond the outfield provides an outdoor feel with views of the Las Vegas Strip. Rather than a centralized cooling system, air conditioning will be distributed through the seats.",
      "This will be MLB's smallest stadium, though Tropicana Field where the Tampa Bay Rays usually call home has a capacity of 25,000 when the upper levels are closed off. It otherwise holds just less than 40,000 seats.",
      "The Rays, like the A's, are playing this season at a Triple-A ballpark after Hurricane Milton damaged their domed stadium. Tampa Bay's long-term home is unknown, and the club could soon be in the hands of new owners.",
      "Cleveland plays at Progressive Field, which now seats 34,830. It was downsized from the 43,345-seat capacity when the park opened in 1994.",
      "The A\u2019s are set to become the fourth major professional team in Las Vegas, joining the Raiders, NHL\u2019s Golden Knights and WNBA\u2019s Aces.",
      "\u201cI think that the demographics, the success that other sports have had, and the amount of tourism here, those three legs of the stool make this an ideal market for us,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cI have no doubt that this team is going to be really successful in Vegas.\u201d",

    "summary": "Haoxi Simon Wang was 12 when he left his family behind in Beijing to move to Toronto and pursue his passion to play hockey",
    "story": [
      "Haoxi Simon Wang was 12 when he left his family behind in Beijing to move to Toronto and pursue his passion to play hockey",
      "Invited to watch his first hockey practice at an ice rink in Beijing, Haoxi Wang was no different than any impressionable, wide-eyed 4-year-old being fascinated by the equipment the players wore.",
      "They resembled superheroes with sticks, uniforms and bulging pads, their faces hidden behind helmeted cages. This was before the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, when hockey was a niche sport in China and the NHL a mere pipe dream.",
      "\u201cIt was definitely the gear,\u201d the 6-foot-5, 215-pound \u2014 and still growing \u2014 defenseman who goes by Simon recalled at the NHL pre-draft scouting combine in Buffalo earlier this month.",
      "\u201cSomething just clicked inside of me, and I just fell in love with the game,\u201d Wang added. \u201cRight away, I told my mom I need to get out there as soon as possible. And I probably went on the ice the next day or so.\u201d",
      "This marked the start of a journey that saw a 12-year-old Wang move to Toronto and work his way up the junior ranks to play for the OHL Oshawa Generals. At 17, he is considered a candidate to be an early to mid-round pick in the NHL draft in Los Angeles this weekend.",
      "\u201cI think this is a dream come true moment for me,\u201d said Wang, ranked 34th on NHL Central Scouting\u2019s list of North American skaters. \u201cIf I told myself four, five years ago that I\u2019ll be here, the NHL combine, I\u2019d probably tell myself I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s not.",
      "Based on Wang\u2019s size and skating ability, there\u2019s likely to be even more pinch-me moments ahead for someone in position to become just the third Chinese-born player \u2014 and potentially highest \u2014 selected in the NHL draft.",
      "Andong Song, chosen 172nd overall by the New York Islanders in 2015, was the first Chinese-born player drafted. Song never played professionally following two seasons with the USHL's Madison Capitols.",
      "Then there\u2019s Kevin He, also from Beijing, who is on path to playing in the NHL. Drafted 109th by Winnipeg last year, He signed a three-year entry level contract with the Jets in December.",
      "Kevin He had the advantage of playing organized hockey at 6 when his family moved to Montreal. By comparison, Wang\u2019s true introduction to the sport competitively came with his arrival in Toronto at the urging of a friend who made the move earlier to pursue hockey.",
      "It was a culture shock for Wang, who left his family behind and couldn't speak English.",
      "\u201cI think courage would be the word, I would describe it,\u201d Oshawa general manager Roger Hunt said. \u201cThe only language he knew was hockey. And he wanted to play. And he had the vision at that age to say, \u2018Hey, if I want to do this, I better go there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Wang proved to be a quick study. Though raw, his ability almost immediately caught everyone\u2019s attention.",
      "The only question for Hunt in selecting Wang in the fifth round of the 2023 OHL 16-year-old draft was his eligibility in having already committed to Boston University. The NCAA previously barred CHL players from competing at the college ranks before eliminating its rule in November.",
      "Wang made his debut with Oshawa in December. Though he finished with a modest five assists in 53 games on a team that lost to London in the OHL finals, Wang did not look out of place.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would have went into that arena and said, \u2018Hey, this kid\u2019s only played hockey five years,\u2019\u201d Hunt said. \u201cHe\u2019s got such good feet, he skates so well, his edges, everything.\u201d",
      "Next year, Hunt projects Wang to take on a larger role as Oshawa's top defenseman. Wang is ahead of schedule, in part due to the NCAA rule change.",
      "The initial plan last season, his agent John Walters said, was to have Wang stay in the OJHL, where he was already showing signs of dominating with four goals and 22 points in 38 games.",
      "Walters said it was at Wang\u2019s urging to make the jump to OHL to spur his development against better competition.",
      "\u201cI had a couple of NHL teams saying, \u2018You should have left him in junior, because there would have been that wonderment about him.\u2019 And I said, \u2018But that wouldn\u2019t have made him better,'\u201d Walters said. \u201cSimon doesn\u2019t care whether he goes in the first, second or third round. He wants to get better. He needed to go challenge himself.\u201d",
      "It was Walters who took Wang under his wing early after his arrival in Canada, with Walters\u2019 father chauffeuring the player to practices and games. Another benefit was Wang\u2019s mother, Willa, who was so inspired by her son\u2019s passion for hockey, she became an ice-rink developer in China and she eventually purchased the Ontario Junior Hockey League team where her son played.",
      "The plan for Wang now is to compete in the OHL next season before making the jump to Boston University, where his older brother completed his post-graduate studies.",
      "\u201cWhen I was 12, I had a very naive belief in me that I\u2019m going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here right now and not taking any moment for granted. I\u2019m still learning, and I might be still behind a lot of guys, but my potential and what I can become as a player, that\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting about me.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m excited for the next part of my story,\" Mullin told Wigan's official website on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve scored a lot of goals over the last few years, but more than anything, I give my absolute all for the club that I\u2019m playing for, and I\u2019m going to do that again with Wigan.\u201d",
      "Wigan said the loan deal was subject to the approval of the English Football League and the Football Association, and international clearance.",
      "Mullin helped Wrexham become the first team in the history of English football\u2019s top five divisions to secure three successive promotions, and there is a giant mural of the 30-year-old striker in the center of the city.",
      "He formed such a close bond with Ryan Reynolds, one of the club\u2019s owners, that he even appeared in the last \u201cDeadpool\u201d movie.",
      "But Mullin, who had been Wrexham's player of the season in each of the three previous years, was only a bit-part performer when the team won promotion to the second tier last season.",

      "McElhenney once hailed Mullin as \u201cone of the greatest football players in the world.\u201d",

      "The game changed over the decades, and so did the Tigers. They still have plenty of offense, but pitching is the name of the game in the bayou nowadays.",

      "Totally awesome, baby?",
      "Forget all the upset specials in March.",
      "NASCAR will find out soon enough if its attempt to snap out of a mid-summer malaise with its first in-season tournament is a success with drivers and fans as it strives to boost engagement and build buzz in the staid regular season.",
      "The concept has already juiced enthusiasm in NASCAR to levels not seen since the halcyon days when Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough duked it out in the 1979 Daytona 500.",
      "\u201cTo be really honest with you,\u201d 2020 NASCAR champion Chase Elliott said, \u201cI have not paid any attention to it.\u201d",
      "Maybe a look at the matchup will get NASCAR\u2019s most popular driver pumped!",
      "Elliott is seeded fifth against No. 28 seed Austin Dillon in the first round of the head-to-head showdown in the race-within-the-race set for this weekend at the track better known as Atlanta Motor Speedway.",
      "Here\u2019s a refresher for Elliott and any other sports fan who missed out on the specifics of NASCAR joining the in-season tournament party, much like attempts in the NBA, NHL, and, of course, throughout the world in soccer.",
      "NASCAR is set to start the engines on a five-race, bracket-style tournament called the In-Season Challenge in the midst of the summer slate, which comes with a $1 million prize to the winner.",
      "The final 32-driver field was set by results of the last three races at Michigan, Mexico City and Pocono. The drivers are paired in head-to-head matchups based on seeding, with the winners advancing to the next round in a bracket format that mirrors the NCAA basketball tournaments.",
      "Buoyed by a win at Michigan and a runner-up finish at Pocono, Denny Hamlin earned the top seed. He\u2019ll square off \u2014 race off? \u2014 against No. 32 seed Ty Dillon. Pocono winner Chase Briscoe is the No. 2 seed and is pitted against No. 31 seed Noah Gragson.",
      "Chris Buescher is third, Christopher Bell fourth and Elliott fifth, among notable names.",
      "The format is single elimination with the field cut to 16 at the street race in Chicago, eight at Sonoma, four on the lone concrete track in the series at Dover and the final two over the yard of bricks at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.",
      "The Challenge is part of NASCAR\u2019s media rights deal that includes TNT, and the Atlanta-based cable network will broadcast all five races in the tournament, starting with the 400-miler in Atlanta.",
      "Aside from a shrug from Elliott and a few others, drivers are intrigued by the idea of increasing the stakes in each race beyond a playoff berth, trophy and the winner\u2019s purse.",
      "\u201cI love it. I think it\u2019s great,\u201d three-time Cup champion Joey Logano said. \u201cI think it\u2019s placed perfectly where it is in the season. This is kind of that moment where the newness is worn off. We\u2019re into the rhythm, we\u2019re racing every week. It\u2019s starting to start a little bit of, who\u2019s going to be in the playoffs, who\u2019s not, the cutoff line all those types of things. But it\u2019s not really the main story quite yet.\u201d",
      "Stories are what sell, of course, and the sizzle in Pocono over the weekend had little to do with which drivers or teams are the ones to beat for the 2025 championship. Rather, it was whether two pedestrian drivers were going to fight, the end of Amazon Prime's run of wildly-popular telecasts and Hall of Fame driver Dale Earnhardt Jr.\u2019s win in his first race as a crew chief.",
      "\u201cThis really spices up the mid-part of the season,\u201d Logano said.",
      "So does placing a few bucks on No. 11 to win.",
      "But as of Monday afternoon, most sports gambling sites did not offer odds on specific matchups headed into Atlanta. NASCAR is offering $1 million to a winning fan with a perfect bracket in its fantasy game.",
      "There are some quirks to the bracket: Shane van Gisbergen won the Cup race in Mexico City and is not in the field while series points leader William Byron is only a No. 9 seed. The tournament boasts matchups in the first-round of past Cup champions (Kyle Busch-Brad Keselowski), former teammates (Briscoe-Gragson), and even best friends (Bubba Wallace-Daniel Suarez).",
      "The idea for the challenge was largely championed by Hamlin, a three-time Daytona 500 champion who floated the idea of a mid-season tournament on his \u201cActions Detrimental\" podcast. When NASCAR bought into the idea and announced the creation of the tournament last year, Hamlin called the tournament on social media \u201csuch a win for our sport and drivers.\u201d He jokingly added, \u201cI will collect my 1M royalty next season.\u201d",
      "Hamlin's on deck and clearly a favorite to win it all, with three wins this year for Joe Gibbs Racing and the top seed.",
      "(And let's not haggle over who gets credit in court.)",

      "LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- The first female and first African president of the IOC, Kirsty Coventry, was inaugurated in the role Monday on the organization's 131st birthday with praise that the Olympic movement was \u201cin the best of hands.\u201d",
      "Coventry, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming for Zimbabwe, finally and formally takes office Tuesday aged just 41 after decisively winning a seven-candidate election in March to succeed Thomas Bach.",
      "Coventry cited her family including her two young daughters as \u201cmy rocks, my inspiration\u201d to lead the International Olympic Committee through the next eight years including the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cYou are my constant reminders of why we do what we do every single day,\u201d Coventry said, addressing six-year-old Ella seated near the front of the ceremony",
      "\u201cYou are a constant reminder of why this movement is relevant, why it needs to change, why we need to embrace the new ways,\u201d the new president said. \u201cAnd you will be a constant reminder for many years to come on the decisions that we all take together.\u201d",
      "She thanked her husband, Tyrone Seward, because \"you have always stood by my side and never said \u2018No.\u2019 And I appreciate that because that is something that doesn\u2019t come very often.\u201d",

      "The promise came three years ago from Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The promise came three years ago from Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti. It might have been overlooked for a couple of reasons. One, the Thunder were awful at the time. Two, he was speaking Latin.",
      "\u201cLabor omnia vincit,\u201d Presti said after the 2021-22 season, quoting a motto of Oklahoma. Depending on how Presti was translating it, it could have been \u201chard work conquers all\u201d or \u201cslow work conquers all.\u201d",
      "Either way, it applies to the Thunder. They did hard work. They did slow work.",
      "They conquered all.",
      "The Thunder \u2014 three years removed from winning 24 games \u2014 won 84 games this season and are NBA champions after beating the Indiana Pacers in a seven-game NBA Finals slugfest. For the rest of the NBA, this should be a scary development. They have the MVP in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He and all of Oklahoma City\u2019s key players are under contract for next season, there\u2019s a 2024 lottery pick in Nikola Topic who didn\u2019t even play this season because of a torn ACL and the Thunder currently have two picks in the top 24 in this year\u2019s draft as well.",
      "They are young; their starters, right now, are 27, 26, 26, 24 and 23. They are bold. And they might \u2014 should \u2014 be contending for a while.",
      "\u201cWe definitely still have room to grow,\u201d said Gilgeous-Alexander, the MVP, the NBA Finals MVP, the league\u2019s scoring champion and now, an NBA champion as well. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun part of this. So many of us can still get better. There\u2019s not very many of us on the team that are in our prime or even close to it. We have a lot to grow, individually and as a group. I\u2019m excited for the future of this team. This is a great start, for sure.\u201d",
      "And the timing of them hitting this sort of stride is pretty good, too.",
      "Plenty of teams have questions going into next season. Oklahoma City isn\u2019t one of them. Jayson Tatum in Boston, Damian Lillard in Milwaukee and now Tyrese Haliburton in Indiana all have Achilles injuries and figure to miss most if not all of next season. The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James will be going into his 23rd season. Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry is turning 38 next season. Kevin Durant, now of Houston (in a trade that\u2019s going to be official in the coming weeks), is going into his 18th season. Philadelphia\u2019s hopes hinge on Joel Embiid coming back healthy. New York will be dealing with a coaching change.",
      "Oklahoma City seems to have everything right in place.",
      "\u201cThey have a lot of great players on this team,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.",
      "Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren all seem to enjoy playing with and off one another, none of them caring who gets credit. Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein fit seamlessly into the roles the Thunder asked them to play. Luguentz Dort is a defensive machine and has come to realize that most people don\u2019t have the ability to appreciate how good he is at that end.",
      "It\u2019s not just the players who don\u2019t care about puffing out their own chests. Same goes for the leadership.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not guaranteed anything in the league,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest thing that happens year to year that people forget about. Any moment your team can change with a trade, with an injury, with something that\u2019s out of your control. To be able to get to the pinnacle of this sport and win it is nothing short of extraordinary. To think that you can just walk in and do it every single year is a little bit na\u00efve. Rest assured, we\u2019ll show up Day 1 next year ready to get better and ready to chase this again.\u201d",
      "Presti, the architect of it all, rarely speaks publicly. Same goes for Clay Bennett, the owner. And coach Mark Daigneault is the calm in the eye of any storm, the perfect driver of the Thunder bus.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee you end it the way that we did,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cI just wanted it so bad for them. I was just so thrilled that we were able to get that done and they get to experience this because they deserve it. The way they approach it, the professionalism, competitiveness, team-first nature, like I said, I wanted it so bad for them.\u201d",
      "The journey isn\u2019t over for the Thunder. It\u2019s just starting. Presti has a war chest filled with draft picks and the team has some financial flexibility to add a piece if it so chooses. And now there\u2019s a title to defend.",
      "Labor omnia vincit. There\u2019s more work to do.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of hard work in front of us,\u201d Presti said that day in 2022. \u201cWe have to grind in and do it. That\u2019s what the state is about. That\u2019s what the history of the community is about. That\u2019s what the basketball team here is about.\u201d",

      "Since then, they've been thoroughly mediocre, and even an improved stretch recently hasn't helped their outlook much for 2025.",
      "After losing two of three to the Yankees in New York, the Orioles are 11 games under .500. They've gone 17-10 over their last 27, so perhaps the worst is over, but over the last 162 regular-season games, Baltimore is 75-87. It's a remarkable decline for a team that won 101 games in 2023, started 49-25 last year and had a core of standouts that was young and cost controlled.",
      "Injuries have been a major factor, with catcher and former No. 1 overall draft pick Adley Rutschman the latest big name to go on the IL. Right-hander Grayson Rodriguez hasn't pitched at all this year. Zach Eflin has made only 11 starts with a 5.46 ERA, and outfielder Colton Cowser and infielder Jordan Westburg have missed significant time as well.",
      "The front office has received little sympathy following an offseason in which ace Corbin Burnes departed and the Orioles replaced him with stopgap solutions on one-year deals.",
      "Although Baltimore is just 6 1/2 games out of a postseason spot, FanGraphs isn't a believer, giving the Orioles just a 3.7% chance of making the playoffs. Baltimore is one of five 2024 postseason participants that would miss out if this season ended today. Here are the others:",
      "SAN DIEGO (42-35 record, 39.3% postseason chance according to FanGraphs): The Padres are a half-game behind resurgent Milwaukee for the last spot in the National League playoffs. San Diego has been treading water since a 23-11 start, and its division just became more interesting after San Francisco acquired Rafael Devers.",
      "CLEVELAND (39-37, 34.1%): The Guardians are tied for the final American League spot but would lose a head-to-head tiebreaker to Seattle if the season ended now. Detroit has opened an 8 1/2-game lead in the AL Central, so unless Cleveland can cut into that significantly, it'll be a wild card or bust for the Guardians down the stretch.",
      "ATLANTA (35-41, 27.3%): The talent is there, but this past week was typical for the 2025 Braves, who followed up a three-game sweep of the Mets by losing two of three to Miami.",
      "KANSAS CITY (38-40, 20.0%): Bobby Witt Jr. can only do so much \u2014 only the Pirates have scored fewer runs than the Royals. But the bar in the AL is low, and Kansas City can probably stay in the mix.",
      "In honor of the NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder, name the five current major league franchises that have won the World Series in multiple cities.",
      "Clarke Schmidt threw seven hitless innings for the New York Yankees on Saturday in their 9-0 win over Baltimore. The Orioles managed only one hit on the day \u2014 against the New York bullpen.",
      "The Orioles led 8-0 in the third inning at Tampa Bay on Wednesday before the Rays stormed back to win 12-8. Tampa Bay had a 2% chance to win at the start of the third according to Baseball Savant.",
      "Yennier Cano allowed four runs in the fifth to tie the game, and he was sent down to the minors later in the week. Andrew Kittredge then allowed four in the seventh.",
      "That's the issue for the Orioles. Will their pitching allow the kind of hot streak they'd need to jump back into the playoff race?",
      "The Athletics (Philadelphia and Oakland), Braves (Boston, Milwaukee and Atlanta), Dodgers (Brooklyn and Los Angeles), Giants (New York and San Francisco) and Twins (Washington and Minnesota).",

      "\u201cMove on,\u201d Pochettino said of the goalkeeper's botched clearing attempt before Patrick Agyemang's tiebreaking 75th-minute goal in a 2-1 victory over Haiti on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cRemember, the most important action is the next one,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIf you think in the last one like that, you\u2019re going to do another mistake. This type of accident happened, and it will happen it the future.\u201d",
      "The immediate future for the U.S. after a 3-0 run through Group D is a quarterfinal against Costa Rica or Mexico next weekend. Either way, the opponent will be ranked higher than any of th group opponents.",
      "The U.S. ended a four-match losing streak by beating No. 100 Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 in its Gold Cup opener, followed by a 1-0 victory over 58th-ranked Saudi Arabia. Haiti is No. 83.",
      "\u201cThe confidence level is super high,\u201d said Brenden Aaronson, who assisted on Malik Tillman's goal that opened the scoring in the 10th minute. \u201cI mean, nine points from three games. We\u2019ve had two shutouts and another win today against a good Haiti team. I think we\u2019re really flying at the moment. Now we have a week to prepare, which we haven\u2019t had for any team.\u201d",
      "Still, the play has been uneven from what amounts to a B team of mostly young and unproven players and A team backups. Several of the usual stars and starters sat out for personal reasons, injuries or playing in the Club World Cup.",
      "Missing the tournament for the U.S. are regulars Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Sergi\u00f1o Dest.",
      "\u201cWe were not a clinic with the chances that we had,\u201d Pochettino said of the Haiti win. \u201cI think we should have scored more.\u201d",
      "Freese blundered when took a back pass from Tim Ream and tried to play the ball to John Tolkin with his left foot. The ball went straight to Louicius Don Deedson, who took a touch and scored inside the far post for a 1-1 tie in the 19th minute.",
      "The unsightly moment did nothing to dissuade Pochettino, who suggested his decision to go with Freese over Matt Turner will continue in this Gold Cup. The coach thought Freese followed orders by moving on.",
      "\u201cContinues to build me up,\u201d Freese said of Pochettino. \u201cThat\u2019s something I really appreciate. Very grateful for the opportunity. I just want to help the team win as much as I can.\u201d",
      "The U.S. won its group for the 17th time in 18 Gold Cups. The Americans have 43 wins, one loss and five draws in group play, going 3-0 for the seventh time. Still, a four-match losing streak punctuated by a Switzerland's 4-0 blowout in the final Gold Cup tune-up is a not-very-distant memory.",
      "\u201cTo be the best, you\u2019ve got to beat the best,\u201d Freese said. \u201cI think always continuing to push ourselves and play against harder teams and show what we can do and learn from it and continue to grow as a group ahead of a big summer next summer is an opportunity we\u2019re all looking forward to. We want to continue to move on.\u201d",

      "CROMWELL, Conn. -- J.J. Spaun knows as well as anyone how one little shot can make such a huge difference, even if it's only 85 yards to a green in the shape of a red umbrella floating in the middle of a lake.",
      "It wasn't a shot that won the U.S. Open. Spaun will be remembered far more for the driver he hit onto the 17th green at Oakmont to take the lead, and for the 65-foot putt on the last hole to cap off his sensational birdie-birdie finish at golf's toughest test.",
      "This shot was five years ago at the Travelers Championship. It was no less important to Spaun, who has Type 1 diabetes but didn't know it at the time.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Andy Bessette, the executive vice president and chief administrative officer at Travelers Insurance, and a familiar face behind the tournament. \u201cNot everything in life is for a reason, but at times you have to step back and think it's too weird it happened that way.\u201d",
      "A 15-year tradition at the Travelers is \u201cThe Umbrella at 15 1/2 Challenge,\u201d where players during the pro-am hit an 85-yard shot at the umbrella that sits in the lake between the 15th and 16th holes at the TPC River Highland. The closest to the pin is given $10,000 to donate to charity.",
      "It was in 2020 when Spaun \u2014 who had been misdiagnosed with Type 2 diabetes some 18 months earlier \u2014 hit his lob wedge to 19 inches to win the challenge.",
      "The charity of his choice: The Junior Diabetes Research Foundation, now known as Breakthrough T1D.",
      "\u201cWhen Travelers got word of where I wanted that donation to go, Andy Bessette kind of broke down apparently and was touched very deeply because he's a very integral part of that charity and donates quite a lot of money, too,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cSo that initiated our connection.\u201d",
      "Bessette's son, Chris, was was diagnosed with Type 1 in 2011 at age 18. They are deeply connected with Breakthrough T1D, and when he heard where Spaun directed his donation, the Bessette family immediately matched it.",
      "So began a relationship that became more valuable than Spaun could have imagined.",
      "Even after the initial diagnosis of Type 2 in the fall of 2018, Spaun kept losing weight and energy. Something wasn't right and he knew it.",
      "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin. Type 2 is more common, mainly affect adults. The body doesn't make enough insulin and is often managed with lifestyle changes, such as diet.",
      "Once doctors got the diagnosis right in 2021, Spaun still struggled to find the right treatment for someone who spends five hours or more on the golf course. On one occasion, his close friend Harold Varner III noticed something off and encouraged to tap into Bessette's resources.",
      "\u201cWe called him together, Harold and I, and I said, \u2018J.J., anything you need, you tell me.\u2019 He told me what was going on. It was about getting the right kind of care,\" Bessette said.",
      "In this case, it was a new product that allowed insulin to be inhaled instead of injections, far easier to manage on the course. Bessette also connected him with a doctor in Los Angeles who worked with athletes on how to handle blood sugar levels.",
      "\u201cHe is very well connected with the diabetes community, so all these doctors were at my disposal,\u201d Spaun said.",
      "A tough road is nothing new to Spaun. He was a walk-on at San Diego State. He spent three years on developmental circuits before reaching the PGA Tour. He had to go back to the Korn Ferry Tour, fell as low as No. 584 in the world ranking in 2021 and won for the first time a year later at the Texas Open.",
      "Spaun has dips in form, as most golfers do. He was worried a year ago about losing his card until he pulled it together late last year. He was getting closer, losing in a playoff at The Players Championship to Rory McIlroy, before his epic breakthrough at Oakmont.",
      "It resonated in some corners more than others.",
      "\u201cIt was awesome to see him have the week he had,\u201d said Eric Cole, who also has Type 1 diabetes and has risen from the mini-tours to play in six of the last seven majors. \u201cIt's cool to see diabetes doesn't slow him down. He has a lot of extra stuff to deal with behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "Imagine the thrill for Bessette when he watched Spaun overcome a misdiagnosis and manage Type 1 diabetes to handle the highest pressure in the game. Bessette can relate. He qualified as a hammer thrower for the 1980 Olympics that the U.S. boycotted.",
      "\u201cI think this is one of the most amazing achievements in sport for somebody who has Type 1, whose sugar levels are up and down, trying to keep them under control and win the U.S. Open,\u201d Bessette said. \u201cAre you kidding me? It's brutal competition for four days. I told him, \u2018I\u2019m amazed by what you did.'\"",
      "Spaun returned to the Travelers Championship this year with an empty tank. He said blood sugar levels crashed hard after he won at Oakmont, from the battle on the back nine but more from the emotion and celebration and all the media obligations that followed.",
      "Five years after he hit an 85-yard shot onto a red umbrella, he returned with a big silver trophy as the U.S. Open champion. Bessette was beaming, and the connection wasn't lost on Spaun.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s kind of been there for me the whole way,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cEven when I got my diagnosis corrected, I guess, it was even more so helpful to have JDRF and Andy on my side to kind of help me navigate another new territory.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Indiana Pacers fans arrived at Gainbridge Fieldhouse ready to celebrate their first NBA title",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The gasp inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse was followed quickly by a hush Sunday night.",
      "Just seven minutes into Game 7 of the NBA Finals, the Indiana Pacers' roaring fans went silent, struggling to fathom what they were watching \u2014 a replay of two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton hurting his lower right leg and the anguished look on the face of his father, John.",
      "They didn't wait to hear the diagnosis; they already figured they had it.",
      "\u201cI saw (his Achilles tendon) pop immediately, you could see it kind of explode,\u201d said 37-year-old Nick Poore, a lifelong fan of his hometown team. \u201cTough. I mean it is what it is, life goes on. What else can you do besides take it on the chin, you know?\u201d",
      "Coach Rick Carlisle didn't confirm it was a torn Achilles tendon either during his postgame comments though he noted the team's hearts dropped just like so many inside their home arena.",
      "Of course, Haliburton's teammates tried valiantly to rally without their leader but struggled late in the third quarter and early in the fourth of a 103-91 loss at Oklahoma City, a loss that extended Indiana's title drought to 49 years and left many wondering what's next?",
      "This one may have been the most gut-wrenching of all.",
      "A strained right calf had limited Haliburton to 23 minutes Thursday night, but he scored 14 points and had five assists to help Indiana force Sunday's decisive game. With two more days of rest, Haliburton said he felt better and he was early with three 3-pointers and nine points, his best start in the series.",
      "\u201cTyrese was about to cook, he was going to go off,\u201d Poore said. \u201cThat was tough because you could tell he was bringing it tonight.\u201d",
      "But one wrong step ended Haliburton's night and dashed the hopes of so many Pacers fans who came to celebrate the title they'd longed for.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not what we wanted to see but you know what he\u2019s going to want. He\u2019s going to want this team to continue to fight,\u201d Chris Denari, the Pacers\u2019 television play-by-play announcer told the stunned crowd. \u201cHe is the leader of this team. We know what he\u2019s meant since he arrived from Sacramento and he\u2019s going to need all of our thoughts and prayers, but he's going to want this team to fight and win an NBA title.\u201d",
      "The crowd responded to Denari's plea, cheering raucously for each Pacers basket, defensive stop, Thunder foul or turnover. But the late runs eventually took their toll, quieting fans and sending some home for good after Oklahoma City built a 21-point lead.",
      "Worse, it's yet another potentially cruel chapter in the franchise\u2019s long and painful history.",
      "Since the three-time ABA champion team joined the NBA, it has endured every seemingly imaginable and unimaginable setback: the 1977 telethon that saved the team, the Malice in the Palace that cost Reggie Miller his last title shot, near-misses against LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference finals and Boston's sweep in the conference finals last year with the injured Haliburton watching the last two games from the bench.",
      "There\u2019s also the injury history. Since Miller's retirement, Danny Granger, Paul George and Victor Oladipo all appeared poised to be the Pacers next big thing \u2014 only to have their careers derailed by injuries. Now it's Haliburton trying to break the jinx.",
      "\u201cHeartbreaking,\u201d said Vernon Morgan, who has followed the Pacers since George McGinnis played for the ABA team in the early 1970s. \u201cWe're still waiting to see if this (injury) will be a detriment to his career or if he's going to recover from it. I realize he'll be out probably all of next year, but we've been counted out before.\"",
      "How tough has this been on Pacers fans?",
      "Anthony Brehob, age 27, came dressed in a Roy Hibbert jersey and had big expectations and like many who stood in the snaking lines on the city's streets.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m expecting a close game, and I\u2019m really hoping Haliburton pulls it off at the end,\" Brehob said. \"If they lose, it\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201d",
      "The problem now is it's also going to be a long offseason with many questions surrounding Haliburton and what can be expected when he does return.",
      "Carlisle said he expects Haliburton, who was on crutches Sunday night, to make a full recovery. And in a state that loves underdogs so much it's produced both the real-life and Hollywood version of \u201cHoosiers,\" the reality is the future still looks bright.",
      "And that at least is some solace to these fans.",
      "\u201cIt's enough to celebrate,\u201d Morgan said of Indiana's playoff run. \u201cWe pushed them to Game 7 and it's a young team. They'll be back. We've been counted out before, nobody counted on us to make a good story. We'll be back again next year.\u201d",

      "Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to pitch Sunday in his second start since resuming his two-way career, and the Los Angeles Dodgers will be closely watching the progress of their superstar",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to pitch Sunday in his second start since resuming his two-way career, and the Los Angeles Dodgers will be closely watching the progress of their superstar.",
      "Ohtani will start on the mound and bat leadoff against the Washington Nationals at Chavez Ravine. The Dodgers are heading into Ohtani\u2019s second start unsure whether he will throw one or two innings, but manager Dave Roberts expects to see another step in the three-time MVP's lengthy road back to the mound.",
      "\u201cToday, I think there will be a lot more normalcy,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cExcited to see him throw the baseball. Expect him to be a lot more efficient, better pitch-making, but we'll see.\u201d",
      "Ohtani yielded two hits and a run while throwing 28 pitches in the first inning Monday against San Diego in his first mound outing since 2023. Ohtani's movement on his breaking pitches was sharp, and his fastball hit 100 mph, but his command was \u201cjust OK,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Roberts said there's no firm timeline for Ohtani to extend his starts to full length. The Dodgers also have made no long-term decisions about how they will handle the day-to-day details of the dual pursuits of baseball\u2019s only serious two-way player in several decades.",
      "Roberts acknowledged that Ohtani could move out of his customary leadoff spot in the Dodgers\u2019 lineup on the days when he pitches, particularly at home. While Ohtani has told Roberts he isn't bothered by pitching the first inning and then going straight to the on-deck circle to be the Dodgers\u2019 first batter in the bottom half, Roberts recognizes it\u2019s not ideal.",
      "\u201cHe's said that he's completely fine with hitting leadoff (and) doesn't want to change,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSo I think that for now, we'll stay status quo, but coming out of this one, you could say maybe it might make more sense to hit second or third or fourth.\u201d",
      "Ohtani went just 4 for 23 with 11 strikeouts at the plate in the Dodgers\u2019 last six games, and that includes his two-hit performance last Monday during his mound return. He has homered in just one of his past 18 games, although he still entered Sunday tied for third in the majors with 25 homers.",
      "The Dodgers will be patient with Ohtani as he readjusts to two-way life while managing the demands of both jobs.",
      "\u201cI have not seen signs of fatigue,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI think that like all hitters, when you start chasing outside the strike zone, it's hard to have consistent success. I don't think that's a fatigue thing, but we'll manage it, and I think that I can only take him at his word, and the swing speed and stuff you track is still in line. Again, once we ramp up more, it might be a different conversation.\u201d",
      "Ohtani didn't pitch at all last season while recovering from arm surgery during his first season with the Dodgers under a 10-year, $700 million contract. He won his third MVP award while becoming the first player in baseball history with 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season, and the Dodgers won his first World Series championship.",
      "Ohtani entered Sunday third in the majors with a .996 OPS, but some of his other offensive numbers have gone down slightly this season while he returned to a steady throwing program.",
      "The Dodgers have no public concerns about Ohtani's production, remaining supportive of his two-way play \u2014 and they need his arm, given their season-long injury woes on the mound.",

      "Waymo\u2019s robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service that began earlier this year in Austin",
      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",
      "With 18 different robotaxi partnerships in place around the world, Uber says it is on pace to make about 1.5 million annual driverless trips that either transport passengers or deliver food.",

      "Officials for ispace announced the news from Tokyo on Tuesday. The crash landing was the second for ispace in two years.",
      "This time, the company\u2019s lander named Resilience was aiming for the moon\u2019s far north in Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold. NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed pictures of the crash site last week where Resilience and its mini rover ended up as wreckage.",
      "Company officials blamed the accident on the lander's laser range finder, saying it was slow to kick in and properly measure the spacecraft's distance to the lunar surface. Resilience was descending at a rapid rate of 138 feet (42 meters) per second when contact was lost, and crashed five seconds later, they said.",
      "Bad software caused ispace's first lunar lander to slam into the moon in 2023. Like the latest try, the problem occurred during the final phase of descent.",
      "Of seven moon landing attempts by private outfits in recent years, only one can claim total success: Firefly Aerospace's touchdown of its Blue Ghost lander in March. Blue Ghost launched with Resilience in January, sharing a SpaceX rocket ride from Florida.",
      "Aside from Texas-based Firefly, only five countries have pulled off a successful lunar landing: the Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan. And only the U.S. has put astronauts on the moon, back during NASA's Apollo program more than a half-century ago.",
      "Despite back-to-back losses, ispace is pressing ahead with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, with NASA cooperation, as well as a fourth planned mission. Extra tests and improvements will add as much as 1.5 billion yen (more than $10 million) to the development costs, officials said.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada stressed that his company \u201chas not stepped down in the face of setbacks\" and is looking to regain customers' trust. Outside experts will join the accident review, and ispace will collaborate more closely with the Japanese Space Agency on technical matters.",

    "story": [
      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\" on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents. His father was granted a foreign worker's visa, and his wife and children obtained related dependent visas.",
      "Federal authorities said Chetal could face deportation as a result of the criminal case.",
      "Authorities say Chetal's father lost his job at Morgan Stanley because of the kidnapping and his son's connection to it.",
      "Chetal was initially released from federal custody on his own recognizance. But a judge ordered him detained until trial earlier this year after federal prosecutors said they discovered Chetal was involved in another crypto theft worth $2 million in October that he didn't tell them about, after he had begun cooperating with federal authorities.",

      "Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving cybercriminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers at cybersecurity outlet Cybernews say that billions of login credentials have been leaked and compiled into datasets online, giving criminals \u201cunprecedented access\u201d to accounts consumers use each day.",
      "According to a report published this week, Cybernews researchers have recently discovered 30 exposed datasets that each contain a vast amount of login information \u2014 amounting to a total of 16 billion compromised credentials. That includes user passwords for a range of popular platforms including Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Sixteen billion is roughly double the amount of people on Earth today, signaling that impacted consumers may have had credentials for more than one account leaked. Cybernews notes that there are most certainly duplicates in the data and so \u201cit's impossible to tell how many people or accounts were actually exposed.\u201d",
      "It's also important to note that the leaked login information doesn't span from a single source, such as one breach targeting a company. Instead, it appears that the data was stolen through multiple events over time, and then compiled and briefly exposed publicly, which is when Cybernews reports that its researchers discovered it.",
      "Various infostealers are most likely the culprit, Cybernews noted. Infostealers are a form of malicious software that breaches a victim's device or systems to take sensitive information.",
      "Many questions remain about these leaked credentials, including whose hands the login credentials are in now. But, as data breaches become more and more common in today's world, experts continue to stress the importance of maintaining key \u201ccyber hygiene.\u201d",
      "If you're worried about your account data potentially being exposed in a recent breach, the first thing you can do is change your password \u2014 and avoid using the same or similar login credentials on multiple sites. If you find it too hard to memorize all your different passwords, consider a password manager or passkey. And also add multifactor authentication, which can serve as a second layer of verification through your phone, email or USB authenticator key.",

      "Civilians are left unaware of when and where Israel will strike next, despite Israeli forces issuing warnings through their Persian-language online channels. When the missiles land, disconnected phone and web services mean not knowing for hours or days if their family or friends are among the victims. That\u2019s left many scrambling on various social media apps to see what\u2019s happening \u2014 again, only a glimpse of life able to reach the internet in a nation of over 80 million people.",
      "Activists see it as a form of psychological warfare for a nation all-too familiar with state information controls and targeted internet shutdowns during protests and unrest.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime controls the information sphere really, really tightly,\u201d Marwa Fatafta, the Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe know why the Iranian regime shuts down. It wants to control information. So their goal is quite clear.\u201d",
      "But this time, it\u2019s happening during a deadly conflict that erupted on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 657 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,000 wounded, according to a Washington-based group called Human Rights Activists.",
      "Iran has retaliated by firing 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli military estimates. Most have been shot down by Israel\u2019s multitiered air defenses, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds others wounded. Guidance from Israeli authorities, as well as round-the-clock news broadcasts, flows freely and consistently to Israeli citizens, creating in the last seven days an uneven picture of the death and destruction brought by the war.",

The group said a handful of users have been able to maintain connectivity through virtual private networks.",
      "Those lucky few have become lifelines for Iranians left in the dark. In recent days, those who have gained access to mobile internet for a limited time describe using that fleeting opportunity to make calls on behalf of others, checking in on elderly parents and grandparents, and locating those who have fled Tehran.",
      "The only access to information Iranians do have is limited to websites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run television and radio stations offer irregular updates on what\u2019s happening inside the country, instead focusing their time on the damage wrought by their strikes on Israel.",
      "The lack of information going in or out of Iran is stunning, considering that the advancement of technology in recent decades has only brought far-flung conflicts in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere directly to a person's phone anywhere in the world.",
      "That direct line has been seen by experts as a powerful tool to shift public opinion about any ongoing conflict and potentially force the international community to take a side. It has also turned into real action from world leaders under public and online pressure to act or use their power to bring an end to the fighting.",
      "But Mehdi Yahyanejad, a key figure in promoting internet freedom in Iran, said that the Islamic Republic is seeking to \u201cpurport an image\u201d of strength, one that depicts only the narrative that Israel is being destroyed by sophisticated Iranian weapons that include ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.",
      "\u201cI think most likely they\u2019re just afraid of the internet getting used to cause mass unrest in the next phase of whatever is happening,\u201d Yahayanejad said. \u201cI mean, some of it could be, of course, planned by the Israelis through their agents on the ground, and some of this could be just a spontaneous unrest by the population once they figure out that the Iranian government is badly weakened.",

      "U.K. lawmakers have backed a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law",
      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers on Friday approved a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law.",
      "Members of Parliament voted 314-291 to back the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill following an impassioned and respectful debate. The majority of 23 was less than the 55 when they last voted on the issue in November, meaning that some lawmakers changed their minds in the intervening months.",
      "Since November, the bill has been scrutinized, leading to some changes in the proposed legislation, which has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
      "\u201cI appreciate it's a huge moment for the country.\u201d she told Sky News after the vote. \u201cIt was a huge sense of relief because this is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "It's not quite law yet as the bill now goes to the unelected House of Lords, which can amend or delay policy, though it can\u2019t overrule the lower chamber.",
      "The vote is potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was partially legalized in 1967.",
      "The bill would allow terminally ill adults over age 18 in England and Wales, who are deemed to have less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This particular bill doesn\u2019t apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland, the latter of which is holding its own vote on the issue.",
      "Perhaps the most important change to the bill from last November was the dropping of the requirement that a judge sign off on any decision. Many in the legal profession had objected.",
      "Now any request would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.",
      "Changes were also made to ensure the establishment of independent advocates to support people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health conditions and the creation of a disability advisory board.",
      "Having received the go-ahead from doctors and the panel, the terminally ill person would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Another big change made was that \u201cno person,\u201d including doctors, social care workers and pharmacists, will be obliged to take part.",
      "For months, the bill has divided lawmakers, political parties, as well as the country.",
      "Proponents of the bill argued that those with a terminal diagnosis must be given a choice at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering. They also said that the current situation discriminates against the poor as wealthy individuals can already travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones die.",
      "However, opponents warned that the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled and older people, could be at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, into ending their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members.",
      "Supporters of both sides all agreed of the need to make improvements in palliative care and greater investments in hospices to ease suffering.",
      "Passions were running high outside of Parliament where hundreds of people gathered to make their voices heard.",
      "Supporters were dressed in clothing emblazoned with the phrase \u201cCampaign for Dignity in Dying,\u201d while opponents held up banners urging lawmakers not to make the state-run National Health Service the \u201cNational Suicide Service.\u201d",
      "The legislation now goes to the unelected House of Lords, Any amendments would then go back to the House of Commons.",
      "Backers of the bill say implementation will take four years, rather than the initially suggested two. That means it could become law in 2029, around the time that the next general election must be held.",
      "There is clearly no consensus in the Cabinet about the measure.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the bill on Friday, while his health secretary, Wes Streeting, voted against.",
      "The government has said it will respect the outcome.",
      "However, it's not clear what the cost implications are, or how it would impact the NHS, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "Summer gets its official start in the Northern Hemisphere with the arrival of the summer solstice",
      "Peak sunshine has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 the summer solstice.",
      "Friday is the longest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical summer. It's the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the shortest day of the year and winter will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun's annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun's paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2013 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1.",

      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don\u2019t return as expected",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cHave you seen the cats?\u201d",
      "That's a common refrain in my household because our two felines, Maple and Juniper, can venture outside through a flap in the backdoor. Like many other London house cats, they're free to come and go, roaming the surrounding backyards and beyond, equipped with microchips to identify them if they get lost.",
      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don't return as expected.",
      "If you're worried about your furry friend's whereabouts, technology can help you keep tabs on them.",
      "Dedicated pet trackers are collar-worn devices that typically use GPS signals to pinpoint the location of the animal wearing them. They use a 4G cellphone signal or your home Wi-Fi connection to relay the position to a smartphone app.",
      "There are many products on the market. Tractive, Jiobit and Pawfit are among brands that offer trackers for both dogs and cats. Devices for the latter are generally smaller and lighter.",
      "Dog trackers with integrated collars are available from Fi and Whistle. PetTracer is a cat collar that uses both GPS and radio signals from a home base station. FitBark, also for dogs, has an Apple Watch app to monitor location and other activity.",
      "Garmin has a range of GPS dog collars that work with handheld devices resembling walkie-talkies, but they're pricey and aimed at outdoors enthusiasts like hunters.",
      "Most trackers let you designate a safe zone on a map, usually your house and surrounding area, and alert you if your pet has left it.",
      "They usually operate on the 4G LTE spectrum commonly used by wireless carriers. It typically has the longest range of any cellular signal, said Andrew Bleiman, Tractive's executive vice president for North America.",
      "That means strong connectivity in most of Europe and North America \u201cunless you\u2019re in a really far flung place like the middle of a national park,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "Exact price depends on brand and model. Most devices sell for less than $100. However, keep in mind you'll also have to pay a subscription fee for the cell service to function.",
      "While that could cost $100 or more a year, for some pet owners it's worth the \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "The collars usually have a built-in rechargeable battery but battery life varies. Most will be last at least two to three days before they need charging, and a lot longer in ideal conditions.",
      "One big factor is signal strength. The battery will drain faster if the device has to work harder to pick up the GPS or connect to Wi-Fi. Some save power by not sending coordinates in the safe zone.",
      "Like fitness watches for humans, pet tracking apps offer health and activity monitoring features. You can see how long your cat or dog has spent resting or exercising on a daily or hourly basis.",
      "But be aware, a tracker is \u201cnot going to keep your pet in the backyard,\" Bleiman said. It will only \"alert you when they leave the virtual fence area that you set up.\u201d",
      "This One TechTip was inspired by Maple, who once went AWOL for days. It turned out he was hanging out in a backyard 10 doors down the street. We only found out after the residents got hold of a pet microchip scanner to look up our contact details to let us know so we could retrieve him.",
      "Tractive provided a loaner device to try. Using the included breakaway collar, we put it on Maple, who clearly didn\u2019t like it at first. He dashed out the back door and jumped through a hole in the fence.",
      "Over the next day, I used the Tractive app to monitor his movements. It showed his travels back and forth onto various neighboring properties. He came back to rest for a few hours around midnight, went out to prowl again around 3 a.m, then came back after an hour to nap some more.",
      "It was fascinating to see where he was spending his time. According to the app's \u201cheatmap,\" one of Maple's favorite spots was the same backyard where we had to retrieve him previously.",
      "About 24 hours after I attached the Tractive collar on Maple, I noticed he was no longer wearing it. It had somehow come off.",
      "If you can't find your pet's exact location, or the device gets lost, Tractive has a \u201cradar\u201d feature to pinpoint it with your phone's Bluetooth. Other brands have similar features.",
      "On the app's map, I could see it was in a nearby backyard and that I was getting closer because the circle was getting bigger. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was and, not wanting to disturb the neighbors, I gave up.",
      "Bleiman recommends using a harness for cats that don't like collars, but I'm not convinced.",
      "It's common for cats and dogs to be implanted with microchips, with the details added to a database. That makes it much easier to reunite owners with lost dogs and cats, even if they've strayed hundreds of miles away or gone missing for years.",
      "Pet microchips, about the size of a grain of rice implanted just below the skin, are legally required in some European countries. There's no federal law in the U.S., though some places like Hawaii now require them, so check with state or local authorities.",
      "But there's some confusion about what microchips can do. Because they don't have a power supply, they can't be tracked in real time. Whoever finds your pet would need to take it to a vet or a shelter to can scan the device for contact details.",
      "Many pet owners use Bluetooth trackers like Apple's Air Tags, Samsung's SmartTags or similar devices from Tile, Cube and Chipolo, which rely on low-power signals relayed by passing smartphones.",
      "Bluetooth trackers have a range of 100 to 500 feet (30 to 150 meters), depending on the model. The batteries last for months if not longer, and there's no need to pay for a subscription.",
      "However, they're not specifically marketed for pets. That hasn't stopped pet owners, judging from many recommendations they've posted in online forums.",
      "Chipolo advises that its round plastic trackers are only for \u201cin-house pets like house-trained cats and smaller dogs\u201d and warns against using them on \"larger dog breeds and outdoor cats.\"",
      "Still, they can be a solution for some pet owners.",
      "\u201cBluetooth is a totally reasonable solution if you\u2019re in a downtown urban core,\u201d Bleiman said. \u201cBut pets move fast. And if you\u2019re in a wooded park, or you\u2019re in a suburban area \u2014 let alone a more rural or wilderness area \u2014 it\u2019s pretty unlikely your pet is going to be close to a Bluetooth device.\"",

    "story": [
      "For European drone manufacturers, being able to say that their equipment has been tried in war by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch",
      "LE BOURGET, France -- About once a month, French drone manufacturer Henri Seydoux makes what has become a necessary pilgrimage for many in his business \u2014 he goes to Ukraine.",
      "Because for drone technology, there is no harder place to survive than the frontlines of the war against Russia\u2019s invasion, where both sides are using unmanned aerial machines of all shapes and sizes to kill and to observe, reshaping modern warfare.",
      "And because the battlefields also bristle with electronic countermeasures and weapons to confuse, jam and shoot down drones, Ukraine has also become an extreme real-life proving ground for advances in drone technology, some of which has started to spill over into non-military sectors.",
      "For manufacturers, being able to say that their drones and related equipment have been battle-tried and tested by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch as they market their wares not just to national defense departments, but also to police forces, border authorities, rescue services and civilian users.",
      "\u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is a good machine, it works,\u2019 people can believe us or not. But when it\u2019s guys in Ukraine and others saying they\u2019re happy, it has greater value,\" says Bastien Mancini, president and co-founder of French drone manufacturer Delair, which has teamed up with European defense contractor KNDS to supply Ukrainian forces with 100 exploding drones. KNDS' sales literature notes that they are \u201ccombat-proven.\"",
      "Mancini says civilian users of Delair's other non-military drones \u201csee things that work in Ukraine and say to themselves, \u2018It resists jamming, it resists the loss of a radio connection and whatnot and so it\u2019s going to be fine for civilian use, like inspecting electric cables or whatever.\"",
      "\u201cIt really has helped us win markets. It gives people confidence,\" he told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show, a major shop-window for the aviation and defense industries.",
      "Henri Seydoux, the founder and head of French drone maker Parrot, says Ukraine is \u201cfascinating\u201d from a drone-technology perspective because \u201cit changes so quickly, there are new ideas non-stop.\u201d He's been making regular trips since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to meet Ukrainian drone manufacturers, drone software developers and the military authorities.",
      "\u201cEvery quarter, the situation changes completely,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEvery company, let\u2019s say, that makes military equipment or every army is very interested by drones. But the ones that really use them and understand how to use them is the Ukrainians.\"",
      "For Ukraine, trying to defend against swarms of Russian drones that target cities and waves of drone-supported Russian troops is a matter of survival. So, too, is finding workarounds to counter electronic warfare systems that Russia deploys to jam and disable Ukrainian drones, igniting what has become a drone-technology arms race between the two sides and for manufacturers outside of Ukraine, too.",
      "Small drones that drop bombs and explode against targets \u2014 mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of other more complex weapons systems that its allies have supplied \u2014 have become increasingly vital for Ukraine's resistance. Its Defense Ministry has said that it plans to buy 4.5 million drones this year, all Ukrainian-made, that allow their operators to see what the machines see, so they can guide the flights in real time \u2014 exploding in a Russian trench, for example, or even against a single enemy soldier. That's three times more drones than the ministry bought last year, it says.",
      "\u201cDrones saved Ukraine,\u201d said Alex Vorobei, the Ukrainian sales representative for Ailand Systems, a Ukrainian start-up developing a drone that detects land mines.",
      "Vorobei and others in the drone business say that manufacturers not involved in Ukraine risk being left behind.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the defense field and still not in Ukraine, it means you are nowhere,\" Vorobei said at the Paris show.",
      "A micro surveillance drone unveiled by Parrot at the Paris show has a nod to Ukraine in its name \u2014 the Anafi UKR \u2014 and also has been field-tested in what Seydoux describes as the \u201cvery harsh environment\u201d on the frontline. It\u2019s equipped with artificial intelligence technology to enable it to find its way when radio and navigational signals are jammed.",
      "Parrot says the drone\u2019s ready-for-war resilience and features also make it a good fit for law enforcement operations, such as monitoring crowds, tracking suspects or keeping watch over borders, and for rescue services in remote areas or during fires and accidents when navigational signals might go down.",
      "Ukraine has been \u201ca real laboratory or test for us, to see if our products worked,\u201d said Delair's Mancini. Its Oskar exploding drone, which has polystyrene wings, carries a half-kilogram (one pound) warhead to detonate against troops and lightly armored vehicles.",
      "Delair developed it in under a year, repurposing one of its civilian drones that was already used in France for mapping and inspecting power cables, and hardening it for Ukraine with technology to resist Russian jamming.",
      "\"Five or 10 years ago, lots of people were asking themselves, \u2019Are drones really useful for something?' No one is asking that question today,\" he said.",

      "Amazon is gearing up to make as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo",
      "HAYWARD, Calif. -- Amazon is gearing up to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also vying to join the autonomous race.",
      "The 220,000-square-foot (20,440-square-meters) robotaxi factory announced Wednesday heralds a new phase in Amazon's push into a technological frontier that began taking shape in 2009, when Waymo was launched as a secret project within Google.",
      "Amazon began eyeing the market five years ago when it shelled out $1.2 billion for self-driving startup Zoox, which will be the brand behind a robotaxi service that plans to begin transporting customers in Las Vegas late this year before expanding into San Francisco next year.",
      "Zoox, conceived in 2014, will be trying to catch up to Waymo, which began operating robotaxis in Phoenix nearly five years ago then charging for rides in San Francisco in 2023 before expanding into Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Waymo says it has already more than 10 million paid rides while other would-be rivals such as Amazon and Tesla are still fine-tuning their self-driving technology while tackling other challenges, such how to ramp up their fleet.",
      "Amazon feels like has addressed that issue with Zoox's manufacturing plant that spans across the equivalent of three-and-a-half football fields located in Hayward, California \u2014 about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north of a factory where Tesla makes some of the electric vehicles that Musk believes will eventually be able to operate without a driver behind the wheel.",
      "Since moving into the former bus manufacturing factory in 2023, Zoox has transformed it into a high-tech facility where its boxy, gondola-like vehicles are put together and tested along a 21-station assembly line. For now, Zoox is only making one robotaxi per day, but by next year hopes to be churning them out at the rate of three vehicles per hour.",
      "By 2027, Zoox hopes to making 10,000 robotaxis annually in Hayward for a fleet that it hopes to take into other major markets, including Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Although Zoox will be assembling its robotaxis in the U.S., about half of the parts are imported from outside the country, according to company officials.",
      "\u201cIt's an exciting time to be heading on this journey,\u201d Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said during a Tuesday tour of the robotaxi factory that she co-hosted with Jesse Levinson, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "Although Zoox will be lagging well behind, it believes it can lure passengers with vehicles that look more like carriages that cars with seating for up to four passengers. Waymo, in contrast, builds its self-driving technology on to cars made by other major automakers, making its robotaxi look similar to vehicles steered by humans. Zoox isn't even bothering to put a steering wheel in its robotaxis.",
      "As it continues to test its robotaxis in Las Vegas, Zoox recently struck a partnership to give rides to guests of Reorts World. It's also still testing its robotaxis in San Francisco, where Waymo already has turned driverless cars into an everyday site in a city that has been renowned for cable cars since the 1870s. While testing in San Francisco last month, a minor collision between a Zoox robotaxi and a person riding an electric scooter last month prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall to update its self-driving technology.

      "Tesla is still angling to compete against Waymo too, although it remains unclear when Musk will fuflil his long-running promise to build the world's largest robotaxi service. Musk still hasn't given up on the goal, though his current ambitions are more modest than they were in 2019. when he predicted Tesla would be running a fleet of 1 million robotaxis by now. He is currently aiming for a limited rollout of Tesla robotaxis in Austin this Sunday, although that date could change because Musk is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Zoox, in contrast, is planning to operate 500 to 1,000 of its robotaxis in small to medium-sized markets and about 2,000 robotaxis in major cities where it eventually operates, according to Evans. The company thinks each robotaxi produced in its Hayward plan should be on the road for about five years, or about 500,000 miles",

      "Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra.",
      "This adaptability is a skill that long predates the modern age. According to a new study published Wednesday in Nature, ancient Homo sapiens developed the flexibility to survive by finding food and other resources in a wide variety of difficult habitats before they dispersed from Africa about 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cOur superpower is that we are ecosystem generalists,\u201d said Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.",
      "Our species first evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. While prior fossil finds show some groups made early forays outside the continent, lasting human settlements in other parts of the world didn't happen until a series of migrations around 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat was different about the circumstance of the migrations that succeeded \u2014 why were humans ready this time?\u201d said study co-author Emily Hallett, an archaeologist at Loyola University Chicago.",
      "Earlier theories held that Stone Age humans might have made a single important technological advance or developed a new way of sharing information, but researchers haven\u2019t found evidence to back that up.",
      "This study took a different approach by looking at the trait of flexibility itself.",
      "The scientists assembled a database of archaeological sites showing human presence across Africa from 120,000 to 14,000 years ago. For each site, researchers modeled what the local climate would have been like during the time periods that ancient humans lived there.",
      "\u201cThere was a really sharp change in the range of habitats that humans were using starting around 70,000 years ago,\u201d Hallet said. \u201cWe saw a really clear signal that humans were living in more challenging and more extreme environments.\u201d",
      "While humans had long survived in savanna and forests, they shifted into everything from from dense rainforests to arid deserts in the period leading up to 50,000 years ago, developing what Hallet called an \"ecological flexibility that let them succeed.\u201d",
      "While this leap in abilities is impressive, it\u2019s important not to assume that only Homo sapiens did it, said University of Bordeaux archaeologist William Banks, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Other groups of early human ancestors also left Africa and established long-term settlements elsewhere, including those that evolved into Europe\u2019s Neanderthals, he said.",
      "The new research helps explain why humans were ready to expand across the world way back when, he said, but it doesn\u2019t answer the lasting question of why only our species remains today.",

      "NEW YORK -- An Australian moth follows the stars during its yearly migration, using the night sky as a guiding compass, according to a new study.",
      "When temperatures heat up, nocturnal Bogong moths fly about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to cool down in caves by the Australian Alps. They later return home to breed and die.",
      "Birds routinely navigate by starlight, but the moths are the first known invertebrates, or creatures without a backbone, to find their way across such long distances using the stars.",
      "Scientists have long wondered how the moths travel to a place they've never been. A previous study hinted that Earth's magnetic field might help steer them in the right direction, along with some kind of visual landmark as a guide.",
      "Since stars appear in predictable patterns each night, scientists suspected they might help lead the way. They placed moths in a flight simulator that mimicked the night sky above them and blocked out the Earth's magnetic field, noting where they flew. Then they scrambled the stars and saw how the moths reacted.",
      "When the stars were as they should be, the moths flapped in the right direction. But when the stars were in random places, the moths were disoriented. Their brain cells also got excited in response to specific orientations of the night sky.",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "It \u201cwas a very clean, impressive demonstration that the moths really are using a view of the night sky to guide their movements,\u201d said Kenneth Lohmann, who studies animal navigation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was not involved with the new research.",
      "Researchers don't know what features of the night sky the moths use to find their way. It could be a stripe of light from the Milky Way, a colorful nebula or something else entirely. Whatever it is, the insects seem to rely on that along with Earth's magnetic field to make their journey.",
      "Other animals harness the stars as a guide. Birds take celestial cues as they soar through the skies and dung beetles roll their remains short distances while using the Milky Way to stay on course.",
      "It's an impressive feat for Bogong moths whose brains are smaller than size of a grain of rice to rely on the night sky for their odyssey, said study author David Dreyer with Lund University in Sweden.",
      "\u201cIt's remarkable that an animal with such a tiny brain can actually do this,\u201d Dreyer said.",

The president will then spend a few hours engaged in bilateral meetings, although it is not not yet known which leaders he plans to meet with on the sidelines of the summit.

After the news conference, Trump is set to leave the Netherlands and return to the U.S.",

This has been a signature issue for Trump well before the new Middle East conflict. The president has long complained that the U.S. has been subsidizing the defense of its allies -- and has even gone so far as threatening that he would not come to the defense of nations not fully paying their way, a radical departure from NATO's Article 5, which says an attack on one is an attack on all.",
      "Trump's criticisms go back as far as the 2017 NATO summit, when he accused his European counterparts of failing to pay what he said was their \"fair share.\"",
      "Though Trump's top advisers have signaled confidence that the 5% threshold will be agreed to by a vote at this year's summit, some nations like Spain have other plans. Spain's prime minister announced over the weekend that it forged an agreement that will allow it to remain in NATO without meeting the new defense spending threshold, instead contributing only 2.1% of the nation's GDP.",
      "Trump has a few other aims for the conference, including urging alliance members to revitalize their industrial capacities for critical minerals and weapons and bilateral meetings with world leaders to reaffirm a commitment to allies, a senior administration official said last week in a call previewing the trip.",
      "In the time since Trump last attended a NATO summit, Russia invaded Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has raged on for more than three years and Trump has repeatedly claimed it would not have happened if he were in office. He has also blamed the war on Ukraine's desire to join NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been a featured guest at NATO summits since the war, including the one former President Joe Biden hosted in Washington last year, but it's reported that Zelenskyy's involvement will be limited this year -- including not having a seat at the table.",
      "This is also Trump's first NATO summit of his second term, a reemergence in the alliance that he sharply criticized during his first term. It also comes after many NATO leaders have already returned to the White House for bilateral meetings to discuss key issues and to gain favor with Trump. Under the shadow of the growing conflict in the Middle East, world leaders will be watching closely for how Trump will enact his America First policy in his second term and how that policy will impact American alliances overseas.",

      "The agreement described by Trump involved two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting at about 12 a.m. EDT starting with Iran. That would come \"when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions,\" Trump said in the Truth Social post.",

      "After 24 hours, the war would be officially declared ended, according to Trump.",

      "In the final hours before the ceasefire was set to go into effect, under the terms described by Trump, Israel said Iran had launched a barrage of missiles, killing at least three people.",
      "Earlier, in a post on social media, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi had denied there was a ceasefire agreement. However, he said if Israel halted its strikes by 4 a.m. Tehran time (8:30 p.m. EDT) \"we have no intention to continue our response afterwards.\"",
      "Araghchi said a final decision \"on the cessation of our military operations\" would be made later and he thanked Iranian armed forces who he said \"responded to any attack by the enemy until the very last minute.\"",

      "The war began June 12 when Israel launched a series of strikes against Iran that included dozens of military targets, including the country's nuclear program.

      "\"Remember, there are many targets left,\" Trump added. \"Tonight's was the most difficult of them all, by far, and perhaps the most lethal. But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.\"",
      "Trump issued a similar message in all capital letters on social media: \"ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance was further asked about the possibility of retaliation from Iran during an appearance on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday.",
      "Vance said \"what happens next is up to the Iranians.\"",
      "\"If they're willing to choose the smart path, they're certainly going to find a willing partner in the United States to dismantle that nuclear weapons program,\" Vance said. \"But if they decide they're going to attack our troops, if they decide they're going to continue to try to build a nuclear weapon, then we are going to respond to that with overwhelming force.\"",

      "Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine told reporters on Sunday that before the U.S. strike against Iran on Saturday, the military elevated force protection measures across the region.",
      "While the administration says it is not interested in a wider war with Iran, Trump's strikes against Tehran on Saturday prompted concern about the potential for escalation from Democrats and some Republicans.",
      "This week, some lawmakers may try to advance bipartisan resolutions seeking to limit Trump's war powers and prohibit U.S. forces from unauthorized hostilities with Iran, though those measures face an uphill battle in the GOP-controlled Congress.",

    "story": [
      "Officials and experts have given conflicting statements over the level of damage",
      "Ballistic experts say it's too soon to determine how much damage Iran's nuclear facilities sustained in the weekend attack.",
      "On Saturday night, the United States targeted nuclear sites in Iran believed to be essential to the country's ability to produce nuclear weapons: a uranium enrichment site located in northwestern Iran -- deep inside a mountain in Fordo -- along with another uranium enrichment site in Natanz and the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, used for metallic uranium production.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters during an early morning briefing Sunday that the Iranian nuclear ambitions had been \"obliterated,\" describing the military strike as \"bold and brilliant.\"",
      "President Donald Trump echoed that statement on Sunday night, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, that \"Monumental Damage\" had been done to all of Iran's nuclear sites.",
      "\"Obliteration is an accurate term!\" Trump wrote, adding that the \"biggest damage\" took place far below ground.",
      "But other officials and experts have not gone as far when asked how much damage was done to the three sites.",
      "Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday morning that it will \"take some time\" to assess how much damage has been done.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "There is currently a lack of understanding of the extent of the damage caused by the strikes, an Israeli official told ABC News on Sunday. In addition, it is unclear whether any material was moved from the Fordo site ahead of the strikes, the official said.",
      "The plan was \"well coordinated\" and resulted from months of planning between the U.S. and Israel, the official said.",
      "However, the aim of the overall operation was to degrade -- not destroy -- Iran's nuclear program, a separate Israeli source told ABC News.",
      "\"We did not say we eliminate the nuclear program,\" the source said. \"We said remove the immediate existential threat, which is very different.\"",
      "Other experts expressed skepticism of the damage that was done to Iran's nuclear sites.",
      "A high-level European weapons systems and ballistics expert told ABC News that it seems \"highly unlikely\" that the bombs would be detonated in close vicinity to Fordo's underground structure, based on the calculated performance of the GBU-57, or the \"bunker buster\" bomb.",
      "Calculations show that the GBU-57 cannot penetrate more than 65 feet through underground rock, but the Fordo enrichment site was built up to nearly 300 feet beneath the ground, within solid rock, the expert said.",
      "\"I personally can\u2019t imagine that a lot of damage was done,\" especially if the underground facility was properly designed, the ballistics expert said.",
      "The U.S. could have dropped several bombs to make the rock more fragile, allowing a subsequent strike to do more damage, the expert said.",
      "The assessment of the degree of damage underground in Fordo is unclear, International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday.",
      "\"Nobody else could be able to tell you how much it has been damaged,\" Grossi said.",
      "The extent of the damage done to the above-ground facility in Natanz is very clear, Grossi said, adding that even the underground centrifuge -- used to enrich the uranium to higher grades -- suffered extensively due to the combined impacts that damaged the external power supply. Significant damage was also done at Isfahan, which has been sustaining attacks for several days, Grossi said.",
      "The true extent of damage to the three sites -- including their nuclear infrastructure and what remains -- cannot be ascertained until inspectors from the IAEA or members of the international community are allowed to access them, Aditi Verma, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences, told ABC News.",
      "It generally takes experts some\u00a0time to complete assessments of damage from military action, so the full extent of the degradation to Iran's nuclear facilities will likely remain unknown for some time, John Erath, senior policy director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told ABC News.",
      "The environmental impacts from the strikes -- both chemical and radiological -- are likely to be confined to the immediate area, Verma said.",
      "So far, there are no elevated levels of radioactivity being reported, Emily A. Caffrey, director for the Health Physics Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told ABC News.",
      "\"That is not surprising considering the nature of the material that was presumed present at the site,\" Kathryn Ann Higley, distinguished professor of nuclear science and engineering at Oregon State University and president of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, told ABC News.",
      "Uranium, even enriched uranium, is only slightly radioactive, Higley said. But the absence of radiological signature shouldn\u2019t be taken as an indication of failure or success of the military action, Higley added.",
      "But one \"significant\" concern is that the attacks will permanently estrange Iran from the international system of legal frameworks and norms that have prevented the Iranian government from building a weapon, Verma said.",
      "\"As we know, Iran has a history of developing clandestine enrichment facilities,\" Verma said.",
      "Leaders from all sides should use the intervening time to look for a diplomatic solution that would make further military action unnecessary, Erath said.",

      "Their chances of becoming the next mayor of New York City may have dimmed",
      "NEW YORK -- Their chances of becoming the next mayor of New York City may have dimmed. Their mission now? Stopping former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from getting to City Hall.",
      "In the final day of campaigning before the city's Democratic primary, candidates who are seen as longer shots to win the nomination urged voters to leave Cuomo off their ballots in the city's ranked choice election in a last-ditch effort to block the former governor's comeback from a sexual harassment scandal.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s make sure Andrew Cuomo gets nowhere near City Hall,\u201d candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said Monday on WNYC radio, which interviewed the major candidates ahead of the election.",
      "State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, another candidate, similarly asked voters not to vote for Cuomo, telling the station, \u201cWe need fresh leadership, we need to turn the page and we need bold solutions at this moment.\u201d",
      "The pitches came as Cuomo, who has been considered the frontrunner for months, has been trying to fend off a charge from Zohran Mamdani ahead of Tuesday's election.",
      "Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, would be the city's first Muslim and first Indian American mayor if elected. A democratic socialist who got elected to the Legislature in 2020, Mamdani started the campaign as a relative unknown but has won support with a energetic campaign centered on improving the cost of living.",
      "He spent part the second-to-last day of the campaign visiting businesses and potential voters in northern Manhattan, followed by a crowd of supporters and a man banging a drum.",
      "\"This is the most expensive city in the United States of America and New Yorkers are tired of having to worry each and every hour of each and every day of whether they can afford to live here,\u201d said Mamdani.",
      "Cuomo spoke at a union hall, where he warned Democrats against both radicalism and picking a candidate without experience.",
      "\u201cThis is not a job for a novice. This is not a job for a person who never really had a job before,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe need someone who knows what they are doing on day one, because your lives depend on it.\u201d",
      "Mamdani, meanwhile, exuded confidence, telling WNYC he is \u201cone day from toppling a political dynasty.\u201d",
      "Mamdani and Cuomo represent the Democratic Party\u2019s ideological divides, with Cuomo as an older moderate and Mamdani a younger progressive.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton endorsed Cuomo on Sunday, saying voters should not \u201cunderestimate the complexity\u201d of the challenges faced by a mayor. The New York Times didn\u2019t issue an endorsement this year, but wrote an editorial praising Lander and saying Cuomo would be a better choice than Mamdani, who it said was unworthy of being on people\u2019s ballots.",
      "Mamdani has been endorsed by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.",
      "The two candidates' reactions to the American bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites on Sunday offered more evidence of the party\u2019s internal split.",
      "Cuomo, in a statement, criticized \u201cthe way Trump went about this without consulting Congress, without consulting the normal congressional officials\u201d but stressed that \u201cIran cannot have nuclear capability.\u201d",
      "Mamdani released a statement that slammed Trump but quickly shifted focus back to his key issues, saying \u201cthese actions are the result of a political establishment that would rather spend trillions of dollars on weapons than lift millions out of poverty, launch endless wars while silencing calls for peace, and fearmonger about outsiders while billionaires hollow out our democracy from within.\u201d",
      "Cuomo, who won three terms as governor, resigned in 2021 after a report from the state attorney general concluded that he sexually harassed 11 women. He has denied wrongdoing.",
      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that allows voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters, that person wins the race outright. If nobody hits that threshold, the votes are then tabulated in multiple rounds. After each round, the candidate in last place is eliminated. Votes cast for that person are then redistributed to the candidates ranked next on the voter's ballot.",
      "That continues until one candidate gets a majority.",
      "Cuomo's opponents have urged voters not to rank him at all and therefore deprive him of support in later rounds of counting.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn\u2019t one of them. He\u2019s a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",

    "summary": "Mahmoud Khalil reflected on getting detained by ICE and vowed to keep fighting for Palestinian human rights in a interview with ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis.",
    "story": [
      "Khalil spoke out in his first broadcast interview with ABC News' Linsey Davis",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist who was detained by ICE for more than three months, spoke with ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis in the first on-camera interview since his release.",
      "In the interview, which is set to air on Monday at 7 p.m. ET, Khalil reflected on his detention and pushed back against the Trump administration's claim that he is a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "Khalil, who was detained on March 8, described that day as \"the most difficult day that I've ever lived.\"",
      "Watch more of Linsey Davis' broadcast interview with Mahmoud Khalil on \"Good Morning America\" Monday at 7 a.m. ET and ABC News Live Prime at 7 p.m. ET.",
      "\"I felt like I was literally kidnapped, all the 'know your rights' that I've indulged myself into felt like nothing because at that moment ICE made it clear that you have no rights, whatsoever,\" he told Davis.",
      "Khalil, a green card holder who is married to Dr. Noor Abdalla, an American citizen, was a graduate student at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs where he took part in a series of pro-Palestinian protests on campus against the Israeli military campaign in Gaza.",
      "Abdalla gave birth on April 21 to the couple's first child, a son named Deen, but Khalil's request to be present for his son's birth was denied. He did not meet him until May 22 while in custody.",
      "\"What did that mean that you were denied that?\" Davis asked.",
      "\"That's the most cruel thing that any administration would do,\" Khalil said. \"Clearly, I was not danger to the community, that they could have afforded me that opportunity to be with my son, but it's not only about me, it's about the thousands of people who cannot be with their children.\"",
      "Asked what his first night with his son was like, Khalil said that he \"couldn't sleep.\"",
      "\"[I was] just looking at him, being with him,\" he said. \"I would be alert to any sort of expression that Deen would make because the moment that was stripped of me, of witnessing his birth, really impacted me on so many levels.\"",
      "Khalil was detained in March, with the Trump administration saying then in part that his continued presence in the country would pose a risk to U.S. foreign policy. However, Judge Farbiarz issued a preliminary injunction last week barring the Trump administration from continuing to detain him based on that assertion.",
      "He was detained for an additional week until his release on Friday after the government argued for his continued detention based on their allegation that he misrepresented information on his green card application, an allegation that Khalil and his attorneys deny.",
      "\"The White House has said that you distributed pro-Hamas fliers. Secretary Rubio said that you created an environment of harassment toward Jewish students. President Trump said we got to get him the hell out of our country. Why do you think that you are perceived as such a threat?\" Davis asked Khalil.",
      "\"Because I represent a movement that goes against what this administration is trying to do,\" Khalil responded. \"They try to portray me as a violent person. They try to portray me as a terrorist, as some lunatic, but not presenting any evidence, not presenting any shred of credibility to their claims.\"",
      "Khalil was released Friday evening from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Jena, Louisiana, after U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz issued an order granting his release on bail. The judge said the government made no attempt to prove that Khalil's release would irreparably harm them in some way or that Khalil represented a flight risk.",
      "\"What all that evidence adds up to is a lack of violence, a lack of property destruction, a lack of anything that might be characterized as incitement to violence,\" Farbiarz said of Khalil.",
      "The judge said that the conditions of Khalil's release shall not include electronic monitoring or a requirement that a bond be immediately posted.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the judge's decision to release Khalil, claiming in a statement on Friday that the ruling is \"yet another example of how out-of-control members of the judicial branch are undermining national security,\" and arguing \"an immigration judge, not a district judge, has the authority to decide if Mr. Khalil should be released or detained.\"",
      "\"Their conduct not only denies the result of the 2024 election, it also does great harm to our constitutional system by undermining public confidence in the courts,\" the statement continued.",
      "The ruling to release Khalil came at the same time an immigration judge in Jena, Louisiana, denied Khalil's request for asylum and ordered him to remain detained. Farbiarz's order superseded that ruling.",
      "Khalil, a grandson of Palestinian refugees who was born in Syria and has Algerian citizenship, said that he is facing \"a very long fight ahead,\" but said that he will not stop advocating for Palestinian human rights.",
      "\"I can be detained next week if the government prevails on appeal, which they will not,\" he said. \"But what I will focus on is continuing to advocate for Palestinians.\"",
      "\"The threat of detention will not deter you?\" Davis asked.",
      "\"Not any threat would deter me because no one should stay silent when people are getting killed. No one,\" Khalil said.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel, where at least 1,200 were killed and 251 were taken hostage. There are 50 hostages that remain in Hamas captivity, with 27 that Israel believes are dead, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The war has taken a severe toll on the Palestinian population in Gaza, with 55,104 people killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "When talking about the Palestinian movement, Khalil said there is \"no place\" for antisemitism or \"any form of racism.\"",
      "\"There's no place for any form of racism, including anti-Blackness, antisemitism in the Palestine movement, and the Jewish students and people in general in the United States are an integral part of the Palestinian movement,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Iranian cyberattacks are among the dangers facing the U.S., officials say.",
      "In the wake of President Donald Trump's \"massive precision strikes\" on Iran, concerns have been raised both for Americans in the region and at home.",
      "A principal area of worry is cyberattacks by Iranian state actors, including targeting the banking system or energy grid.",
      "A recent Department of Homeland Security bulletin warned: \"Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors will probably prioritize retaliatory attacks against Israeli targets in the short term but may target U.S. networks due to their perception of U.S. support for Israeli strikes.\"",
      "The bulletin urged domestic critical infrastructure entities to \"immediately\" assess and shore up their security. Such attacks have already infiltrated U.S. water and wastewater systems, according to the non-profit think tank Center for Internet Security, which briefed law enforcement on Friday.",
      "The Center was also concerned that Iran, in the wake of Israeli military strikes, might use \"crude or escalatory tactics\" or informal networks if its capabilities were degraded.",
      "\"The likelihood of such attacks will increase if the U.S. strikes Iran or overtly provides military support to the Israeli air campaign,\" the group said.",
      "And the Center assessed that Iran's considerable network of proxy groups might be able to strike U.S. interests in the Middle East, though their capacity to strike the U.S. homeland was more limited.",
      "The groups, they assessed, while less sophisticated, could still disrupt public infrastructure and the private sector.",
      "On top of that was the fear of attacks by foreign nationals or American citizens inspired to strike the U.S.",
      "In 2018, the National Counterterrorism Center issued a report saying Iran-sponsored or Shia-inspired -- referring to one of the two major branches of Islam which is dominant in Iran -- terror on the U.S. homeland is unlikely, except if the U.S. were to attack Iran.",
      "\"Given sustained bilateral U.S.-Iran tensions, the occurrence of such a catalyst could prompt Shia HVE [homegrown violent extremist] activity relatively quickly, underscoring the benefits of early engagement with Shia communities about indicators of HVE radicalization. Potential triggering events for such Shia HVE violence include U.S. military action against Iran.\"",
      "Iranian forces themselves have previously targeted American interests, hitting U.S. bases in the Middle East, for instance, after top Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani was killed in an American airstrike in Iraq in 2020.",
      "Iranian nationals have also carried out major cyberattacks.",
      "An Iranian national pleaded guilty last month to helping orchestrate the 2019 Baltimore, Maryland, ransomware attack that caused tens of millions of dollars in damage and disrupted critical city services. While prosecutors did not allege Sina Gholinejad was directed in his activities by the Iranian government, in announcing the case they warned more broadly of Iranian government-backed hacking groups targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.",
      "And in the summer of last year, the Justice Department also separately charged a Pakistani man with ties to the Iranian government for allegedly seeking to carry out political assassinations. Authorities told ABC News that among Asif Merchant's targets were Trump and other current and former U.S. officials.",

    "story": [
      "Experts weigh in on damage to Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz.",
      "In the wake of Midnight Hammer, the U.S. operation to bomb Iran's three main nuclear sites, some of the first looks at damage to the locations are coming from satellite imagery of the secretive sites.",
      "President Donald Trump said the three Iranian nuclear facilities hit by the U.S. on Saturday -- Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz -- were \"completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "But others in the administration have been more circumspect, saying a full battlefield damage assessment needs to be made first.",
      "\"I know that battle damage is of great interest. Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine told ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"I think BDA is still pending and way too early to comment on what may or may not be there.\"",
      "Several experts and officials have given their assessments of the damage based off satellite imagery.",
      "Fordo nuclear site",
      "\"It is clear that Fordow was also directly impacted, but the degree of damage inside the uranium enrichment halls can't be determined with certainty,\" International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement on Sunday, after the U.S. bombs targeted the most secretive of the Iranian nuclear sites. Fordow is an alternate spelling for Fordo.",
      "Fordo, about 60 miles south of Tehran, is built inside a remote complex of mountains and is considered the key site to Iran's uranium enrichment research.",
      "The satellite images point to damage to Fordo in the form of several large diameter holes or craters across the site. A layer of blue ash spread over the facility also marks the impact of strikes. Additionally, several of the tunnel entrances that lead into the underground facility appear to be blocked with dirt.",
      "\"While there was uncertainty over whether the facility had been damaged by the Israeli strikes, it's certainly damaged now,\" Sam Lair, research associate at the Middlebury Institute's James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, wrote on X.",
      "\"Looks like Fordo was hit with at least six Massive Ordinance Penetrators (MOPs) given the six craters,\" Lair told ABC News. \"However, it is possible that, given the reports that perhaps as 14 MOPs were used in the operation, that each crater was hit twice to improve depth of penetration, meaning as many as 12 MOPs were used. This would be consistent with the relatively few MOP craters.\"",
      "From the position of the craters, experts believe the strikes might have hit the ventilation shafts of the facility.",
      "\"This all suggests to us the facility has probably been severely damaged. However, it is hard to be sure until someone sees the inside,\" Lair told ABC News.",
      "Experts identified the blue/gray ash visible across the site as ejecta from the MOP impacts. \"Certainly it is not a direct sign of radioactivity,\" professor Jacopo Buongiorno of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told ABC News.",
      "\"The only piece of evidence of deep penetration is the amount of ejecta that the MOPs produced, but we cannot say for certain what was destroyed,\" Decker Eveleth, an analyst at CNA, a Washington-based nonprofit, wrote on X.",
      "Finally, the tunnel entrances appear to be covered in dirt. It is unclear whether this was done by the Iranians to protect the facility or if it is the result of the American strikes, experts say.",
      "\"The US may have attempted to strike the tunnel entrances, but we also saw trucks and other heavy equipment covering them with dirt two days ago. So, it's not clear to me the US did or that it matters,\" Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies wrote on X.",
      "\"From these images and others, it looks like the tunnel entrances and the support building on site were not attacked, though the entrances had been partially buried by the Iranians in the day before the attack to help protect them,\" Lair told ABC News.",
      "Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center",
      "Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center in central Iran has extensive new damage across the facility buildings following the U.S. attack, with over a dozen appearing totally destroyed, on top of the four already hit by previous Israeli attacks.",
      "\"The latest attacks early this morning damaged other buildings in Esfahan. In addition, we have established that entrances to underground tunnels at the site were impacted,\" Grossi said in a statement on Sunday. Esfahan is an alternate spelling for Isfahan.",
      "Much of the damage to the fuel plate plant on the north side was done the night of June 20-21 by the Israelis, satellite images from before indicate.",
      "The U.S. attack, however, appears to have focused on the other part of the site, which is dedicated to the uranium conversion, according to Lair, damaging the majority of the buildings there.",
      "Natanz Nuclear Facility",
      "In Natanz, the largest Iranian nuclear enrichment center, a 18-foot diameter hole directly over part of the underground military complex is visible on top of the destruction of multiple buildings, according to Maxar, the satellite imagery service.",
      "Natanz's above-ground buildings had been heavily hit by Israeli strikes during the first week of the offensive, damaging two buildings, the electrical infrastructure, the main power supply building, as well as the emergency and backup generators, the IAEA had said.",
      "The crater appears to show how the new attack focused instead on the underground facilities of Natanz. Akin to the crater at Fordo, experts told ABC News they believe the presence of one large crater at Natanz shows that multiple MOPs were used on the facility hitting the same crater more than once, to improve the depth of penetration.",

      "The demonstration followed other anti-Bezos initiatives last week including a banner draped from the San Giorgio bell tower, one from the lagoon city\u2019s famous Rialto Bridge and posters plastered up around town complaining about the upcoming wedding and the effects of overtourism on Venice.",
      "The \u201cNo Space for Bezos\u201d movement \u2014 a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight \u2014 has united a dozen Venetian organizations including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups.",
      "Activists argue the wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over resident needs.",
      "Greenpeace said it teamed with the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, for Monday\u2019s banner. Greenpeace said it wanted to draw attention to the comparitively low taxes many billionaires pay while allegedly exacerbating the climate crisis with environmentally unsustainable lifestyles.",

      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but noted contacts began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The shootout was one of several violent incidents that has been linked to the Zizians. Members of the group have been tied to the death of one of their own during an attack on California landlord Curtis Lind in 2022, Lind's subsequent killing, and the deaths of a Pennsylvania couple.",

      "STARKE, Fla. -- A man convicted of raping and killing a woman near a central Florida bar is scheduled to be executed Tuesday.",
      "Thomas Lee Gudinas, 51, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, barring a last-day reprieve. He was convicted in the May 1994 killing of Michelle McGrath.",
      "Gudinas would be the seventh person put to death in Florida this year, with an eighth scheduled for next month. The state also executed six people in 2023, but only carried out one execution last year.",
      "A total of 23 men have been executed in the U.S. this year, with scheduled executions set to make 2025 the year with the most executions since 2015.",
      "Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second place with four each. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma has killed two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana and Tennessee each have one. Mississippi is set to join the other states on Wednesday with its first execution since 2022.",
      "McGrath was last seen at a bar called Barbarella\u2019s shortly before 3 a.m. on May 24, 1994. Her body was found with evidence of serious trauma and sexual assault in an alley next to a nearby school several hours later.",
      "Gudinas had been at the same bar with friends the night before, but they all later testified that they had left without him. A school employee who found McGrath\u2019s body later identified Gudinas as a man who was fleeing the area shortly beforehand. Another woman also identified Gudinas as the person who chased her to her car the previous night and threatened to assault her.",
      "Gudinas was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995.",
      "Attorneys for Gudinas have filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The lawyers argue in their state filing that evidence related to \u201clifelong mental illnesses\u201d exempts Gudinas from being put to death. The Florida Supreme Court denied the appeals last week, ruling that the case law that shields intellectually disabled people from execution does not apply to individuals with other forms of mental illness or brain damage.",
      "Meanwhile, a federal filing argues that the Florida governor's unfettered discretion to sign death warrants violates death row inmates' constitutional rights to due process and has led to an arbitrary process for determining who lives and who dies. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet released its decision.",

      "New York City voters will decide whether Andrew Cuomo has done enough to make a political comeback by winning the Democratic mayoral primary",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City Democrats will decide Tuesday whether to reboot Andrew Cuomo's political career, elevate liberal upstart Zohran Mamdani, or turn to a crowded field of lesser-known but maybe less-polarizing candidates in the party's mayoral primary.",
      "Their choice could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "The vote takes place on a sweltering day about four years after Cuomo resigned as governor following a sexual harassment scandal. Yet the 67-year-old has been the favorite throughout the race, with his deep experience, nearly universal name recognition, strong political connections and juggernaut fundraising apparatus.",
      "The party's progressive wing, meanwhile, has coalesced behind Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist. A relatively unknown state legislator when the contest began, Mamdani gained momentum by running a sharp campaign laser-focused on the city's high cost of living and secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.",
      "While preliminary returns will be released after the polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday, a winner might not emerge for a week because of the city's ranked choice voting system, which allows voters to list up to five candidates in order of preference. If a candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters, they win outright. If no candidate reaches that threshold, the tabulation of the rankings wouldn\u2019t begin until July 1.",
      "The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, will be on the ballot in the fall's general election.",
      "The mayoral primary\u2019s two leading candidates \u2014 one a fresh-faced progressive and the other an older moderate \u2014 could be stand-ins for the larger Democratic Party\u2019s ideological divide, though Cuomo\u2019s scandal-scarred past adds a unique tinge to the narrative.",
      "The rest of the pack has struggled to gain recognition in a race where nearly every candidate has cast themselves as the person best positioned to challenge Trump's Republican agenda.",
      "Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. It was unclear if that episode was enough to jumpstart a campaign that had been failing to pick up speed behind Lander\u2019s wonkish vibe.",
      "Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer.",
      "Mamdani's energetic run has been hard not to notice.",
      "His army of young hipster canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision \u2014 free buses, free childcare, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on the rich. He would be the city's first Indian-American and first Muslim mayor.",
      "Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. They say he doesn't have the management chops to wrangle the city's sprawling bureaucracy or handle crises. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights.",
      "In response, Mamdani has slammed Cuomo over his sexual harassment scandal and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "In one heated debate exchange, Cuomo rattled off a long list of what he saw as Mamdani's managerial shortcomings, arguing that his opponent, who has been in the state Assembly since 2021, has never dealt with Congress or unions and never overseen an infrastructure project. He added that Mamdani couldn't be relied upon to go toe-to-toe with Trump.",
      "Mamdani had a counter ready.",
      "\u201cTo Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace,\" he said.",
      "Cuomo r esigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has always maintained that he didn't intentionally harass the women, saying he had simply fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct.",
      "During the campaign, he has become more aggressive in defending himself, framing the situation as a political hit job orchestrated by his enemies.",
      "The fresh scandal at City Hall involving Mayor Eric Adams, though, gave Cuomo a path to end his exile.",

      "Aimee Gutierrez said in a social media post that her family several weeks earlier had adopted a 9-month-old Belgian Malinois and named her Saint. She said the person they trusted to help train Saint informed her by text that Saint had died in her sleep.",

      "All but one of the dogs was dropped off at crematoriums last Wednesday. The body of the first dog was dropped off on June 13.",
      "Sit worked throughout Southern California under different company names, including Happy K9 Academy, police said. A website with that company name lists Tony Sit as the author of its blog posts. It says their services include boarding and training but doesn't give a boarding facility address or other specific information. An address listed on the website is that of a public park in Tustin, California.",

      "A Border Patrol agent was seen hitting a Southern California landscaper on the head and neck as he was pinned to the ground during an arrest Saturday. The Department of Homeland Security said the man swung his weed trimmer at agents. The man\u2019s son, Alejandro Barranco, a Marine veteran, said his father was scared but did not attack anyone.",

Until then, the agency primarily responsible for interior enforcement is relying on other federal agencies as it struggles to meet a daily arrest target of at least 3,000 set by Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and chief architect of immigration policy.",
      "ICE, with only about 6,000 deportation officers, has found a ready partner in the Border Patrol, which is also part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It comes at a time when border arrests plunged to an average of 282 a day in May after peaking at more than 8,000 a day in December 2023.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re here and not going away,\u201d Bovino said, introducing himself to reporters as his agency\u2019s top representative during ICE-led operations in Los Angeles.",
      "Few see any reason to doubt the Border Patrol will remain.",

      "Agents are granted by federal law the ability to stop and question people within 100 miles (161 kilometers) of the border, including the coasts. They have heightened authority to board and search buses, trains and vessels without a warrant within the zone.",
      "That encompasses vast swaths of the country that include about two-thirds of the U.S. population, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Los Angeles is well within 100 miles of the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Beyond that zone, agents are still authorized to work within the United States.",
      "\"The Border Patrol can still operate fully in the interior. It\u2019s just that they have less authority to stop and question people,\u201d said Reichlin-Melnick.",
      "Past the 100-mile enforcement zone, Border Patrol agents, like officers working for ICE or the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations, are classified as immigration officers who are authorized to carry out arrests and detain people on suspicion of violating immigration law. There are some limits.",
      "\u201cThey could only search somebody's car on probable cause that the person has violated the law,\" Reichlin-Melnick said. \u201cAnd so people have somewhat heightened rights against search and seizure outside of the 100-mile zone than they do inside of the 100-mile zone. But each individual case will vary depending on the specific circumstances.\"",

      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The roadless rule adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \u201cresponsible timber production\u201d that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\u201cThis move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation\u2019s forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say that worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has allowed fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres (24 million hectares), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \u201cera of abundance\u201d on public lands under President Donald Trump's administration in the development of natural resources including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \u201cnot for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \u201cThis land belongs to you and me\u201d and \u201ckeep our public land free for future generations.\u201d",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \u201canother example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\u201d",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\u201cAny attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\u201d Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA\u2019s plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\u201cThis is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\u201d Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home to the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Trump\u2019s first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans have hit a roadblock in an effort that could deter nonprofits, individuals and other potential litigants from filing lawsuits to block President Donald Trump over his executive actions.",
      "As Trump faces lawsuits nationwide, GOP lawmakers had sought to bar federal courts from issuing temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions against the federal government unless the plaintiffs post what in many cases would be a massive financial bond at the beginning of the case.",
      "The proposal was included in the Senate version of Trump's massive tax and immigration bill, but ran into trouble with the Senate parliamentarian, who said it violates the chamber's rules. It is now unlikely to be in the final package.",
      "Federal judges can already require plaintiffs to post security bonds, but such funds are commonly waived in public interest cases. The GOP proposal would make the payment of the financial bond a requirement before a judge could make a ruling, which critics said would have a chilling effect on potential litigants who wouldn't have the resources to comply.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer hailed the parliamentarian's ruling in a press statement and called the GOP effort \u201cnothing short of an assault on the system of checks and balances that has anchored the nation since it's founding.\u201d",

      "Lawmakers are running scores of provisions by the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s office to ensure they fit with the chamber's rules for inclusion in a reconciliation bill. The recommendations from Elizabeth MacDonough will have a major impact on the final version of the legislation.",
      "On Friday, she determined that a proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states would violate the chamber\u2019s rules. But some of the most difficult questions are still to come as Republicans hope to get a bill passed and on Trump's desk to be signed into law before July 4th.",
      "Republicans could still seek to include the judiciary provision in the bill, but it would likely be challenged and subject to a separate vote in which the provision would need 60 votes to remain. The parliamentarian's advice, while not binding, is generally followed by the Senate.",
      "Republicans and the White House have been highly critical of some of the court rulings blocking various Trump orders on immigration, education and voting. The courts have agreed to block the president in a number of cases, and the administration is seeking appeals as well.",
      "In April, the House voted to limit the scope of injunctive relief ordered by a district judge to those parties before the court, rather than applying the relief nationally. But that bill is unlikely to advance in the Senate since it would need 60 votes to advance. That's left Republicans looking for other avenues to blunt the court orders.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you the truth, I\u2019m worried about it for the runoff, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\" Calhoun said of the July 15 Democratic runoff between Waites and Hubbard.",
      "Statewide turnout for the primary on June 17 reached just 2.8% of Georgia's 7.4 million active registered voters. That includes more than 15,000 people who likely voted for Blackman and didn't have their votes counted.",
      "But the Democratic runoff might struggle to reach 1% turnout statewide. And counties could spend $10 million statewide to hold the election, based on a sampling of some county spending. That could be more than $100 per vote.",
      "People who want to change Georgia's runoff system say this election shows how the state spends money only to have decisions made by a fraction of people who voted the first time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible waste of resources,\" said state Rep. Saira Draper, an Atlanta Democrat.",
      "But key Republicans are opposed to two methods used elsewhere \u2014 letting someone win without a majority or using ranked choice voting to determine a majority. In the meantime, some Republican-dominated counties are using a state law to reduce the number of polling places for the runoff.",
      "In many states, finishing first is enough to win, even if it\u2019s far short of a majority. Georgia is one of only nine states, mostly in the South, that require runoffs. And it\u2019s one of only two states, along with Mississippi, that demand a runoff if no candidate wins a general election majority after a partisan primary.",
      "Historians say runoffs were created in part to make it harder for Black candidates to win office, giving white voters a chance to unify around a candidate.",
      "Georgia legislators in 1995 lowered the threshold to avoid a runoff, requiring a candidate to a earn only a 45% plurality. Republicans changed the threshold back to a majority after a GOP candidate lost a 1996 Senate race.",
      "Draper introduced a bill in 2023 to lower the threshold back to 45%, but it went nowhere. House Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Victor Anderson, a Cornelia Republican, is among many who believes a majority is an important electoral mandate.",
      "\u201cTo actually win an election you should receive, in one form or fashion, at least 50% plus one of the vote. And so I am not in favor of a plurality system,\" said Anderson, whose committee oversees election legislation.",
      "Another option would be letting voters rank their choices and determining the winner using second or third choices. That's the system New York City voters are using to elect a mayor.",
      "Scot Turner, a former Republican state representative who champions that system, said turnout is typically lower for runoffs, silencing voters who don't return. He said ranked choice voting would broaden participation, ensure a majority chooses the winner and save money.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tweak of our existing system that maximizes turnout and lowers cost,\u201d Turner said. \u201cBecause we see these massive drop-offs in turnout for runoffs, those are disenfranchised voters. Their votes are tossed as if they never were cast.\u201d",
      "Georgia issues ranked-choice ballots to military and overseas voters. But many Republicans oppose expansion, with the Georgia Senate passing bills to ban its further use.",
      "What some counties are doing is limiting the number of polling places for the runoff.",
      "State law allows a county to open only one polling place for a primary runoff if fewer than 1% of a county's registered voters cast ballots in the initial primary. That's likely to apply to some Republican-dominated counties. A few rural counties, including Miller County, already operate only one voting location.",
      "Cherokee County, with nearly 208,000 active voters, announced Friday that it would open only one polling place after fewer than 2,000 people cast ballots in the Democratic primary. Elections Director Anne Dover said the decision would cut the cost of the runoff in half, saving about $70,000.",
      "Travis Doss, president of the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials, said Friday that as many as 20 counties are considering that option.",

      "A federal jury has awarded $500,000 to the widow and estate of a police officer who killed himself nine days after he helped defend the U.S. Capitol from a mob of rioters, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the attack",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal jury on Monday awarded $500,000 to the widow and estate of a police officer who killed himself nine days after he helped defend the U.S. Capitol from a mob of rioters, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the attack.",
      "The eight-member jury ordered that man, 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, to pay $380,000 in punitive damages and $60,000 in compensatory damages to Erin Smith for assaulting her husband, Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering.",
      "The judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Erin Smith\u2019s wrongful-death claim against Walls-Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman\u2019s actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith\u2019s death.",
      "Walls-Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. He says any injuries that the officer suffered on Jan. 6 occurred later in the day, when another rioter threw a pole that struck Smith around his head.",
      "On Friday, the jury sided with Erin Smith and held Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35-year-old husband \u2014 an encounter captured on the officer's body camera.",
      "\u201cErin is grateful to receive some measure of justice,\u201d said David P. Weber, one of her attorneys.",
      "Walls-Kaufman said the outcome of the trial is \u201cabsolutely ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo crime happened. I never struck the officer. I never intended to strike the officer,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm just stunned.\u201d",
      "After the jury left the courtroom, Reyes encouraged the parties to confer and discuss a possible settlement to avoid the time and expense of an appeal and for the sake of \u201cfinality.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou guys settle, you can move on with your lives,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Walls-Kaufman's attorney, Hughie Hunt, described the jury's award as \u201cshocking.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're talking about a three-second event,\u201d he told the judge.",
      "\u201cIt's not shocking, Mr. Hunt. A lot of things can happen in three seconds,\u201d Reyes replied.",
      "Jeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol riot when he shot and killed himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the Jan. 6 riot. Erin Smith claims Walls-Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide.",
      "The police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he killed himself. In 2022, the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters\u2019 Retirement and Relief Board determined that Smith was injured in the line of duty and the injury was the \u201csole and direct cause of his death,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "Walls-Kaufman served a 60-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor in January 2023, but he was pardoned in January. On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack.",
      "More than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes. Howard Liebengood, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack.",
      "Erin Smith's quest isn't over. She applied for the National Law Enforcement Memorial to add her husband's name as a line-of-duty death. Weber said they're hoping for a decision soon.",

      "SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. -- Divers searched a section of Lake Tahoe on Monday for two people still missing after six others were killed when a boat capsized during a powerful weekend thunderstorm that whipped up high waves, authorities said.",
      "Ten people were on board the 27-foot (8-meter) gold Chris-Craft vessel when it flipped Saturday afternoon near D.L. Bliss State Park on the lake\u2019s southwest edge, U.S. Coast Guard officials said.",
      "Two people were rescued immediately and taken to a hospital in unknown condition. Six bodies were recovered later Saturday, said Sgt. Kyle Parker with the El Dorado County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Their names won\u2019t be released until family members are notified, he said.",
      "The intensity of the thunderstorm surprised even forecasters, who had predicted some rain but nothing like the sudden squall that lashed the southern part of the lake around 3 p.m., said meteorologist Matthew Chyba with the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nevada. Winds topped 35 mph (56 kph) and waves swelled more than 8 feet (2.5 meters).",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting it to be so strong,\u201d Chyba said Monday. He said temperatures in the area were 15 to 25 degrees below normal for this time of year, which could have contributed to the unstable air mass.",
      "Eight-foot waves on Tahoe is \u201cpretty significant,\u201d Chyba said. \u201cThey were really rocking the lake.\u201d",
      "Lake Tahoe is a popular summer recreation destination for boaters, kayakers and paddleboarders. The pristine lake with very cold water straddles California and Nevada and is one of the deepest in the country, second only to Oregon's Crater Lake.",
      "Rescue crews and divers scoured the area Saturday evening for the remaining two victims and resumed efforts Sunday morning before the Coast Guard eventually called off its search. El Dorado County sheriff's deputies continued searching Monday with help from other agencies from California and neighboring Nevada, Parker said.",
      "The storm Saturday cleared out within about two hours.",
      "Chris Williams, a party boat operator with Tahoe Sports, was one of four company captains on the lake Saturday when the weather turned. He was stunned by the force of the storm and the size of the swells.",
      "\u201cWe braved the weather and came back during some severe wave heights that have never been seen on Lake Tahoe,\u201d Williams told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cWe were pushing the vessels to their maximum capabilities while making sure to keep all clients safely aboard.\u201d",
      "While all guests from Tahoe Sports charters returned safely, Williams said two boats from the company\u2019s Tahoe Keys location broke from the pier and washed ashore.",
      "Video obtained by KCRA-TV showed moored boats at a nearby marina crashing into one another amid strong gusts.",

      "Florida condominium residents grappling with the steep cost of building improvements will get some financial relief under a new bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday.",
      "The new measure gives condo homeowner associations more flexibility in how to build up their reserve funds and eases some requirements for safety assessments.",
      "Approval came the day before the fourth anniversary of the partial collapse of Champlain Towers South, which killed 98 people in Surfside in 2021. The new law goes into effect July 1 and is aimed at reforming a condo safety law passed in 2022 in the wake of that disaster.",
      "Speaking at Monday\u2019s bill signing in Clearwater, Republican state Sen. Ed Hooper said the 2022 law was meant to ensure there was never another collapse like Surfside. In retrospect, he said some of the requirements enacted were probably an overreaction, which lawmakers are now hoping to correct.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to make the change,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cElderly people are losing their condos because they could not afford to make the increase in their monthly HOA fees. That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d",
      "Condo owners in Florida faced rising costs under the 2022 law, which requires condo associations to have sufficient reserves to cover major repairs. In the aftermath of the Surfside disaster, some residents were caught off guard by hefty fees levied to cover years of deferred maintenance expenses required to bring their buildings into compliance with the 2022 legislation.",
      "The mounting costs to cover renovations and build up reserve funds have strained residents in the condo haven of South Florida, especially retirees and those living on fixed incomes.",
      "Condo owners along the state\u2019s southwest coast have taken the extra hit of last year\u2019s back-to-back hurricanes, which clobbered waterfront communities in the Tampa Bay area and forced additional renovations and repairs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a full-time job for me keeping track of this,\u201d condo owner Earle Cooper said of the repairs to his building in Belleair. \u201cHurricanes just multiply the problems.\u201d",
      "The new measure allows certain condo associations to fund their reserves through a loan or line of credit. It also gives residents greater flexibility to pause payments into their reserve funds while they prioritize needed repairs and extends the deadline for associations to complete structural integrity studies. Some smaller buildings will be exempt from having to do those analyses.",
      "\u201cI think that this will provide relief,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cBut to the extent that there needs to be some cleanup next year when the legislature reconvenes, we got to be willing to do that.\u201d ___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "A new poll shows Americans\u2019 support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents",
      "Americans\u2019 support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents.",
      "The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults\u2019 support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.",
      "The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump's Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump's energy policies.",
      "The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults \u2014 including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans \u2014 approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.",
      "About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn\u2019t changed measurably.",
      "\u201cAs far as the pollution goes ... the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,\u201d said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That's partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.",
      "The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.",
      "\u201cFor solar panels, in all honesty, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that efficient yet,\u201d said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. \u201cI\u2019d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that\u2019s just my thought.\u201d",
      "Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump\u2019s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.",
      "Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.",
      "When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.",
      "\u201cI think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,\u201d Andrews said.",
      "Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.",
      "Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.",
      "In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.",
      "Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.",
      "The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.",
      "The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.",
      "Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. \u201cIt seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can\u2019t afford new ones,\u201d he said.",
      "The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d confident in the federal government\u2019s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are \u201csomewhat\u201d confident in the federal government\u2019s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident.",
      "The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California\u2019s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas.

      "Brian Anthony Browning's mother attended the CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne in spurts but was not a regular member, Pastor Bobby Kelly said. She was not there Sunday, said Kelly, who recalled meeting her son late last year.",
      "\u201cHe first came when his mother invited him, and I met him,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe seemed to really have some thoughts that were not threatening or anything like that, but he definitely had some thoughts as far as hearing from God.\u201d",
      "Children from the church's vacation Bible school were leading Sunday's worship and were just finishing up their last song when the congregation heard gunfire outside. Kelly, who was about to start his sermon, initially thought the noise was a jackhammer or a problem with the sound system.",
      "\u201cThe third time is when we knew something was going on, because it was very close, and then one of our security team members came into the sanctuary doors from the lobby and told everyone to get out,\u201d he said.",
      "A livestream video shows people carrying children or directing them to get down and move away.",
      "\u201cC\u2019mon, everybody to the back,\u201d a woman calls out. The woman, who was initially crouching between two rows of seats, stands and waves an arm. \u201cPlease, everyone come to the back!\u201d",
      "People, some of them ducking their heads, rush out as others can be heard yelling \u201cGo!\u201d and \u201cCome on!\u201d",
      "A loud crack is heard and people cry out. Those remaining run and walk quickly out of sight.",
      "Browning, 31, did not have any previous contacts with local police or a criminal history, but may have been suffering a mental health crisis, the Wayne Police Department said in a news release.",
      "Kelly said a church member arriving late to the service spotted Browning driving recklessly and called out to him as he exited his car wearing a tactical vest and carrying a rifle and a handgun. The church member struck Browning with his pickup truck.",
      "\u201cHe is a hero,\" Kelly said of the parishioner. \u201cI think that was the Lord leading him to do that. He hit this individual with his car, drove right on the grass because he was shooting at the building at the time. And that certainly helped the team to be able to respond.\u201d",
      "The man began firing as he approached the church, striking one person in the leg. At least two staff members shot him, Police Chief Ryan Strong said. About 150 people were inside the church at the time.",
      "\"We are grateful for the heroic actions of the church\u2019s staff members, who undoubtedly saved many lives and prevented a large-scale mass shooting,\u201d the chief said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "One member of the security team was shot in the leg and was listed in stable condition at a hospital after undergoing surgery, the news release said. No one else was hurt.",
      "Wayne is a city of about 17,000 people located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Detroit.

      "People fearful of being arrested for wearing masks while protesting immigration raids in Los Angeles and other cities have voiced anger over Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents covering their faces",
      "CHICAGO -- President Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly called for mask-wearing at protests to be banned and for protesters whose faces are covered to be arrested, with the most recent push following demonstrations in Los Angeles over immigration raids.",
      "Legal experts told The Associated Press there are a variety of reasons people may want to cover their faces while protesting, including to protect their health, for religious reasons, to avoid government retaliation, to prevent surveillance and doxing, or to protect themselves from tear gas. With legislative action happening across the U.S., they say it's only a matter of time before the issue returns to the courts.",
      "Protesters, meanwhile, have voiced anger over footage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents covering their faces at immigration raids and masked officers at the Los Angeles protests, calling it a double standard.",
      "Here are some things to know about the debate over face masks:",
      "At least 18 states and Washington, D.C., have laws that restrict masks and other face coverings in some way, said Elly Page, senior legal adviser with the International Center for Not-For-Profit Law. Since October 2023, at least 16 bills have been introduced in eight states and Congress to restrict masks at protests, according to the center.",
      "Many of these laws date back to the 1940s and \u201950s when many states passed anti-mask laws as a response to the Ku Klux Klan, whose members hid their identities while terrorizing victims. Amid protests against the war in Gaza and the Republican president\u2019s immigration policies, Page said there have been attempts to revive these rarely used laws to target protesters, sometimes inconsistently.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to arrest protesters for wearing masks came as federal agents were seen donning masks while conducting raids in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities.",
      "Democratic lawmakers in California have introduced legislation aiming to stop federal agents and local police officers from wearing face masks amid concerns that ICE agents were attempting to hide their identities and avoid accountability for potential misconduct during high-profile immigration raids.",
      "The issue also came up at a congressional hearing on June 12, when Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized ICE agents wearing masks during raids, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t wear masks. Identify who you are.\u201d",
      "Republican federal officials have maintained that masks protect agents from doxing. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the California bill \u201cdespicable.\"",
      "Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor, said the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the right to free speech includes the right to speak out anonymously. But he said how it should apply to protesters wearing masks remains \u201can unresolved First Amendment question.\u201d",
      "For Stone, that raises a key question: Why should protesters and ICE agents be subject to different rules?",
      "\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want them to be targeted because they engaged in their responsibilities as ICE agents,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the same thing as the argument as to why you want demonstrators to wear masks. They want to wear masks so they can do their \u2018jobs\u2019 of engaging in free speech properly. The same rationale for the officers wearing masks should apply to the protesters.\u201d",

      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",

Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",

He\u2019s worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \u201cnot a very political person\u201d but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all for \u2018get the criminals out of the country,\u2019 right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s always been a way to secure a green card.\u201d",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \u201cno idea\u201d about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \u201cploy.\u201d",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\u201d said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \u201cYou take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\u201d",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \u201cis in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \u201cnot going to ignore the rule of law.\u201d",
      "\u201cIgnoring an Immigration Judge\u2019s order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\u201d U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \u201chas a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\u201d",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\u201cShe was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \u201cwill no longer exempt\u201d from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \u201cprotection from deportation\u201d for family members.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\u201d Stock said. \u201cIt sends the wrong message to the recruits.\u201d",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \u201cnot the proper authority\u201d to \u201cimply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\u201d",

      "The clerk of a tiny Kentucky county who became known for denying same-sex marriage licenses is still fighting the Supreme Court decision 10 years later",
      "The Kentucky county clerk who became known around the world for her opposition to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage is still arguing in court that it should be overturned.",
      "Kim Davis became a cultural lightning rod 10 years ago, bringing national media and conservative religious leaders to eastern Kentucky as she continued for weeks to deny the licenses. She later met Pope Francis in Rome and was parodied on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "Davis began denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015.",
      "Videos of a same-sex couple arguing with Davis in the clerk\u2019s office over their denial of a license drew national attention to her office.",
      "She defied court orders to issue the licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court in September 2015. Davis was released after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form.",
      "The Kentucky Legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.",
      "Davis said her faith forbade her from what she saw as an endorsement of same-sex marriage. Faith leaders and conservative political leaders including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and then-Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin rallied to her cause.",
      "After her release from jail, Davis addressed the media, saying that issuing same-sex marriage licenses \u201cwould be conflicting with God\u2019s definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. This would be an act of disobedience to my God.\u201d",
      "Davis declined a request for an interview from The Associated Press for this story.",
      "In 2018, one of the men who had confronted Davis over her defiance ran for her office. David Ermold said he believed people in Rowan County were sick of Davis and wanted to move on.",
      "When he went to file his papers for the Democratic primary, Davis, a Republican, was there in her capacity as clerk to sign him up. Sitting across a desk from each other, the cordial meeting contrasted the first time they met three years earlier.",
      "Both candidates lost; Ermold in the primary and Davis in the general election. She has not returned to politics.",
      "Davis' lawyers are attempting again to get her case before the Supreme Court, after the high court declined to hear an appeal from her in 2020.",
      "A federal judge has ordered Davis to pay a total of $360,000 in damages and attorney fees to Ermold and his partner.",
      "Davis lost a bid in March to have her appeal of that ruling heard by a federal appeals court, but she will appeal again to the Supreme Court. Her attorney, Mat Staver of the Liberty Counsel, said the goal is affirm Davis' constitutional rights and \u201coverturn Obergefell.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The massive tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump wants on his desk by July 4 would loosen regulations on gun silencers and certain types of rifles and shotguns",
      "WASHINGTON -- The massive tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump wants on his desk by July 4 would loosen regulations on gun silencers and certain types of rifles and shotguns, advancing a longtime priority of the gun industry as Republican leaders in the House and Senate try to win enough votes to pass the bill.",
      "The guns provision was first requested in the House by Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Republican gun store owner who had initially opposed the larger tax package. The House bill would remove silencers \u2014 called \u201csuppressors\u201d by the gun industry \u2014 from a 1930s law that regulates firearms that are considered the most dangerous, eliminating a $200 tax while removing a layer of background checks.",
      "The Senate kept the provision on silencers in its version of the bill and expanded upon it, adding short-barreled, or sawed-off, rifles and shotguns.",
      "Republicans who have long supported the changes, along with the gun industry, say the tax infringes on Second Amendment rights. They say silencers are mostly used by hunters and target shooters for sport.",
      "\u201cBurdensome regulations and unconstitutional taxes shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of protecting American gun owners\u2019 hearing,\u201d said Clyde, who owns two gun stores in Georgia and often wears a pin shaped like an assault rifle on his suit lapel.",
      "Democrats are fighting to stop the provision, which was unveiled days after two Minnesota state legislators were shot in their homes, as the bill speeds through the Senate. They argue that loosening regulations on silencers could make it easier for criminals and active shooters to conceal their weapons.",
      "\u201cParents don\u2019t want silencers on their streets, police don\u2019t want silencers on their streets,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "The gun language has broad support among Republicans and has received little attention as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., work to settle differences within the party on cuts to Medicaid and energy tax credits, among other issues. But it is just one of hundreds of policy and spending items included to entice members to vote for the legislation that could have broad implications if the bill is enacted within weeks, as Trump wants.",
      "Inclusion of the provision is also a sharp turn from the climate in Washington just three years ago when Democrats, like Republicans now, controlled Congress and the White House and pushed through bipartisan gun legislation. The bill increased background checks for some buyers under the age of 21, made it easier to take firearms from potentially dangerous people and sent millions of dollars to mental health services in schools.",
      "Passed in the summer of 2022, just weeks after the shooting of 19 children and two adults at a school in Uvalde, Texas, it was the most significant legislative response to gun violence in decades.",
      "Three years later, as they try to take advantage of their consolidated power in Washington, Republicans are packing as many of their longtime priorities as possible, including the gun legislation, into the massive, wide-ranging bill that Trump has called \u201cbeautiful.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad the Senate is joining the House to stand up for the Second Amendment and our Constitution, and I will continue to fight for these priorities as the Senate works to pass President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who was one of the lead negotiators on the bipartisan gun bill in 2022 but is now facing a primary challenge from the right in his bid for reelection next year.",
      "If the gun provisions remain in the larger legislation and it is passed, silencers and the short-barrel rifles and shotguns would lose an extra layer of regulation that they are subject to under the National Firearms Act, passed in the 1930s in response to concerns about mafia violence. They would still be subject to the same regulations that apply to most other guns \u2014 and that includes possible loopholes that allow some gun buyers to avoid background checks when guns are sold privately or online.",
      "Larry Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who supports the legislation, says changes are aimed at helping target shooters and hunters protect their hearing. He argues that the use of silencers in violent crimes is rare. \u201cAll it\u2019s ever intended to do is to reduce the report of the firearm to hearing safe levels,\u201d Keane says.",
      "Speaking on the floor before the bill passed the House, Rep. Clyde said the bill restores Second Amendment rights from \u201cover 90 years of draconian taxes.\u201d Clyde said Johnson included his legislation in the larger bill \u201cwith the purest of motive.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho asked for it? I asked,\u201d said Clyde, who ultimately voted for the bill after the gun silencer provision was added.",
      "Clyde was responding to Rep. Maxwell Frost, a 28-year-old Florida Democrat, who went to the floor and demanded to know who was responsible for the gun provision. Frost, who was a gun-control activist before being elected to Congress, called himself a member of the \u201cmass shooting generation\u201d and said the bill would help \u201cgun manufacturers make more money off the death of children and our people.\u201d",
      "Among other concerns, control advocates say less regulation for silencers could make it harder for law enforcement to stop an active shooter.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason silencers have been regulated for nearly a century: They make it much harder for law enforcement and bystanders to react quickly to gunshots,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "Schumer and other Democrats are trying to convince the Senate parliamentarian to drop the language as she reviews the bill for policy provisions that aren\u2019t budget-related.",
      "\u201cSenate Democrats will fight this provision at the parliamentary level and every other level with everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d Schumer said earlier this month.",

      "WASHINGTON -- For more than a week, President Donald Trump kept the world wondering whether he would join Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran in an attempt to decapitate the country\u2019s nuclear program. The guessing ended this weekend, when American stealth bombers, fighter jets and a submarine struck with bombs and missiles.",

      "Like most of Trump\u2019s presidency, the path to military action was unconventional and played out on social media, as he alternatively pledged diplomacy, demanded the evacuation of Tehran, threatened the ayatollah and ultimately announced the U.S. strike.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how the last 11 days unfolded, a cascade of events that could reshape a combustible corner of the globe. All dates below are in Eastern time.",
      "The first sign that conflict could be on the horizon came when families of U.S. troops began leaving the Middle East. \u201cThey are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place, and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said as he arrived at the Kennedy Center for opening night of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d one of his favorite musicals.",
      "It wasn't clear whether Israel was preparing to strike, fulfilling years of threats to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program, or if the movements were a feint to increase pressure for negotiations. The next round of talks between Washington and Tehran was just days away, and Trump was adamant about reaching a diplomatic solution.",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israeli military operation was already taking shape.",
      "Trump said an attack by Israel \u201ccould very well happen.\u201d But Iran still seemed to be taken by surprise. Around 8 p.m. in Washington, explosions in Tehran killed top military leaders and scientists. Multiple sites connected to Iran\u2019s nuclear program were also hit.",
      "Israel said 200 warplanes took part in the first wave of attacks. More damage was done with drones that Israeli spies had smuggled into the country, destroying air defenses and missile launchers.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as a \u201ctargeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel\u2019s very survival.\u201d Although Iran has long maintained that its nuclear program was for peaceful purposes, Israeli leaders claimed it was an imminent threat.",
      "Trump posted on social media that \u201cwe remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution,\u201d but his tone would soon change.",
      "Iran retaliated against Israel with missiles and drones, many of which were shot down by air defenses. As Trump started his day in Washington, he seemed impressed by Israeli military prowess and his tone became more aggressive toward Iran.",
      "\u201cThe United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "But Trump suggested that diplomacy was his first choice, and urged Iran to make a deal. \u201cNow they have, perhaps, a second chance\u201d to get it done, he said.",
      "Trump talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the morning, and they discussed the conflict between Israel and Iran. The next round of talks between the U.S. and Iran was canceled.",
      "As Israel and Iran continued to trade strikes, Trump attended a military parade in Washington. It was the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, as well as his 79th birthday.",
      "The muscular display of American military might \u2014 tanks, troops, paratroopers and a 21-gun salute \u2014 played out in the nation's capital as the potential for a new conflict loomed.",
      "Trump spent the day talking up his reputation as a peacemaker, encouraging Iran and Israel to \u201cmake a deal\u201d similar to how he had brokered an end to fighting between India and Pakistan.",
      "\u201cMany calls and meetings now taking place,\u201d Trump wrote on social media. \u201cI do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114687664442020232",
      "Iran\u2019s health ministry said 224 people had been killed by Israeli strikes at this point in the conflict. Reports also emerged that Trump had rejected an Israeli plan to kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. U.S. officials viewed the idea as dangerously destabilizing.",
      "Trump flew to Canada for the annual Group of Seven summit, which gathers the world\u2019s most powerful democracies. He would not be there long.",
      "Israel claimed it had achieved \u201caerial superiority\u201d over Tehran, allowing its warplanes to operate freely in the skies above Iran\u2019s capital. One of the strikes hit Iran\u2019s state-run television, abruptly stopping a live broadcast. Netanyahu said Israeli strikes set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program a \u201cvery, very long time.\u201d",
      "However, the extent of the damage was unclear, and U.S. and Israeli officials believed only American planes with specially designed \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs had the capability to destroy nuclear sites buried deep underground.",
      "After a single day at the G7 summit, the White House abruptly announced that Trump would leave early on a red-eye flight to Washington to meet with his national security team.",
      "Trump demanded Iran\u2019s \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER\u201d in a post on social media and he told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wanted \u201ca real end\u201d to the conflict, not just a ceasefire.",
      "He expressed frustration with Iranian leaders for failing to reach an agreement. \u201cThey should have done the deal. I told them, \u2018Do the deal,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not too much in the mood to negotiate.\u201d",
      "Trump also brushed off assessments from U.S. spy agencies that Iran hadn\u2019t decided to build a nuclear weapon. He insisted they were \u201cvery close.\u201d",
      "The sun had not yet risen when Trump arrived at the White House. He took part in a meeting in the Situation Room, but did not appear publicly.",
      "With little clarity on next steps, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters that \"I\u2019m here to take questions, not necessarily answer them.\u201d",
      "By this point, there was no question that Trump was considering joining Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran. \u201cI may do it, I may not do it,\u201d he said that morning. \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "The president spoke to reporters while overseeing the installation of a massive new flagpole on the South Lawn of the White House, toggling back and forth between chatting up construction workers in hard hats and sizing up the Iranian nuclear threat.",
      "Later, in the Oval Office, Trump again suggested that the U.S. might get directly involved to thwart Iran\u2019s atomic ambitions. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.\u201d",
      "On Capitol Hill, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers the Pentagon was presenting Trump with military options.",
      "It was a federal holiday \u2014 Juneteenth \u2014 and much of Washington took the hot, steamy day off, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt scheduled a briefing nonetheless.",
      "She entered the briefing room to deliver a message from the president: He would decide within two weeks whether to become directly involved in Israel\u2019s war on Iran.",
      "Trump has long been known to toss out \u201ctwo week\u201d deadlines for actions that never materialize, so the statement left people guessing on his next move.",
      "Trump convened another meeting of his national security advisers and then flew to his golf club in New Jersey, where he attended a political fundraiser in the evening. He talked to reporters briefly en route, long enough to say his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was \u201cwrong\u201d when she previously said that the U.S. believed Iran wasn\u2019t building a nuclear weapon.",
      "Around midnight, the U.S. military operation began in secret: B-2 stealth bombers taking off from a base in Missouri. They headed east, over the Atlantic Ocean, refueling from airborne tankers along the way. It would take them 18 hours to reach Iran. A decoy flight went west, toward the Pacific.",
      "Trump returned to the White House from New Jersey around 6 p.m. Less than an hour later, American ordinance began exploding in Tehran.",
      "More than two dozen Tomahawk missiles were fired from a U.S. submarine. Fighter jets scanned for Iranian interceptors. The stealth bombers dropped 14 bunker buster bombs, marking the first time that the 30,000-pound weapon had been used in combat.",
      "Trump announced the strikes on social media, saying it was a \u201cvery successful attack and \u201cNOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!\u201d In a brief national address from the White House, the president threatened to attack Iran again if there was any retaliation.",
      "\u201cThere will either be peace or there will be tragedy for Iran,\u201d he said.",

      "And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. \"When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world \u2013 a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, \"There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'\"",
      "The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. \"It was me, Abby, my fianc\u00e9e, and my mom,\" he said. \"We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'\"",
      "His fianc\u00e9e is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying.",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. \"It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!\" Patrick laughed.",
      "His best friends are his family.  They're also his greatest fans.  When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from \"The White Lotus,\" as a standout among standouts \u2013 the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism.",
      "In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's \"Actors on Actors,\"\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus.\"",
      "Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: \"There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,\" Arnold said. \"My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\"",
      "Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. \"I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that.\"",
      "He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money \u2013 how to run a business, how to create a brand. \"My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,\" said Patrick. \"And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell.\"",
      "He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all \u2013 and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics.",
      "Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, \"I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back.\"",
      "Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular. He spent a decade in acting class, building a resume one part at a time, recently acting opposite Colin Firth in the HBO mini-series, \"The Staircase.\" That, he said, \"was the first time that the people in the industry were able to see me in a dramatic role. ... Before, people maybe didn't take me serious. They didn't know if I was really, you know, in it for the long haul, was I really working on my craft?\"",
      "WATCH: \"The White Lotus\" clip: Saxon and TimothyIn this scene, Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) demands to know from his dad, Timothy (Jason Isaacs)\u00a0 whether everything is OK at the office. [Spoiler alert: Everything is NOT OK at the office.]",
      "He hopes his next role will be a character with a few less character flaws than Saxon Ratliff. That said, Patrick Schwarzenegger would happily check back into the White Lotus anytime Mike White asks. \"I said, if you don't hire me again, I'll come and be the head of craft services,\" he said. \"I'll come and hire me as your scouting location guy because I just want to come in and be part of the journey.\"",

    "story": [
      "In 1967, this video introduced a new American band: The Doors, who would quickly light the music world on fire, with a sound hypnotic, mystical, and almost menacing:",
      "You know the day destroys the night Night divides the day Tried to run, tried to hide Break on through to the other side Break on through to the other side Break on through to the other side, yeah",
      "They came together 60 years ago in Venice, California: Jim Morrison, a poet in leather pants, backed by Ray Manzarek on keys, Robby Krieger on guitar, and John Densmore on drums.",
      "The Doors soon got their break, in May of '66, at London Fog, a tiny nightclub on the Sunset Strip. It's now a barber shop. \"Oh, I need a haircut,\" laughed Densmore on a recent return visit.",
      "The barber shop's owner, Chad Oringer, an avid Doors fan, asked for a photo with Densmore and Krieger, the band's last surviving members.",
      "The Doors were fired by London Fog, but quickly got another gig just a few doors down Sunset, at the Whisky a Go Go. Playing there, said Krieger, was \"the biggest deal in town.\"",
      "\"It was Mecca,\" Densmore added.",
      "The room isn't much different from what it was back then. \"The stage is lower,\" Densmore said. People would dance in front of the stage. \"And they would just all be down there writhing around. Very inspirational!\" he laughed.",
      "He described the improvisational attitude of the band: \"Ray handed me a crumpled piece of paper and it said, 'Day destroys the night. Night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide \u2026 Break on through.'\"",
      "Morrison had never sung lead before, and Densmore wasn't sure about him at first: \"He was so shy, it was ridiculous. And I thought, 'This is not the next Mick Jagger! But I love playing music, so I'll fool around here.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did you have confidence the band would work if he was so inexperienced as a singer?\"",
      "\"It was the words,\" Krieger said. \"They were so different than anything that was out there.\"",
      "\"Gifted,\" said Densmore. \"'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide\u2026 ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!\"",
      "In 1967, Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond began playing their records on his show, \"The Diamond Mine.\" Krieger said, \"And he would call us all the time and say, 'Hey, man. Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'\"",
      "\"Light My Fire,\" written by Krieger, went to #1.",
      "But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, \"At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'\"",
      "\"You knew that right away?\" I asked.",
      "\"Kinda sensed it.\"",
      "\"Was that hard to accept?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Densmore said. \"I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction.\"",
      "After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. \"At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,\" Densmore said.",
      "Krieger said, \"He would try to spread the rumor Jim's not really dead.\"",
      "Why? \"He loved the mythology,\" Densmore replied.",
      "\"He lived for The Doors,\" said Krieger. \"I mean, that was his whole life, you know? And he didn't want it to be over.\"",
      "Manzarek died in 2013.",
      "The band's 60th anniversary is celebrated in a new book \"Night Divides the Day.\"",
      "To the end, The Doors were an improvisational group. One of their best-known songs grew out of another tune they were jamming on in a session. \"We were goofing around,\" said Densmore, and \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" morphed into \"Riders on the Storm.\" It would be Morrison's final recording.",
      "At the Whisky a Go Go every month, Krieger (now 79) has been playing a Doors album in its entirety. Densmore (80) recently sat in on drums.",

The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor Derek Dixon, alleges Perry used his influence in the entertainment industry to prevent Dixon from speaking out until now.",

      "\"Mr. Perry took his success and power and used his considerable influence in the entertainment industry to create a coercive, sexually exploitative dynamic with Mr. Dixon\u2014initially promising him career advancement and creative opportunities, such as producing his pilot and casting him in his show, only to subject him to escalating sexual harassment, assault and battery, and professional retaliation when Mr. Dixon did not reciprocate Mr. Perry's unwanted advances,\" the lawsuit alleges.",

      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",

      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 07:46:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to rescind the \"roadless rule\" that impedes logging on 59 million acres of national forests, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\"Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\" Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oil-price-prices-iran-military-strike-crude-gasoline-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:46:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",
      "What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices?",
      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

      "Miami International officials told CBS News Miami this weekend that the last JetBlue flight is scheduled for September 3.",
      "The airport is not a key hub for JetBlue. The airline operates only a single route into Miami International, offering one to two daily flights between the city and Boston's Logan International Airport, according to JetBlue spokesperson Derek Dombrowski. JetBlue serves over three dozen cities in the U.S., according to its route\u00a0map.",
      "For passengers heading to South Florida, JetBlue will continue to operate out of nearby Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport. The latter, roughly 25 miles north of Miami, offered 70 daily flights to over 30 destinations as of April of this year.",
      "JetBlue will also suspend its year-round service between Boston and Seattle starting October 25, offering flights between the two cities solely during the summer season, according to Dombrowski.",
      "The shift in services align with changes outlined by JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty in an internal memo shared with CBS News last week. In it, Geraghty said the company would \"wind down underperforming routes\" as part of a larger effort to reduce costs amid softening demand for travel.",
      "\"We're hopeful demand and bookings will rebound, but even a recovery won't fully offset the ground we've lost this year, and our path back to profitability will take longer than we'd hoped,\" she said in the memo. \"That means we're still relying on borrowed cash to keep the airline running.\"",
      "The decision to terminate service at Miami International comes four years after JetBlue added the airport to its network. At its peak, the airline was operating as many as 14 daily flights to and from Miami International, according to the Miami Herald.",
      "JetBlue customers with flights booked to or from Miami after September 3 will be contacted and offered alternative travel options via Fort Lauderdale or a full refund, according to Dombrowski.",

      "Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies\u00a0said\u00a0they were entering a \"long-term collaboration\" to make obesity treatment more accessible.",
      "Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement.",
      "Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using \"knock-off, compounded versions\" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug.",
      "This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices.",
      "\"After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,\" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration.\"",
      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF.",

    "summary": "Real estate company Compass claims Zillow is illegally undermining competition by banning property listings if they don't appear on Zillow within 24 hours.",
    "story": [
      "Real estate giant Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule that bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow.",
      "Zillow's rule, announced by the company in April, took effect on May 28, with the company saying that the new standard is necessary to ensure that listings are \"marketed to every buyer\" to give house-hunters \"fair access to listings without having to get access behind a velvet rope controlled by any one company.\"",
      "But Compass, which seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites, is alleging that what it calls the \"Zillow ban\" violates federal antitrust laws. The real estate company claims that ZIllow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"This lawsuit is about protecting consumer choice,\" Compass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a statement. \"No one company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model.\"",
      "He added, \"That's not competition. It's coercion. Imagine if Amazon banned a seller for offering a product on their own website first. That's what Zillow is doing in real estate. Consumers should have the right to choose how they sell their homes.\"",
      "Compass said it has hired Ken Dintzer, a partner in the antitrust division of law firm Crowell & Moring who led the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Google, to represent it in the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a Zillow spokesperson said Compass' claims \"are unfounded\" and that it will fight the lawsuit.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"At the heart of this issue is a simple principle: When a listing is publicly marketed, it should be accessible to all buyers \u2014 across all platforms, including Zillow. Hiding listings creates a fragmented market, limits consumer choice and creates barriers to homeownership, which is bad for buyers, sellers and the industry at large, especially in this inventory and affordability-constrained environment.\"",
      "Private exclusives",
      "With the lawsuit, Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers. The first step in the strategy is a \"private exclusive\" listing that is available on Compass' internal platform, which allows its agents to share information about the home with possible buyers.",
      "The second step involves a \"coming soon\" listing on Compass's website, available to anyone who searches online for properties. The third element involves moving the listing to multiple listing services, or MLS, and onto aggregation sites like Zillow.",
      "\"For Zillow, every home buyer search conducted on Compass instead of Zillow is a lost opportunity for Zillow to lock that prospective home buyer into Zillow's ecosystem and make money selling her information to real estate agents for a lead fee \u2014 Zillow's central business model,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The complaint alleges that \"Zillow doesn't like the 3-phased marketing strategy because Zillow can't make money selling leads off listings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 where they don't have the listings.\"",
      "Compass, which has more than 33,000 real estate agents, said that almost half of all sellers who signed with them relied on its three-step listing strategy in the first quarter.",
      "\"In a free and competitive market, competitors' products and strategies should rise and fall on merit \u2014 not the whims of a monopolist gatekeeper like Zillow,\" Compass claims in the suit.",

      "Tesla did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's email seeking information about the launch. However, details shared on social media and past comments from Musk offer some clues as to what it will look like.",
      "Where will the robotaxi event take place?",
      "The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a \"geofenced area\" in Austin. In a CNBC interview in\u00a0May, Musk suggested there could be around 10 robotaxis in circulation during the pilot in Austin, and said Tesla would scale up the number from there.",
      "According to a note from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives, there could be up to 20 Model Y cars circling around Austin on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear how many people were invited to participate in the pilot, although it appears \"Early Access\" invites went primarily to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. In a copy of the\u00a0invitation\u00a0shared on social media, it says these riders will be \"among the first to use our new Robotaxi App\" and that they will be able to provide \"valuable feedback.\"",
      "Those invited to Austin's pilot can hail the self-driving cars via the Robotaxi App and go anywhere except the airport from 6 a.m. to midnight on Sunday, the invitation says.",
      "What has Elon Musk said about robotaxis?",
      "Musk previewed the launch in January during an earnings call, saying the cars will be \"in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin.\" A\u00a0video posted by the company that same month offers a glimpse of the interiors and exteriors of Tesla's autonomous vehicles.",
      "The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. With Tesla's sales tumbling amid widespread protests against his government work, some Tesla investors had asked him\u00a0to refocus on the EV carmaker.",
      "In an X post from earlier this month, Musk\u00a0teased the June 22 launch date and said the first driverless trip \"from factory end of line all the way to a customer house\" is set to take place on June 28.",
      "From there, he has said he expects services to scale rapidly. It's likely that the Tesla robotaxi could be rolled out in 25 U.S. cities over the next year, according to Ives.",
      "Are there safety concerns about robotaxis?",
      "Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from the government officials and independent groups like the Dawn Project, a computer safety advocacy company, which argues that Tesla's self-driving technology puts children in harm's way.",
      "Tesla is also under the microscope of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\u00a0launched an investigation in October\u00a0after four vehicles with Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system were involved in crashes.",
      "In May, the agency's investigatory arm shifted its focus to the impending pilot program in Austin, saying in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that it wants information from Tesla on how it plans to evaluate its fleet of robotaxis for use on public roads.",
      "These concerns seems to have caught the attention of Musk, who earlier this month wrote, \"We are being super paranoid about safety\" in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0discussing the rollout.",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers from Texas signed a letter asking Tesla to delay its launch until September 1, when a new law regulating the safety of autonomous vehicles takes effect. Under the laws new framework, commercial vehicles would be required to get authorization for the Department of Motor Vehicles \"before operating on public streets without a human driver.\"",
      "It's unlikely that will hobble this weekend's launch, which appears to be moving ahead, albeit with certain safety provisions built in. According to the invite\u00a0shared on social media, the robotaxis in Austin pilot will have a \"Tesla Safety Monitor\" in the front right passenger seat. Remote monitors will also be keeping track of the rides, according to\u00a0CNBC.",
      "How important are robotaxis for Tesla?",
      "The rollout of the robotaxi service, if successful, could help boost the company's fortunes after it faced intense backlash over Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE, noted Wedbush's Ives.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with its profit tumbling 71% and its sales sliding 9% during the three-month period. While its stock has regained some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla, it's still 33% below its December peak of about $480 per share.",
      "The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to Ives.",
      "\"The golden era of autonomous for Tesla officially kicks off on Sunday in Austin,\" Ives wrote in a research report. \"We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla.\"",
      "In ramping up robotaxi service, Tesla is hoping to slingshot past Waymo, another autonomous car service that operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, according to its\u00a0website. Last week, Waymo\u00a0applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City.",
      "\"I don't really think about competitors. I just think about making the product as perfect as possible,\" Musk has said of his robotaxi venture.",
      "Either way, Tesla will have some catching up to do. Waymo currently gets 250,000 paid trips each week for its driverless taxis service.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:31:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump entertained the idea of firing Jerome Powell on Friday, a legally untested and contentious move.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Friday he may try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling the central bank leader a \"Total and Complete Moron\" for leaving interest rates steady.",
      "The president has been lashing out against Powell for months, criticizing the central banker \u2014 whom Mr. Trump appointed in his first term \u2014 for not lowering interest rates at a faster pace. It's unclear whether the president is legally allowed to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026, and Mr. Trump said in April he has \"no intention\" of doing so.",
      "But in a post criticizing Powell on Friday, Mr. Trump floated the idea, writing: \"Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?\"",
      "\"But regardless, his Term ends shortly!\" the president added.",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell would be legally contentious. Federal law and prior court precedent says members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including the chair, can only be fired \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration can fire members of other independent federal agencies \u2014 but specifically exempted the Fed, calling the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Powell said last year he will not resign if Mr. Trump asks him to step down. The two met at the White House last month.",
      "Mr. Trump also called Powell a \"dumb guy\" in his Friday evening post.",
      "\"I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering Rates, but I've tried it all different ways,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I've been nice, I've been neutral, and I've been nasty, and nice and neutral didn't work! He's a dumb guy, and an obvious Trump Hater, who should have never been there.\"",
      "The Fed declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Why has Trump criticized Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump's issues with Powell hinge on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The central bank's interest rate-setting committee, which is chaired by Powell, has kept its benchmark rate steady so far this year, after lowering it slightly from a two-decade high last year \u2014 following a series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation.",
      "Most recently, the committee opted against lowering rates earlier this week, drawing backlash from Mr. Trump.",
      "The decision comes with tradeoffs. High interest rates can slow down economic growth and make it more expensive for Americans to borrow money, which is why Mr. Trump wants cuts. But lowering interest rates too quickly could overheat the economy and cause inflation to spike yet again. While inflation has cooled off in recent years, it's still higher than the Fed's 2% annual target, and the Fed warns Mr. Trump's tariffs could push prices up.",
      "\"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" Powell said earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump disagrees, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing that inflation is already low.",
      "On Friday, the president amped up his criticism, calling Powell a \"numbskull\" and suggesting the other members of the rate-setting Federal Open Monetary Committee \"override\" him. Mr. Trump also said Powell should lower interest rates immediately and just hike them again if inflation spikes \u2014 an idea that's at odds with the Fed's cautious strategy.",
      "\"Don't say that you think there will be Inflation sometime in the future, because there isn't now but, if there is, raise the Rates!\" wrote Mr. Trump.",
      "The attacks are a redux of Mr. Trump's first-term criticism. The president pushed back against Powell after the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, but called Powell his \"most improved player\" for slashing rates during the 2020 pandemic.",

      "Durov didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I want them to live like normal people, to build themselves up alone, to learn to trust themselves, to be able to create, not to be dependent on a bank account,\" he told the publication.",
      "Durov, who is 40, added that he has six children who were conceived naturally with three different partners, plus at least another 100, whom he's fathered through sperm donations.",
      "\"The clinic, where I started donating sperm 15 years ago to help a friend, told me that more than 100 babies had been conceived this way in 12 countries,\" he told Le Point.",
      "Durov made clear that his children \"will all have the same rights.\"",
      "Based on his current net worth and assuming he has 106 children, each of his offspring would inherit about $131 million.",
      "\"I don't want them to tear each other apart after my death,\" he said in the interview.",
      "Durov added in the interview that he follows a rigorous daily workout regimen that includes 300 push-ups followed by 300 squats. He said he doesn't consume alcohol, coffee or tea, avoids sugar and is not a smoker.",
      "French authorities have charged Durov, alleging Telegram is used for criminal purposes, including the propagation of child sexual abuse material and for drug trafficking. Durov has denied the charges.",
      "He told Le Point that he believes the charges are \"absurd.\"",
      "\"Just because criminals use our messaging service among many others doesn't make those who run it criminals,\" he told the magazine.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-airlines-us-the-points-guy/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "This was the number one airline in the U.S. last year, based on its reliability, passenger experience and more.",
    "story": [
      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-deportation-efforts-could-impact-these-industries-and-states-that-rely-on-undocumented-workers/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Unauthorized immigrants make up nearly 5% of the U.S. workforce, according to 2022 estimates, and a higher share in construction and agriculture.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration resumed more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

      "President Trump on Tuesday heads to a whirlwind NATO summit at the Hague, Netherlands, hours after he announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that \"the ceasefire is in effect.\"",
      "The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was \"on track\" to make that \"historic commitment\" of 5%.",
      "The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target.",
      "\"We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,\" he told reporters Friday. \"So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely.\"",

      "\"Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,\" Whitaker said, adding, \"I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies.\"",
      "He said that the U.S. is \"calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,\" and he went on to say that the U.S. is \"engaged at the highest levels\" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Shortly before the summit, on Saturday, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting\u00a0three Iranian sites\u00a0believed to be key to\u00a0Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was limited.\u00a0Iran fired\u00a0more than a dozen missiles at a\u00a0U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump called the retaliatory strikes \"very weak,\" and he said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\" Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also pointed out in a social media post after the Iranian strikes, \"We didn't harm anyone.\"",
      "Within hours, Mr. Trump made the announcement that Iran and Israel would implement a ceasefire and shortly bring the war to an end.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roadless-rule-national-forests-logging-reversal/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 07:46:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to rescind the \"roadless rule\" that impedes logging on 59 million acres of national forests, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\"Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\" Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\" Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home of the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Mr. Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Mr. Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The Tongass is a temperate rainforest of glaciers and rugged coastal islands. It provides habitat to wildlife such as bears, wolves, salmon and bald eagles.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are meeting Tuesday to elect a new ranking member following the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly last month.",
      "Though Democrats are currently in the minority, the new ranking member would be in line to chair the Oversight Committee if Democrats retake the House in 2026, halfway through President Trump's second term. During Mr. Trump's first term, the committee led numerous investigations into the Trump administration after Democrats won the House in 2018.",
      "Connolly's death\u00a0came weeks after the Virginia Democrat announced that he would not seek reelection in 2026 and would be\u00a0stepping back\u00a0from his post as the top Democrat on the committee because his cancer had returned. He was 75 years old.",
      "Connolly had been elected to the top committee post months earlier, as the committee's members rejected a push by some to tap a younger generation of lawmakers to lead the party on top panels. Connolly defeated 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to become the ranking member of the powerful committee.",
      "Oversight Committee Democrats have vied for the ranking member post since Connolly announced his departure from the role. And though Ocasio-Cortez opted not to seek the post, having left the committee months earlier, the contest quickly became crowded.",
      "Four Democrats are seeking the top post \u2014 Reps. Stephen Lynch of of Massachusetts, Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California and Jasmine Crockett of Texas.",
      "Lynch, 70, currently serves as the acting ranking member, and Mfume, 76, is high in the committee's ranks. But whether the seniority that typically drives committee leadership races holds in Tuesday's contents remains to be seen. Garcia, 47, currently serves as Democratic Caucus Leadership Representative, and Crockett, 44, is seen as a rising star in the caucus, known for viral moments on the committee.",
      "The selection of a new top Democrat on the committee comes after a shakeup in committee leadership assignments in the party at the beginning of this Congress illustrated tensions over a potential generational shift. Long-serving top Democrats on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees stepped away from the top spots amid challenges from younger Democrats as the party prepared to counter Republican efforts with a GOP trifecta in Washington.",

      "Update: This story was published before President Trump, on Tuesday morning, accused both Israel and Iran of violating the ceasefire he had announced just hours earlier. Then, after speaking with Israel's prime minister, Mr. Trump said Israel would not continue attacking Iran and declared, \"the Ceasefire is in effect.\"\u00a0Read more here.",
      "Israel and Iran said Tuesday they are complying with a ceasefire agreement announced by President Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said on Truth Social just after 1 a.m. ET Tuesday that a ceasefire he announced earlier between the two countries \"IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!\"",
      "The Israeli government announced that, \"In light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire. Israel will respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "At about the same time, Iranian state television said the ceasefire had begun.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed on a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE\", a move he said would end the more than weeklong conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire was to take hold in stages, the president said.",
      "Under the ceasefire announced by Mr. Trump Monday evening, Iran was to stop striking Israel in six hours (at midnight ET on Tuesday), and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that (at noon ET Tuesday). Then, after another 12 hours, or at midnight ET Wednesday, the war would be considered over, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had reported a series of missile barrages from Iran both before and after Mr. Trump's midnight deadline for Iran to halt the strikes. Israel did not specify when the missiles were launched, and it's unclear whether the latest missile strikes violated the terms laid out by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hours after Mr. Trump's initial post, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested on X that Iran had stopped its strikes on Israel at 4 a.m. Tehran time (8:30 p.m. ET Monday). Iran's military operations \"continued until the very last minute,\" he wrote.",
      "But Araghchi also wrote that \"there is NO 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,\" though he added that Iran didn't plan to continue strikes on Israel if Israel also ceased strikes at the same time. The timeline laid out by Mr. Trump called for Israel to stop striking about 15 hours after the time specified by Araghchi.",
      "\"The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,\" Araghchi wrote.",
      "In another Truth Social post later Monday night, following the Iranian foreign minister's comments, Mr. Trump wrote, in part, that Israel and Iran \"came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, 'PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW.\"",
      "Prior to Araghchi's comments, a senior White House official told CBS News both sides had agreed to a ceasefire, with Israel agreeing as long as there are no further Iranian strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while several other administration officials \u2014 Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 communicated with Iran through direct and indirect channels, the White House official said.",
      "Qatar helped broker a deal, another White House official said. Mr. Trump had asked the Qatari Emir to get Iran to agree to a ceasefire. Vance coordinated with the Qatari prime minister on details, and Iran agreed to the ceasefire after speaking to the prime minister. The official said the direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13 with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "At least 950 people have been killed and 3,450 wounded in Israel's strikes in Iran, including a mix of military personnel and civilians, the group Human Rights Activists told the\u00a0Associated Press. Iran's attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Dispute over Iran's nuclear program still lingers",
      "It's not clear how the ceasefire announcement will impact a broader dispute over the fate of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Israel's campaign was primarily aimed at Iran's nuclear program, as the country's stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium has grown rapidly in recent months, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "Israel has alleged Iran was secretly \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" But earlier this year, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was not making nuclear weapons, though \"pressure has probably built\" for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reauthorize the country's nuclear weapons program.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" about Iran's nuclear ambitions, telling reporters, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant\" in an interview Sunday\u00a0on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying Iranian officials \"have everything they need to build the weapon.\"",
      "Iran has long insisted its uranium enrichment program is peaceful.",
      "For weeks, Mr. Trump has sought a broader deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, but even before Israel began striking Iran, administration officials had grown frustrated with what they viewed as Iran's unwillingness to actually negotiate, a U.S. official told CBS News. Mr. Trump has suggested Iran should abandon all uranium enrichment, but Iran rejected that demand.",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend the U.S.'s strikes had \"obliterated\" three Iranian nuclear sites, including two subterranean uranium enrichment facilities, though Iran has downplayed the damage.",

      "Officials in Tallahassee first announced plans to help the federal government expand its capacity to hold detainees awaiting deportation last week.",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said a largely abandoned airfield in the Everglades would be repurposed as a detention facility to house immigrants living in the U.S. illegally with criminal records. He dubbed it \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" saying any detainees seeking to escape would face alligators and pythons in the treacherous wetlands surrounding the site.",
      "On Monday, Uthmeier announced the federal government had \"approved\" the state's plan to build \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and other facilities that he said could collectively house as many as 5,000 detainees. He said the facilities could start receiving detainees early next month, calling them temporary.",
      "\"There's really nowhere to go. If you're housed there, if you're detained there, there's no way in, no way out,\" Uthmeier said in an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, describing the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" facility.",

And without this court's intervention, Florida and its citizens will remain disabled from combatting the serious harms of illegal immigration for years as this litigation proceeds through the lower courts.\"",
      "Williams had initially issued a temporary restraining order that prohibited enforcement of the immigration law and ordered the attorney general to notify all law enforcement agencies in the state of her injunction. Uthmeier circulated a letter to those agencies in April informing them that officers and agents should comply with Williams' directives.

      "Red River Radio General Manager Kermit Poling said the network gets about $160,000 each year from the government. It's about 15% of their $1 million budget.",
      "\"It's kind of like any nonprofit. You're always in one form or another asking for donations,\" Poling said.",
      "The federal money that Red River Radio receives is part of the $1.1 billion total in proposed cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds to NPR and PBS. NPR and three local stations have joined a lawsuit against the Trump administration over these cuts. A rescissions package to claw back funding for NPR, PBS and international aid\u00a0approved by the House\u00a0earlier this month is now headed to the Senate.",
      "The cuts to public broadcasting have been touted by the Trump administration and Republicans as an effort to slash taxpayer funding for news media outlets they accuse of being \"liberal\" or politically biased in their content. But according to a congressional report obtained by CBS News from Senate Democrats, approximately 60% of the hundreds of radio and television stations that could suffer funding cuts are in Trump-won states.",
      "Rural broadcasters have a harder time raising private funds, and it makes them more vulnerable to the proposed federal funding cuts, the co-chairs of the Public Broadcasting Caucus said earlier this month.",
      "\"Public broadcasting represents less than 0.01% of the federal budget, yet its impact reaches every congressional district,\" Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei and New York Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman said in a joint statement. \"Cutting this funding will not meaningfully reduce the deficit, but it will dismantle a trusted source of information for millions of Americans.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend sparked bipartisan efforts to force a vote to reassert Congress' power to declare war, though House Speaker Mike Johnson says the push is now irrelevant because Mr. Trump announced Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "\"It's kind of a moot point now, isn't it?\" the Louisiana Republican said Monday evening. \"It seems rather silly at this point and I hope they'll acknowledge it as such and put it to bed because it has zero chance of passing anyway.\"",
      "Israel and Iran have not commented on Mr. Trump's ceasefire announcement.",
      "As Mr. Trump last week weighed whether to use direct military force against Iran, a bipartisan contingent of lawmakers demanded that the president seek congressional approval before moving forward with any action.",
      "Several war powers resolutions were introduced in both chambers before Saturday's strikes to prevent the U.S. from becoming involved in the war between Iran and Israel. The resolutions would require Congress to authorize force against Iran, preventing the president from taking unilateral action. Lawmakers backing the resolutions have emphasized that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution.",
      "Following the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, called on Congress to reconvene immediately to vote on their war powers resolution, which has dozens of cosponsors.",
      "House members across the political spectrum, from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have come out against a conflict with Iran, indicating that the resolution could have broad support and pass.",
      "But Johnson indicated earlier Monday that it might not get a vote, telling reporters that it's not the \"appropriate time\" for a war powers resolution.",
      "\"For 80 years, presidents of both parties have acted with the same commander-in-chief authority under Article Two,\" Johnson said. \"The president made an evaluation that the danger was imminent enough to take his authority as commander in chief and make that decision.\"",
      "Massie said he would not force a vote on the resolution if the ceasefire holds and the U.S. is not engaged in \"hostilities\" toward Iran.",
      "\"Then it's a moot point,\" he said, calling the situation \"wait and see.\"",
      "Meanwhile, top Democrats in Congress said they were still in the dark about Mr. Trump's decision to\u00a0bomb three nuclear sites\u00a0in Iran Saturday, even as Iran\u00a0launched retaliatory strikes\u00a0Monday.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Monday afternoon that he still hasn't been briefed by the White House. Jeffries received a brief call shortly before Mr. Trump announced the strikes to the public on Saturday, according to a source familiar with the call.",
      "Jeffries told reporters the notification was a \"courtesy call with no explanation as to the rationale\" for the U.S. military involvement in Iran and accused the president of potentially misleading the public.",
      "He wants to know, \"What is the administration hiding?\" And Jeffries added that he has asked the administration to brief congressional leaders and the top Democrats and Republicans on the intelligence committees on the escalating conflict. \"It has yet to occur, and it's not clear to me what the administration is hiding from the Congress and from the American people.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he received a similar notification \"without any details\" before the strikes on Iran.",
      "In a statement Monday after Iran retaliated, Schumer said he's asked the Trump administration to give him a classified briefing on \"the full threat picture, the intelligence behind Iran's retaliation, and the details, scope and timeline of any U.S. response.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration should not make the same mistake it made this weekend by launching strikes without giving any details to Congress,\" Schumer said.",
      "Jeffries also said he was not briefed earlier Monday before Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar.",
      "But Johnson said he had received a classified briefing on the situation Monday morning.",
      "\"The retaliation was expected,\" Johnson told reporters.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to brief all House and Senate lawmakers on the situation on Tuesday.",
      "Jeffries said the administration has not presented Congress with any evidence that Iran posed an imminent threat requiring immediate military action.",
      "\"What was the imminent threat to the United States of America?\" Jeffries said. \"There's been no evidence to present an imminent threat.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to pause a judge's order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without first providing them due process.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a lower court order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to countries that are not their places of origin without first giving them the chance to raise fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "The order from the high court is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced recent setbacks from the justices in its efforts to swiftly deport migrants as part of its crackdown on immigration. The Supreme Court's order clears the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision Monday regarding third country removals.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Sotomayor accused the federal government of \"flagrantly unlawful conduct\" and called the majority's decision to intervene at this stage in the case \"inexcusable.\"",
      "\"The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,\" she wrote, joined by Kagan and Jackson.",
      "Sotomayor said that the court is \"rewarding lawlessness\" with a decision that will undermine the foundational principle of due process.",
      "\"Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,\" Sotomayor said. \"That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security called the Supreme Court ruling \"a victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "\"DHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,\" the statement read in part. \"Fire up the deportation planes.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's latest order came in a court fight over the Trump administration's efforts to swiftly deport some migrants to third countries, or countries other than the ones designated on an order of removal. As part of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and plans for mass deportations, his administration has approached nations like Costa Rica, Panama and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "The administration has also already entered into an arrangement with the government of El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants who it claims are gang members, though a \"60 Minutes\" investigation found most have no apparent criminal records. The migrants have been confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, often under a 1798 wartime law.",
      "The Supreme Court previously said in a\u00a0pair\u00a0of\u00a0decisions\u00a0arising from other emergency appeals that migrants facing deportation under that wartime law must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",
      "Four migrants from Latin America filed a broader lawsuit in March on behalf of a nationwide class of all people potentially subject to third-country removals and argued they are entitled to notice and an opportunity to contest their removals on the grounds they fear persecution, torture and death.",
      "In the weeks after the suit was filed, administration officials were engaged in a simmering showdown with a Boston-based federal judge, who in April found that the government had violated migrants' due process rights and blocked immigration authorities from quickly removing them to third countries unless certain steps are first taken.",
      "The judge, Brian Murphy, said the government first had to give the affected migrants written notice of the third country to which they may be deported and a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise fears of torture, persecution or death in that country.",
      "Third-country deportations challenged in court",
      "Since Murphy issued his nationwide injunction in April, immigration lawyers have notified him that a group of migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared to be deported to Libya and Saudi Arabia, though the deportation flights do not appear to have happened. Murphy then concluded last month that the Trump administration violated his order when it attempted to swiftly deport a group of men with criminal histories to war-torn South Sudan with less than 24 hours notice and no chance for them to raise fear-based claims.",
      "South Sudan endured a bloody years-long civil war shortly after gaining independence in 2011, and the United Nations\u00a0warns\u00a0violence has escalated in recent months. The State Department has\u00a0warned\u00a0Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.",
      "Murphy halted the deportations to South Sudan, and the men are being held at a U.S. naval base in nearby Djibouti, a small country on the Horn of Africa. The judge said federal immigration authorities must give six of the deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews to determine whether they are at risk of persecution or torture.",
      "Murphy left it up to the Department of Homeland Security to either conduct the interviews within the U.S. or abroad, but said the department had to retain \"custody and control\" over the men.",
      "A U.S. immigration official revealed in a June 4 filing that the migrants are being held in a conference room in a converted shipping container on the naval base and are guarded by 11 ICE officers. The official, Mellissa Harper, described in an affidavit the conditions facing the migrants and the immigration authorities, who she said have felt ill since arriving in Djibouti, which uses burn pits to dispose of trash and human waste.",
      "The ICE officers were unable to take anti-malaria medication for up to 72 hours before arriving in Djibouti and have experienced coughing, difficulty breathing, fever and achy joint, Harper said. They were also warned by defense officials that they were in \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen, and the ICE officers do not have body armor or other gear to put on in case of an attack, she said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to pause Murphy's injunction, which Solicitor General D. John Sauer said was thwarting the administration's attempts to deport what it describes as the \"worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" he wrote in a filing. \"In addition to usurping the executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "He said Murphy's injunction created a \"diplomatic and logistical morass.\"",
      "But lawyers for the migrants at risk of deportation to third countries said the criteria laid out in the lower court's injunction are mandated by federal law and regulations, U.S. treaty obligations and the Constitution.",
      "The order, they said, \"simply requires defendants to comply with the law when carrying them out.\"",
      "The immigration lawyers said over the past weeks, the Trump administration \"repeatedly sought to remove people as a punitive measure, to some of the most dangerous places on the planet, and with only hours' notice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping immigration crackdown since he returned to the White House for a second term. The president's administration has since moved to end a Temporary Protected Status program that shielded 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation and to revoke the legal status of roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed him to move forward with terminating both of those programs while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Mr. Trump also has sought to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, though several courts have ruled that the president cannot use the law to detain or remove certain migrants.",

      "The bulletin, first obtained by CBS News on Sunday morning, June 22, does not note any current specific threats, but warns that \"low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against US networks.\"",
      "While there are no known threats, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said, \"It is our duty to keep the nation safe and informed, especially during times of conflict.\"",
      "\"The ongoing Israel-Iran conflict brings the possibility of increased threat to the homeland in the form of possible cyberattacks, acts of violence, and antisemitic hate crimes,\" Noem said in a statement Sunday.",
      "The bulletin notes that U.S. law enforcement \"has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020,\" and warns \"the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could also motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets.\"",
      "The bulletin also warns, \"The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against the United States.\"",
      "The bulletin, which has now been officially shared with the public by the Department of Homeland Security, is the type of comprehensive threat assessment designed to communicate information directly to the public about threats and about \"resources for how to stay safe during the heightened threat environment.\"",
      "Multiple sources tell CBS News that intelligence analysts began crafting this document earlier this month. It's gone through many iterations, with plans to publish following any escalation in the conflict overseas or intervention by the United States.",
      "It comes after the U.S. launched military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday evening, an operation that President Trump said aimed to stop \"the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror.\" The president warned Iran not to retaliate and to work toward a peace deal in its war with Israel. Speaking at the White House Saturday night, Mr. Trump threatened to target other Iranian sites \"if peace does not come quickly.\"",
      "Iran had previously vowed to retaliate if the U.S. joined Israel's attack, which started June 13 with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets. More than 650 people have been killed and at least 2,000 have been wounded in Iran since then, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group. At least 24 have also been killed in Israel, and hundreds wounded, in Iran's retaliatory missile and drone strikes, according to estimates from the Israeli military. The conflict has played out as Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza continues.",
      "\"The Iranian Government has declared the United States complicit for Israel's attack, and will almost certainly condemn direct US involvement in the conflict,\" said U.S. officials in Sunday's bulletin.",
      "They additionally cautioned that the Israel-Iran conflict \"could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks,\" citing violent incidents in recent months targeting Jewish groups and institutions around the country. Federal law enforcement agencies had already issued an intelligence bulletin in early June warning that those attacks could motivate others.",
      "Law enforcement officials in New York City said Saturday night that they were \"deploying additional resources\" to certain sites as a precaution. The NYPD tweeted: \"We're tracking the situation unfolding in Iran. Out of an abundance of caution, we're deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC and coordinating with our federal partners. We'll continue to monitor for any potential impact to NYC.\"",
      "In addition to the domestic security bulletin, the U.S. State Department issued a worldwide alert for all Americans traveling or planning to travel outside the country, noting that in light of the strikes on Iran, \"there is the potential for demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad. The Department of State advises U.S. citizens worldwide to exercise increased caution.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider a religious rights case brought by a former Louisiana inmate who is seeking to sue Louisiana prison officials for money damages for shaving his dreadlocks in violation of his religious beliefs.",
      "The high court will review a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that said the former inmate, Damon Landor, could not seek monetary damages against the officials in their individual capacities under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA.",
      "Landor is a devout Rastafarian who pledged to \"let the locks of the hair of his head grow,\" known as the Nazarite Vow. Landor upheld that pledge for nearly 20 years, until he was nearly finished with a five-month prison sentence in Louisiana.",
      "For the first four months of his incarceration, the two facilities where Landor was housed allowed him to keep his hair long or under a \"rastacap.\" But that changed after Landor was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center for the final three weeks of his sentence. Once there, Landor told an intake guard that he was a practicing Rastafarian and handed over proof of his religious accommodations, as well as a copy of a 2017 decision from the 5th Circuit that found Louisiana's policy of cutting Rastafarians' hair violated RLUIPA, according to court filings.",
      "But two guards ultimately handcuffed Landor to a chair, held him down and had his head shaved, according to papers filed with the Supreme Court.",
      "Landor filed a lawsuit against the prison officials after he was released and brought numerous claims, including under the RLUIPA. But a federal judge agreed to dismiss the case, finding that the law does not allow for damages against individual state officials.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the 5th Circuit affirmed that decision, ruling that while it \"emphatically\" condemned Landor's treatment, a prior decision in the circuit required it to hold that he could not seek money damages from officials in their individual capacities for violations of RLUIPA.",
      "The full 5th Circuit refused to reconsider the case, with 11 judges voting not to rehear it and six voting in favor.",
      "The case follows a Supreme Court decision from December 2020 in which it unanimously held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RLUIPA's sister statute, allows litigants to obtain money damages against federal officials in their individual capacities.",
      "Lawyers for Landor argued that Congress enacted the two laws to provide meaningful protection for religious liberty, and denying litigants the opportunity to seek damages for violations of RLUIPA would render that promise empty.",
      "Louisiana officials said in court papers that the allegations raised in Landor's appeal are \"antithetical to religious freedom and fair treatment of state prisoners,\" and condemned them \"in the strongest possible terms.\" But they urged the Supreme Court to turn away his appeal and said the state amended its prison grooming policy to prevent other inmates from being treated as Landor was.",

    "summary": "ICE officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran in Louisiana during a routine immigration appointment.",
    "story": [
      "After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre's wife last month, he doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Jun 2025 09:57:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The judge acknowledged in her ruling that determining whether Abrego Garcia should be released is \"little more than an academic exercise\" because ICE will likely detain him.",
    "story": [
      "A Tennessee judge on Sunday ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown, while he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges. But he is not expected to be allowed to go free.",
      "At his June 13 detention hearing, prosecutors said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would take Abrego Garcia into custody if he were released on the criminal charges, and he could be deported before he has a chance to stand trial.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to discuss the conditions of Abrego Garcia's release. The U.S. government has already filed a motion to appeal the judge's release order.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Monday that Abrego Garcia \"will never go free on American soil.\"",
      "Holmes acknowledged in her ruling Sunday that determining whether Abrego Garcia should be released is \"little more than an academic exercise\" because ICE will likely detain him. But the judge wrote that everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence and \"a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial.\"",
      "Holmes wrote that the government failed to prove that Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, that he posed a danger to the community or that he would interfere with proceedings if released.",
      "\"Overall, the Court cannot find from the evidence presented that Abrego Garcia's\u00a0release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges that his attorneys have characterized as an attempt to justify the deportation mistake after the fact.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, Rob McGuire, argued on June 13 that the likely attempt by ICE to try to deport him was one reason to keep him in jail.",
      "But Holmes said then that she had no intention of \"getting in the middle of any ICE hold.\"",
      "\"If I elect to release Mr. Abrego, I will impose conditions of release, and the U.S. Marshal will release him.\" If he is released into ICE custody, that is \"above my pay grade,\" she said.",
      "The judge suggested that the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security could work out between themselves whether the government's priority is to try him on the criminal charges or deport him. No date has been set for the trial.",
      "Will Allensworth, an assistant federal public defender representing Abrego Garcia at the detention hearing, told Holmes that \"it's not necessarily accurate that he would be immediately deported.\"",
      "A 2019 immigration judge's order prevents Abrego Garcia, who had been living in Maryland, from being deported to his home country of El Salvador, Allensworth said in court. That's because he faces a credible threat from gangs there, according to court papers.",
      "The government could deport him to a third country, but immigration officials would first be required to show that third country was willing to keep him and not simply deport him back to El Salvador, Allensworth said.",
      "The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. Although officers suspected possible smuggling, he was allowed to go on his way with only a warning.",
      "At the detention hearing, McGuire said cooperating witnesses have accused Abrego Garcia of trafficking drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims. Although he is not charged with such crimes, McGuire said they showed Abrego Garcia to be a dangerous person who should remain in jail pretrial.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have characterized the smuggling case as a desperate attempt to justify the mistaken deportation. The investigation was launched weeks after the U.S. government deported Abrego Garcia and the Supreme Court ordered the administration to facilitate his return amid mounting public pressure.",
      "Chris Newman, an attorney who represents Abrego Garcia's family, previously told CBS News, \"The Trump administration is very invested in making this a referendum on the immigration debate, which, as you know, has become coarsened and polarized.\"",
      "\"And that is one way to look at it. And I think certainly a lot of people view it that way. I don't view it that way. I view this as a core constitutional order case, a core due process case,\" Newman said. \"And it just so happens that a Salvadoran immigrant is defending bedrock constitutional protections for all of us.\"",
      "Most people in ICE custody who are facing criminal charges are not kept in the U.S. for trial but deported, Ohio State University law professor C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said.",
      "The U.S. will likely try to deport Abrego Garcia quickly without going before an immigration judge, the professor said. The government would not need a conviction to deport him because Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"The legal standard is laxer,\" Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said. \"The government's argument is on stronger legal footing.\"",
      "However an immigration judge rules, the decision can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said. And the board's ruling can then be contested in a federal appeals court.",

      "New satellite photos show the aftermath of the U.S. military strike\u00a0that dropped multiple 30,000-pound \"bunker-buster\" bombs on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility and hit two other key locations in Iran's nuclear program.",
      "The stealth U.S. mission, dubbed \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" struck three nuclear facilities in Iran \u2014 Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan \u2014 in the early hours of Sunday local time.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon briefing Sunday that seven B-2 Spirit bombers each carried two of the bombs known as GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs. Over 25 minutes, a total of 14 MOPs were dropped on two target areas at Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk missiles from a U.S. submarine targeted the Isfahan site, he said.",
      "He said it was the first time those massive bombs have ever been used in an operation.",
      "\"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.",
      "Satellite photos show impact of strikes on Fordo",
      "Satellite images from Maxar Technologies, taken Sunday after the strikes, show damage to the mountainside where the underground nuclear site at Fordo is buried about 300 feet down. They can be compared to images of the same location taken before the strikes.",
      "A layer of ash caused by the airstrikes can be seen across a large swath of the area.",
      "The images by Maxar show several large diameter holes or craters on the top of the ridge over the underground complex.",
      "Additionally, several of the tunnel entrances that lead to the underground facility appear blocked by dirt following the strikes.",
      "Asked at the briefing whether any of Iran's nuclear capability remains, Caine said, \"I think (battle damage assessment) is still pending, and it would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there.\"",
      "Iran has yet to offer a damage assessment of the site. The United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post that it had seen \"no increase in off-site radiation levels\" in the wake of the U.S. strikes.",
      "In a statement on Sunday to the U.N. Security Council, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said his team was unable to assess the underground damage at Fordo. Following the attacks, he said there's a \"window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy.\"",
      "\"If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall,\" Grossi said.",
      "Craters, destroyed buildings in Isfahan and Natanz",
      "At Isfahan, which was targeted by about a dozen Tomahawk missiles, satellite images from Sunday show extensive building damage across the facility, compared to images taken June 16. The Israeli military had also heavily bombed Isfahan in recent days",
      "Grossi told the UN Security Council that affected buildings include some related to the uranium conversion process. Entrances to tunnels used for the storage of enriched material appear to have been hit, the IAEA director general said.",
      "At the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, a satellite image captured Sunday by Maxar shows an approximately 5.5-meter diameter hole or crater in the dirt directly over part of the underground military complex.",
      "Natanz had been previously damaged by the first Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13.",
      "Grossi confirmed Sunday that the fuel enrichment plant in Natanz had been hit again, with the U.S. confirming that it used ground-penetrating munitions. He said Iran has informed the nuclear watchdog there has been no increase in off-site radiation levels following the attacks. However, bombing nuclear facilities \"could result in radioactive releases with grave consequence,\" Grossi warned, urging \"maximum restraint.\"",
      "U.S. military used decoys and deception in attack",
      "President Trump announced Saturday evening that the U.S. had launched strikes against Iran. He said in a\u00a0national address later Saturday night\u00a0that the sites \"have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Sunday that the U.S. used decoy B-2 bombers, which flew west over the Pacific from their base in Missouri earlier Saturday, to throw off the Iranians from the true plans. The bombers actually involved in the strike took off on an eastward path, refueling several times on their way to the Middle East.",
      "Hegseth added that the U.S. used other methods of deception to protect the B-2 bombers that dropped the 14 \"bunker-buster\" bombs. He said the tactics helped the U.S. drop the bombs without tipping off Iran's fighter jets or its air missile systems.",
      "\"Our B-2s went in and out \u2026 and back without the world knowing at all,\" Hegseth said. \"In that way, it was historic. A strike that included the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001, and the first operational employment of the MOP, a Massive Ordnance Penetrator.\"",

      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Lawmakers across the political aisle offered a mixed response Saturday following President Trump's announcement that the\u00a0United States launched strikes\u00a0on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Immediately following Mr. Trump's announcement, Congressional Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz, backed Mr. Trump's actions, while a number of leading Democrats condemned his decision to launch the attack without consulting Congress.",
      "In a televised address Saturday night, the president described the strikes as a \"spectacular military success\" and said \"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\" He warned of \"far greater\" attacks if Iran does not \"make peace.\"",
      "\"There is not another military in the World that could have done this,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"",
      "Here's what lawmakers are saying:",
      "Many Republican lawmakers back U.S. strikes in Iran, but not all",
      "\"Good. This was the right call. The regime deserves it. Well done, President @realDonaldTrump,\" Sen. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said on X.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a social media post that \"the military operations in Iran should serve as a clear reminder to our adversaries and allies that President Trump means what he says.\"",
      "\"The President gave Iran's leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement,\" Johnson\u00a0said in the post. \"President Trump has been consistent and clear that a nuclear-armed Iran will not be tolerated. That posture has now been enforced with strength, precision, and clarity.\"",
      "Texas Sen. Cruz, who has backed of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets, said in a statement: \"As long as Iran was able to access and conduct activities at Fordow, they could still rush to build a nuclear arsenal. Tonight's actions have gone far in foreclosing that possibility, and countering the apocalyptic threat posed by an Iranian nuclear arsenal.\"",
      "Rep. Rick Crawford, Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Mr. Trump in a statement and said, \"I have been in touch with the White House before this action and will continue to track developments closely with them in the coming days.\"",
      "The strikes announced by Mr. Trump Saturday evening further escalated the conflict between\u00a0Iran and Israel\u00a0that started June 13. Mr. Trump, on Wednesday,\u00a0was still mulling over\u00a0whether the U.S. military would join Israel's ongoing attacks on Iran.",
      "Before the announcement of the strikes, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was among the few Republicans who opposed the U.S. action, arguing on social media, \"This is not our fight.\"",
      "\"Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,\" she said in a post on X. \"There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.\"",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, reshared Mr. Trump's post on the strikes with a terse comment: \"not constitutional.\" Massie\u00a0introduced a resolution on Tuesday to prohibit U.S. involvement in the conflict. A few days earlier, he pointed out that the power to authorize use of military force rests with Congress, and\u00a0said\u00a0of the Israel-Iran conflict on X, \"This is not our war.  But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution.\"",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Massie said his resolution, introduced with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, seeks \"to rein in the executive and reassert Congress's authority, sole authority, to declare war and to- and to engage or authorize the engagement of acts of war.\"",
      "Some Democrats say U.S. strikes in Iran are unconstitutional",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democrats agreed with Massie that the president should have consulted Congress, and on Saturday demanded that lawmakers be \"fully and immediately\" briefed on the attacks in a classified setting.",
      "\"President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also called for Congress to enforce the War Powers Act.",
      "\"President Trump must provide the American people and Congress clear answers on the actions taken tonight and their implications for the safety of Americans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"No president should be allowed to unilaterally march this nation into something as consequential as war with erratic threats and no strategy. Confronting Iran's ruthless campaign of terror, nuclear ambitions, and regional aggression demands strength, resolve, and strategic clarity. The danger of wider, longer, and more devastating war has now dramatically increased.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, vice chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said that while there is \"no question that Iran poses a serious threat to regional stability,\" the president's actions threaten to drag the U.S. into an open-ended conflict \"without consulting Congress\" and \"without a clear strategy.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who cosponsored Massie's resolution seeking to limit Mr. Trump's war powers, said in a statement early Sunday that Congress \"needs to come back to DC immediately to vote\" on the resolution \"to ensure there is no further conflict and escalation.\"",
      "\"Trump's strikes are unconstitutional and put Americans, especially our troops, at risk,\" Khanna said.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation,\" Khanna said \"the procedure should have been that Congress was briefed before we decided to enter war, and that we actually had a vote on it.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts\u00a0called on Congress\u00a0to return to Washington to vote on Massie and Khanna's legislation \"to stop this madness.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has introduced a similar resolution in the Senate, and told \"Face the Nation\" that he was \"so disappointed that the president has acted so prematurely.\"",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called Mr. Trump's decision to bomb Iran without congressional authorization \"is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.\"",
      "\"He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,\" the New York Democrat wrote. \"It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\"",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been trying to limit Mr. Trump's ability to order U.S. strikes on Iran amid its ongoing war with Israel, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution. The extent of the president's authority to enter foreign conflicts without the approval of the legislative branch has been questioned in recent years. The last time Congress authorized the use of military force was in 2002, against Iraq. A year earlier, days after the 9/11 terror attacks, Congress passed a bill approving the use of military force against nations, organizations or individuals the president determines \"planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan urged Democratic colleagues in a post, \"Don't make another mistake in dragging our country into another war,\" and added, \"You can stop the President and the war mongers in Congress by signing on to our War Powers Resolution.\"",
      "In contrast to other Congressional Democrats, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania said he fully supports the U.S. strikes on Iran.",
      "\"As I've long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS,\" Fetterman said in a social media post. \"Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities. I'm grateful for and salute the finest military in the world.\"",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, who's on a tour this weekend in red Southern states, announced the news of the U.S. attacks on Iran to his supporters and was met the chants of \"no more war\" from the crowd.",

      "\"This means that, in 30 short days, this program that has provided life-saving services to more than 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people will no longer be available for those who need it,\" Black said in a statement Wednesday. \"Suicide prevention is about people, not politics. The administration's decision to remove a bipartisan, evidence-based service that has effectively supported a high-risk group of young people through their darkest moments is incomprehensible.\"",
      "The news comes in the middle of Pride Month, which Black called \"callous.\" He also criticized \"the administration's choice to remove the 'T' from the acronym 'LGBTQ+' in their announcement,\" saying, \"Transgender people can never, and will never, be erased.\"",

    "summary": "A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during ramp-up to an expected engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. It's an apparent major setback for the program.",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday.",
      "The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption.",
      "The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV.",
      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",
      "\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known.",
      "NASA counting on Starship for moon mission",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",
      "Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space \u2014 a task never attempted at this scale \u2014 SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space.",
      "No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment.",
      "The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule.",
      "The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission.",
      "\"Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that \"NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

      "Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown.",
      "The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids.",
      "In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects \u2014 all of which pose no threat.",
      "For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year.",
      "Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 17:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during ramp-up to an expected engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. It's an apparent major setback for the program.",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday.",
      "The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption.",
      "The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV.",
      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",
      "\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known.",
      "NASA counting on Starship for moon mission",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",
      "Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space \u2014 a task never attempted at this scale \u2014 SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space.",
      "No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment.",
      "The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule.",
      "The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission.",
      "\"Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that \"NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions.\"",
      "\"We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission.\"",

Solar flares are essentially \"giant explosions on the sun\" that send energy, light and high-speed particles into space, according to NASA.",
      "An image captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory shows the sun, colorized in teal to draw attention to the flare. The flare is visible as a bright flash at the center of the sun. The heat of a solar flare causes it to appear bright.",
      "The energy from solar flares can be disruptive, NASA says on its website. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids and navigation signals. They also can pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.",
      "Solar flares are also often associated with coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says online. Often, CMEs look like \"huge, twisted ropes,\" NASA says, because they involve the sun's magnetic fields. Coronal mass ejections can also disrupt radio and satellite communications, and can also cause geomagnetic storms on Earth.",
      "In May 2024, a powerful coronal mass ejection brought the strongest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares were recorded. The storm caused some radio blackouts. Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

      "Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that \"the ceasefire is in effect.\"",
      "The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was \"on track\" to make that \"historic commitment\" of 5%.",
      "The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target.",
      "\"We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,\" he told reporters Friday. \"So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely.\"",
      "There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one.",

    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",

      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

    "summary": "The jury ordered that chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman must pay Erin Smith for assaulting her husband, Jeffrey Smith, inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "A federal jury on Monday awarded $500,000 to the widow and estate of a police officer who died by suicide nine days after he helped defend the U.S. Capitol from a mob of rioters, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the attack.",
      "The eight-member jury ordered that man, 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, to pay $380,000 in punitive damages and $60,000 in compensatory damages to Erin Smith for assaulting her husband, Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering.",
      "The judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Erin Smith's wrongful-death claim against Walls-Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman's actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith's death.",
      "Walls-Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. He says any injuries that the officer suffered on Jan. 6 occurred later in the day, when another rioter threw a pole that struck Smith around his head.",
      "On Friday, the jury sided with Erin Smith and held Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35-year-old husband \u2014 an encounter captured on the officer's body camera.",
      "\"Erin is grateful to receive some measure of justice,\" said David P. Weber, one of her attorneys.",
      "Walls-Kaufman said the outcome of the trial is \"absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "\"No crime happened. I never struck the officer. I never intended to strike the officer,\" he said. \"I'm just stunned.\"",
      "After the jury left the courtroom, Reyes encouraged the parties to confer and discuss a possible settlement to avoid the time and expense of an appeal and for the sake of \"finality.\"",
      "\"You guys settle, you can move on with your lives,\" the judge said.",
      "Walls-Kaufman's attorney, Hughie Hunt, described the jury's award as \"shocking.\"",
      "\"We're talking about a three-second event,\" he told the judge.",
      "\"It's not shocking, Mr. Hunt. A lot of things can happen in three seconds,\" Reyes replied.",
      "Jeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol riot when he shot himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the Jan. 6 riot. Erin Smith claims Walls-Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide.",
      "Body camera footage obtained by CBS News appears to show that Jeffrey Smith was the target of multiple assaults on Jan. 6, at least once inside the Capitol and then again a few hours later \u2014 outside at the west front of the Capitol. The images of the attack were pivotal to Erin Smith's efforts to change the designation of her husband's death.",
      "\"I think the physical attack on him changed him,\" Erin Smith told CBS News in 2022. \"If he didn't go to work that day, he'd still be here.\"",
      "The police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he died by suicide. In 2022, the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters' Retirement and Relief Board determined that Smith was injured in the line of duty and the injury was the \"sole and direct cause of his death,\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "Walls-Kaufman served a 60-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor in January 2023, but he was pardoned in January. On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack.",
      "More than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes. Howard Liebengood, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack.",
      "Erin Smith's quest isn't over. She applied for the National Law Enforcement Memorial to add her husband's name as a line-of-duty death. Weber said they're hoping for a decision soon.",

      "They searched Blaze's computer and social media accounts for clues. On Blaze's Snapchat, they found messages from Sam Woodward, who had been Blaze's high school classmate. The messaging showed that the night Blaze went missing, he had sent his address to Woodward. Gideon Bernstein reached out to Woodward, who claimed he had picked Blaze up and driven to local Borrego Park. Woodward said that Blaze then walked off in the dark to meet another friend.",
      "\"I didn't see where he went,\" Woodward told Gideon Bernstein. \"I searched all over for him ... I couldn't find him anywhere.\"",
      "After that call, the worried Bernsteins filed a missing person's report with police.",

      "Jan. 9, 2018",

      "April 9, 2024",
      "In the opening statements of his trial, the prosecution told the jury that Woodward killed Blaze because he was gay. Defense Attorney Ken Morrison conceded that Woodward killed Blaze but argued that the murder was not premeditated and instead was a case of voluntary manslaughter. He argued that Blaze did something that provoked Woodward to kill him and told the jury Woodward would testify about what happened the night Blaze was killed.",

      "Officials in Tallahassee first announced plans to help the federal government expand its capacity to hold detainees awaiting deportation last week.",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said a largely abandoned airfield in the Everglades would be repurposed as a detention facility to house immigrants living in the U.S. illegally with criminal records. He dubbed it \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" saying any detainees seeking to escape would face alligators and pythons in the treacherous wetlands surrounding the site.",
      "On Monday, Uthmeier announced the federal government had \"approved\" the state's plan to build \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and other facilities that he said could collectively house as many as 5,000 detainees. He said the facilities could start receiving detainees early next month, calling them temporary.",
      "\"There's really nowhere to go. If you're housed there, if you're detained there, there's no way in, no way out,\" Uthmeier said in an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, describing the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" facility.",

The judge, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams, ruled that the measure is likely unconstitutional.",

And without this court's intervention, Florida and its citizens will remain disabled from combatting the serious harms of illegal immigration for years as this litigation proceeds through the lower courts.\"",
      "Williams had initially issued a temporary restraining order that prohibited enforcement of the immigration law and ordered the attorney general to notify all law enforcement agencies in the state of her injunction. Uthmeier circulated a letter to those agencies in April informing them that officers and agents should comply with Williams' directives. But in a follow-up letter, the attorney general told the law enforcement community that \"no judicial order \u2026 properly restrains you from\" enforcing the law, and that \"no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce\" it.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Jun 2025 18:26:40 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to pause a judge's order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without first providing them due process.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a lower court order that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to countries that are not their places of origin without first giving them the chance to raise fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "The order from the high court is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced recent setbacks from the justices in its efforts to swiftly deport migrants as part of its crackdown on immigration. The Supreme Court's order clears the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision Monday regarding third country removals.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Sotomayor accused the federal government of \"flagrantly unlawful conduct\" and called the majority's decision to intervene at this stage in the case \"inexcusable.\"",
      "\"The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,\" she wrote, joined by Kagan and Jackson.",
      "Sotomayor said that the court is \"rewarding lawlessness\" with a decision that will undermine the foundational principle of due process.",
      "\"Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,\" Sotomayor said. \"That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security called the Supreme Court ruling \"a victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "\"DHS can now execute its lawful authority and remove illegal aliens to a country willing to accept them,\" the statement read in part. \"Fire up the deportation planes.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's latest order came in a court fight over the Trump administration's efforts to swiftly deport some migrants to third countries, or countries other than the ones designated on an order of removal. As part of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda and plans for mass deportations, his administration has approached nations like Costa Rica, Panama and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "The administration has also already entered into an arrangement with the government of El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants who it claims are gang members, though a \"60 Minutes\" investigation found most have no apparent criminal records. The migrants have been confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, often under a 1798 wartime law.",
      "The Supreme Court previously said in a\u00a0pair\u00a0of\u00a0decisions\u00a0arising from other emergency appeals that migrants facing deportation under that wartime law must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",
      "Four migrants from Latin America filed a broader lawsuit in March on behalf of a nationwide class of all people potentially subject to third-country removals and argued they are entitled to notice and an opportunity to contest their removals on the grounds they fear persecution, torture and death.",
      "In the weeks after the suit was filed, administration officials were engaged in a simmering showdown with a Boston-based federal judge, who in April found that the government had violated migrants' due process rights and blocked immigration authorities from quickly removing them to third countries unless certain steps are first taken.",
      "The judge, Brian Murphy, said the government first had to give the affected migrants written notice of the third country to which they may be deported and a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise fears of torture, persecution or death in that country.",
      "Third-country deportations challenged in court",
      "Since Murphy issued his nationwide injunction in April, immigration lawyers have notified him that a group of migrants from Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines were being prepared to be deported to Libya and Saudi Arabia, though the deportation flights do not appear to have happened. Murphy then concluded last month that the Trump administration violated his order when it attempted to swiftly deport a group of men with criminal histories to war-torn South Sudan with less than 24 hours notice and no chance for them to raise fear-based claims.",
      "South Sudan endured a bloody years-long civil war shortly after gaining independence in 2011, and the United Nations\u00a0warns\u00a0violence has escalated in recent months. The State Department has\u00a0warned\u00a0Americans not to travel to the country due to \"crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.",
      "Murphy halted the deportations to South Sudan, and the men are being held at a U.S. naval base in nearby Djibouti, a small country on the Horn of Africa. The judge said federal immigration authorities must give six of the deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews to determine whether they are at risk of persecution or torture.",
      "Murphy left it up to the Department of Homeland Security to either conduct the interviews within the U.S. or abroad, but said the department had to retain \"custody and control\" over the men.",
      "A U.S. immigration official revealed in a June 4 filing that the migrants are being held in a conference room in a converted shipping container on the naval base and are guarded by 11 ICE officers. The official, Mellissa Harper, described in an affidavit the conditions facing the migrants and the immigration authorities, who she said have felt ill since arriving in Djibouti, which uses burn pits to dispose of trash and human waste.",
      "The ICE officers were unable to take anti-malaria medication for up to 72 hours before arriving in Djibouti and have experienced coughing, difficulty breathing, fever and achy joint, Harper said. They were also warned by defense officials that they were in \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen, and the ICE officers do not have body armor or other gear to put on in case of an attack, she said.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to pause Murphy's injunction, which Solicitor General D. John Sauer said was thwarting the administration's attempts to deport what it describes as the \"worst of the worst illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process,\" he wrote in a filing. \"In addition to usurping the executive's authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts.\"",
      "He said Murphy's injunction created a \"diplomatic and logistical morass.\"",
      "But lawyers for the migrants at risk of deportation to third countries said the criteria laid out in the lower court's injunction are mandated by federal law and regulations, U.S. treaty obligations and the Constitution.",
      "The order, they said, \"simply requires defendants to comply with the law when carrying them out.\"",
      "The immigration lawyers said over the past weeks, the Trump administration \"repeatedly sought to remove people as a punitive measure, to some of the most dangerous places on the planet, and with only hours' notice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping immigration crackdown since he returned to the White House for a second term. The president's administration has since moved to end a Temporary Protected Status program that shielded 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation and to revoke the legal status of roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed him to move forward with terminating both of those programs while legal proceedings continue.",
      "Mr. Trump also has sought to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, though several courts have ruled that the president cannot use the law to detain or remove certain migrants.",

      "Chief Ryan Strong said 911 calls about the shooting at CrossPointe Community Church on the 36000 block of Glenwood Road started coming in around 11:06 a.m. Investigators say the suspect, later identified by officials as 31-year-old Brian Anthony Browning from Romulus, Michigan, was driving recklessly when he arrived at the church.",
      "\"The suspect exited his vehicle wearing a tactical vest, armed with a long gun and handgun,\" Strong said.",
      "The man then started firing one of his weapons at the church from the outside, police said. One of the parishioners struck the man with his vehicle, and at least two staff members shot at him, killing the attacker, police said. The suspect was pronounced dead on the scene by Wayne Fire Rescue.",
      "A livestream of the church's morning service showed parishioners, including several women and children, running to the back of the church when they heard the gunshots. CrossPointe Community Church Pastor Bobby Kelly Jr. said there were about 150 people at the service at the time.",
      "One of the staff members who shot at the man was a security guard for the church, police said. He was shot in the leg by the gunman. Both employees were taken to the hospital with injuries that are not considered life-threatening, according to police.",
      "Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said in a post on X Sunday afternoon that leadership and support teams are at the scene \"providing assistance and investigative support.\"",
      "Police are working to learn the motive behind the shooting. They have learned that the suspect's mother is a member of the church and he did attend services there two or three times in the past year. He did not have a criminal history or any previous contacts with the Wayne Police Department.",
      "The suspect was armed with an AR-15 style rifle with more than a dozen fully loaded magazines, a semi-automatic handgun with an extended magazine and \"hundreds of rounds of ammunition,\" a follow up police report issued Monday morning said. There has been a search warrant served at his home, where additional rifles, several more semi-automatic handguns and an additional large amount of ammunition was seized and confiscated.",
      "Statements from the church",
      "Pastor Bobby Kelly Jr. spoke with CBS News Detroit about how the parishioners were feeling in the hours after the shooting.",
      "\"The people who were very distraught and really broken up about this, they still took it very well because they recognized what could've happened that did not happen,\" he said.",
      "Kelly also issued a written statement to the media Monday about the incident, which reads in part:",
      "As details emerge, we are seeing God's hand of protection more clearly in what could have been, simply wasn't.",
      "There are many heroes, both men and women who acted bravely and selflessly to prevent an all out catastrophe. Among these were the members of our security team who engaged the subject and subdued the threat. There is also the church member who was divinely positioned to see the assailant approaching the church in full tactical gear, including an assault rifle, and acted swiftly to hit him with his truck, injuring him. This action kept the gunman from ever entering the building and gave our security team extra needed seconds to respond. Glory to God!",
      "To the Wayne Police, EMS, and Fire, along with the other localities that arrived on scene, thank you for your very swift response to secure the scene and offer support and comfort as we tried to catch our breath from this attack.",
      "Lastly, we are extremely encouraged by the response from several local churches, grief counseling agencies who have reached out to assist. We will be taking advantage of as much as we can to help us move forward. But most importantly, thank you for all of your many prayers. They are much needed at this time.",
      "Parishioner describes harrowing moments during the shooting",
      "Parishioner Dustin Fuoco, who lives on the church property and runs the facility's sound system, told CBS News on Sunday that he initially couldn't find his wife and newborn baby after the gunshots rang out.",

      "He said the crew heard another round of 10 shots about 20 seconds later.",
      "\"At that point, we all realized it was a shooter,\" Fuoco said. \"So the first thing I did at that point was, being up there by myself, I ran right downstairs because in the room right next to the first level is the baby room. So that's where my wife and newborn were. And [I was] very terrified because that room was emptied out. So, at that point, everybody's scattering.\"",

      "Michelle Chavez: No, no, none at all.",
      "But as it would turn out, Anna and Will were not headed to a wedding.",
      "Amie Matusko: They go to the beach, and the officiant doesn't show up. So, he has a phone call in which he relays to both the witnesses and to Anna that the officiant couldn't make it, he was ill, something came up.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: William Hargrove was actually calling a couple video game stores to \u2026 presumably pretend he was talking to a wedding official to show 'em how mad he was about this day.",

      "Tracy Smith: So, did you give him an ultimatum?",
      "Michelle Chavez: At one point I did. I told him he had to pick one \u2026 I didn't want anything bad to happen to her. I just didn't want her here.",
      "Tracy Smith: So, you pressured him to choose?",
      "Michelle Chavez: I did.",
      "AN ULTIMATUM",
      "In April 2017, the relationship between Michelle Chavez and Will Hargrove hit a crossroads with Michelle insisting Will finally choose between her and Anna. Will told Michelle she was his choice.",
      "Tracy Smith: So, April 19th was the deadline for both of you?",
      "Michelle Chavez: Correct.",
      "Tracy Smith: You were gonna be done with your marriage. And he was supposed to ...",
      "Michelle Chavez: She was supposed to be gone or whatever. \u2026 He was going to leave her.",
      "Tracy Smith: How much pressure did Michelle put on Will to get rid of Anna?",
      "Amie Matusko: A lot. There was a lot of pressure. \u2026 There's a lot of back and forth in there between all the text messages -- where one minute it's like, \"Clean out your stuff and get out,\" the next minute is, \"I love you, I wanna be together, but we can't do that if she's here.\"",
      "Tracy Smith: There are texts between the two of you with you pressuring him to choose, and at one point you told him to fix it. What'd you mean by that?",
      "Michelle Chavez: In the general sense. \u2026 Fix it in the sense that you would take care of it, not take care of it like take somebody out. \u2026 You would end the relationship, that you would be done.",
      "Will told Michelle he'd tried to send Anna packing many times, but she wouldn't go.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: So, Michelle perceived Anna as this girl who kinda never got the hint, that she was being told to leave and she kept coming back \u2026 although Anna never knew any of this was really happening.",
      "On Saturday night, April 15, just four days shy of the deadline they'd set, Michelle was supposed to have dinner at Will's apartment.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: It wasn't until about 8 p.m. that night that William Hargrove tells Michelle Chavez that -- she actually can't come over, that Anna showed back up, that Anna's back again. He'll take care of it.",
      "What followed was yet another heated text conversation. Not a surprise according to Detective Chris Dale, who says Michelle and Will exchanged more than 13,000 texts during their relationship.",
      "Det. Chris Dale: Constant checking in every morning to make sure that he's woken up on time -- to get to work. \u2026 It didn't seem as if there was an hour in a day that went by where they were not communicating.",
      "But on that day, there was one critical text.",
      "Amie Matusko: So, Will Hargrove sent a message to Miss Chavez, \"I will have this permanently fixed by 18:00 tomorrow.\"",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: So, he'll have the situation of Anna Repkina handled by 6:00 p.m. the following day, which was Easter Sunday.",
      "That assurance was not enough for Michelle. She contined texting and calling Will, who turned off his phone. As the hours passed with no reply, Michelle's hope that Will was truly \"fixing\" the problem with Anna \u2026 vanished.",

      "Meanwhile, back at his apartment, Will was dealing with a very different but urgent problem: his car insurance policy.",
      "Amie Matusko: They've been sending him notices that if he doesn't have it paid by midnight on the 16th, they're gonna cancel his insurance.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: He tells them that he knows his insurance lapses that evening, and he needs to get it \u2013 extended -- for free -- because if it doesn't he's gonna lose his -- vehicle loan and they're gonna repossess it immediately.",
      "WILLIAM HARGROVE [phone call]: OK. Can you guys hold off until the 21st so I can get you paid?",
      "PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE AGENT: Um, unfortunately once it is pending cancellation for nonpayment, we don't have the ability to move the dates at all um, and this one \u2026 yeah, so it'll be effect -- canceled effective tonight at midnight.",
      "Just after 4:30 p.m., Michelle's phone rang. It was Will.",
      "Tracy Smith: And what did he say?",
      "Michelle Chavez: That he had been out at the coast. \u2026 He was on his way back in and \u2026 he'd almost hit a deer. He ran off the road and had a flat tire and he needed help.",
      "Tracy Smith: How did he sound?",
      "Michelle Chavez: Shaken, sad.",
      "And so, Michelle left her family's Easter celebration to go meet Will in the town of Alsea. He waited for her at a local convenience store.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: You can see him walk to the -- cooler where he gets -- a Pepsi. He goes and gets his candy bar. And then he ultimately gets a pack of cigarettes.",
      "About an hour later, Michelle arrived.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: She parks on the side of that store. We see her get out of her Prius.",
      "Michelle Chavez: I asked him, \"what happened? Where have you been?\" \u2026",
      "He told me that he -- after we had talked to they had gotten to an argument and he said horrible, mean things to her then that she had turned around and taken her suitcases and had walked out.",
      "Thinking Anna had finally left the apartment for good, Michelle says she and Will got into his car.",
      "Michelle Chavez: We drove for a little bit. \u2026 We'd pulled off and we were talking for a few. And then honestly, we end up having sex in the front seat.",
      "Tracy Smith: So, you had makeup sex, essentially.",
      "Michelle Chavez: Yeah, essentially. Makeup sex in the front seat.",
      "Michelle and Will then went their separate ways, with Michelle returning to her family's Easter celebration.",
      "Jamie Klotz: She came back, she was in a good mood. She was smiling. She was -- you know, she was happy. She looked total 180 from what she looked like in the morning.",
      "Will headed home, but he made a few stops along the way. First, at an ATM where he withdrew money from Anna's bank account.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: Made a $200 withdrawal from this machine, and then engaged in some conversation with some employees -- at that gas station, where he actually ended up hugging one of them and crying about the fact that his girlfriend, Anna Repkina -- had left him.",
      "Tracy Smith: His girlfriend, whose account he just took $200 from?",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: Yes.",
      "Will then headed to a second ATM.",
      "Amie Matusko: He goes to the Chase Bank and withdraws an additional $600 of Anna Repkina's money.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: So now William Hargrove has $800 -- that he stole from Anna Repkina's bank account. \u2026 \u00a0At about 9:00, 9:30 p.m. on that same night \u2026 he drives to -- another bank and he ends up depositing $160 of that cash into his bank account.",
      "Will had just one more chore to take care of that evening.",
      "PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE AGENT [phone call]: Thank you for calling Progressive. \u2026",
      "WILL HARGROVE: Y'all should have a card on file for me and I need to make a payment please.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: Several hours earlier he has no money.",
      "WILL HARGROVE [phone call]: All good, then? Everything's done?",
      "PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE AGENT: Yep. Everything is taken care of, you are insured as we're speaking.",
      "WILL HARGROVE: Excellent. Thank you very much ma'am.",
      "PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE AGENT: My pleasure. Have a good night, William.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: All of a sudden, he has money and he's taking it out of Anna Repkina's bank account, who's found dead the next day.",
      "\"A HORRIBLE MISTAKE\"",
      "On April 17, 2017 \u2013 the day after Easter Sunday \u2013 Anna Repkina was found with a shotgun blast to the back of the head, her body left like one more piece of garbage.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: Anna was discarded in this landing with the other trash.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: Fast food bags, cigarette cartons, candy wrappers that were -- that were here. And at that point, we don't know what's evidence and what's not. Because that could either be huge evidence in this case or it could be just trash.",
      "While investigators hoped to find a connection to Anna's killer, Will was sending Anna texts, showing concern about her whereabouts after the fight he said they'd had the day before.",
      "WILL HARGROVE [text to Anna]: Just let me know you are safe?",

      "Det. Chris Dale: Yes.",

      "On Wednesday, April 19, investigators struck a lead with the trash found next to Anna's body: a KFC receipt from three days earlier with a crucial timestamp.",
      "Tracy Smith: Was there a name on the receipt?",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: So, on the receipt there was no name. \u2026 KFC told us that there was actually a car that pulled up on that Friday. And there was two purchases made from that car. There was one made with a debit card that came back to Kevin Thomas. And another purchase that was made with cash.",
      "With only one name to work with, investigators headed to Kevin's Corvallis home.",

Kevin, like Joseph Thompson, called will his \"brother.\" Police continued talking to Kevin at the sheriff's office, where he offered a revelation. A few weeks earlier, will had asked to borrow something that belonged to Kevin: his shotgun.",
      "DET. ADAM MILLER: Did he say why he wanted to borrow it?",
      "KEVIN THOMAS: Just that he was gonna go up and go shooting in the woods and just kind of blow off some steam.",
      "What's more, Kevin told police that will had yet to return the gun. With this new information, investigators headed straight to Michelle's house, where Will was staying to question him. He answered the door.",

      "WILL HARGROVE: Yeah, I did. On the side of the building. On the side of the general store.",
      "But that trash that will claimed to have left at the store, was the very same that was found next to Anna's body. Investigators asked Will to come to the sheriff's office. While Will was getting ready to leave, he texted Michelle to ensure their stories matched.",

      "LT. CHRIS DUFFITT: OK. So, uh William Hargrove, I need you to stand up and put your hands behind your back. You're under arrest for the murder of Anna Repkina.",

      "Tracy Smith [to prosecutors Ryan Joslin and Amie Matusko]: If anyone on the face of it looks like they have a motive to kill Anna, it's the other woman. It's Michelle. How can you be so sure that she had nothing to do with Anna's murder?",

      "Just hours after Will Hargrove was arrested for Anna Repkina's murder, Michelle Chavez was brought in for questioning about what she was doing Easter Sunday.",
      "MICHELLE CHAVEZ: Can you tell me what this is about though?",

      "Michelle Chavez: I was numb. It didn't make sense.",
      "Over a year later, in July 2018, Will was formally indicted for Anna's murder. The defense would go on to spin an entirely different theory of the crime, one that had Michelle pulling the trigger after arriving from her family's Easter celebration. According to them:",
      "Amie Matusko: The defendant had taken Michelle Chavez up to the location -- to have a conversation with Anna, and \u2026 Michelle had taken the gun out from him and shot Anna.",
      "A few pieces of evidence had given investigators cause for concern. For one thing, Michelle mysteriously ended up in possession of Anna's phone. Michelle blames Will.",
      "Michelle Chavez: I didn't realize it was hers. He had given it to me, I guess, the night before he got arrested.",
      "Michelle's own cellphone records showed that a month before Anna's body was found, Michelle had visited that exact spot on the logging road. Michelle claims that's only because Will brought her there, but could she have been scouting the location?",
      "Tracy Smith: The defense says that Will loved Anna, that he was starting a life with her, that you're the one with all the reasons to kill her. What do you say to that?",
      "Michelle Chavez: I had no reason to want her dead. No reason to kill her.",
      "Michelle Chavez: I do get how it looks, but her being dead is nothing I ever wanted. I wanted her to go home.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did you ever tell Will to kill Anna?",
      "Michelle Chavez: No.",
      "Days after Will's arrest, his friend Kevin's shotgun was recovered from the back of Will's vehicle. Evidence supports there'd only been one killer.",

      "Piecing together various security cameras, investigators tracked Will's drive with Anna to Alsea.",
      "Ryan Joslin: We see the defendant's car that's distinct for various reasons, traveling along a certain path. And it gave us location as well as timeframes.",
      "But it was GPS tracking that gave police an even bigger piece of the puzzle with Will's phone pinging from the murder site from 4:35 to 4:48 that afternoon.",
      "Amie Matusko: The reason we have that is because he called Michelle Chavez.",
      "Michelle Chavez -- who was still at her mother's house at that Easter celebration.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: We don't have any forensic data or information that was left at that crime scene to suggest that Michelle was at the crime scene on that day.",
      "And remember that video of Will shopping at the Alsea convenience store as he waited for Michelle to arrive?",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: Towards the top of his bald head, you can see what appears to be -- smaller black -- dots.",
      "Raising the question: could it have been blood spatter?",
      "Amie Matusko: We can't tell you if that was blood. We can't tell you what that was. But we can tell you it was there before he met Michelle Chavez. \u2026 Subsequent photo comparison afterwards show that those spots weren't moles. They weren't anything that was there permanently.",
      "There was one more heart-wrenching piece of evidence found in the trash alongside Anna's body from another fast food drive-thru.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: A receipt from McDonald's -- in Newport, Oregon. \u2026 Dated on March 25th of 2017.",

      "AMIE MATUSKO [in court]: I wanna talk about Anna Repkina for a minute. And I placed her photo on the witness stand to remind everyone of a life that was lost.",
      "Will's sentencing was held in January 2020.",
      "AMIE MATUSKO [in court]: She came here with hopes and dreams to find somebody that was loving her and start a family. She doesn't have that anymore. \u2026 The defendant very nearly got away with this crime. It was his own trash that betrayed him.",
      "Will received a life sentence with a possibility of parole after 25 years.",

    "summary": "Will Hargrove's bizarre online searches and suspicious behavior caught on camera helped police piece together what happened to his bride-to-be.",
    "story": [
      "A Russian bride-to-be was found dead 5,500 miles from home. Investigators would soon learn Anna Repkina was unwittingly caught up in a love triangle and that her fianc\u00e9 frantically researched time travel after her death, writing to strangers on WhatsApp: \"\u2026 best friend made a mistake. I want to go back to keep from losing the woman that should be my wife.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Tracy Smith reports on the case in \"The Murder of Anna Repkina.\"",
      "In 2016, Repkina was a 26-year-old Moscow native who loved rock music and cats and had a fun sense of humor. She had recently gone through a breakup with her boyfriend of seven years. In search of love, she decided to join some online dating sites. She thought she'd found what she was looking for when she met William Hargrove, a 26-year-old Oregonian who happened to have an affinity for all things Russian.",
      "Their online relationship quickly took off, and Repkina decided to fly to the United States to meet her new love interest in person and spend the Christmas holidays with him in Oregon. After a whirlwind 10-day trip, Repkina returned to Russia with a souvenir \u2014 an engagement ring from Hargrove. She made plans to pack up her life in Russia, move to Oregon, and plan a wedding.",
      "What Repkina wasn't planning on was meeting Hargrove's secret girlfriend.",
      "When Repkina first met Hargrove, he was renting a room from a woman named Michelle Chavez, who was living with her husband in a loveless marriage. Unbeknownst to Repkina, Hargrove and Chavez were involved in a passionate affair even before she came to the states. Hargrove and Chavez continued their relationship after Hargrove's proposal to Repkina, and when Repkina moved to Oregon to marry Hargrove, Chavez was shocked, and very angry.",
      "Chavez wanted Hargrove to only be with her, and pressured him to end his relationship with Repkina. She issued an ultimatum \u2014 to choose between her and Repkina. Within days, Repkina was dead.",
      "The day after Easter 2017, Repkina's body was found on a remote logging road in Alsea, Oregon. She had been killed by a single shotgun blast to the back of the head. But who pulled the trigger?",
      "That's the question the lead detective, Lieutenant Chris Duffitt, was trying to answer when he first arrived on the scene. \"We found several pieces of trash,\" said Duffitt. \"Fast food bags, cigarette cartons, candy wrappers that were here. And at that point, we don't know what's evidence and what's not.\"",
      "One of the pieces of trash turned out to be a treasure. Investigators were able to trace the information found on a KFC receipt back to Will Hargrove.",
      "In the days after Repkina's death, Hargrove exhibited some rather peculiar behavior.",
      "Hargrove went on a bizarre internet deep dive. \"He is researching time travel,\" said Detective Chris Dale. \"He's saved screenshots of web pages that show you how to do a particular spell to travel back in time. And we also see communication through WhatsApp in which he is trying to ask for help in how to travel back in time.\" Hargrove said he wanted to correct a horrible mistake that his \"best friend\" made. He was so desperate to get this information on time travel that he offered his soul as a reward to strangers on the internet who might be able to help him.",
      "In addition to his strange internet encounters, Hargrove was caught on video surveillance at various ATM's withdrawing cash from Repkina's account. \"He made a $200 withdrawal from this machine, and then engaged in some conversation with some employees at that gas station, where he actually ended up hugging one of them and crying about the fact that his girlfriend, Anna Repkina, had left him,\" said Duffitt.",
      "Hargrove withdrew a total of $800 from Repkina's account. With a sudden influx of cash, he made a car insurance payment, went shopping at Walmart for Star Wars themed LEGOs, and bought candy and cigars.",
      "After connecting Hargrove to the crime scene through the KFC receipt, investigators brought Hargrove in for questioning and ultimately charged him with Repkina's murder. The trash left near Repkina's body, Hargrove's strange internet encounters, and theft caught on camera led Hargrove to be formally indicted for his fianc\u00e9e's murder in July 2018.",
      "But when Hargrove's trial began in October 2019, the defense would spin an entirely new theory as to what happened to Repkina.",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: On October 2019, Hargrove was was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 25 years. Hargrove's murder conviction was overturned on appeal in 2023. The reversal was based on a flawed search warrant and the improper collection of some evidence. In April 2025, a new trial began and in June 2025, Hargrove was reconvicted and resentenced to life in prison with a possibility of parole after 25 years.",

      "JetBlue Airways is ceasing service at Miami International Airport as the discount carrier moves to cut costs by eliminating less profitable routes.",
      "Miami International officials told CBS News Miami this weekend that the last JetBlue flight is scheduled for September 3.",
      "The airport is not a key hub for JetBlue. The airline operates only a single route into Miami International, offering one to two daily flights between the city and Boston's Logan International Airport, according to JetBlue spokesperson Derek Dombrowski. JetBlue serves over three dozen cities in the U.S., according to its route\u00a0map.",
      "For passengers heading to South Florida, JetBlue will continue to operate out of nearby Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport. The latter, roughly 25 miles north of Miami, offered 70 daily flights to over 30 destinations as of April of this year.",
      "JetBlue will also suspend its year-round service between Boston and Seattle starting October 25, offering flights between the two cities solely during the summer season, according to Dombrowski.",
      "The shift in services align with changes outlined by JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty in an internal memo shared with CBS News last week. In it, Geraghty said the company would \"wind down underperforming routes\" as part of a larger effort to reduce costs amid softening demand for travel.",
      "\"We're hopeful demand and bookings will rebound, but even a recovery won't fully offset the ground we've lost this year, and our path back to profitability will take longer than we'd hoped,\" she said in the memo. \"That means we're still relying on borrowed cash to keep the airline running.\"",
      "The decision to terminate service at Miami International comes four years after JetBlue added the airport to its network. At its peak, the airline was operating as many as 14 daily flights to and from Miami International, according to the Miami Herald.",
      "JetBlue customers with flights booked to or from Miami after September 3 will be contacted and offered alternative travel options via Fort Lauderdale or a full refund, according to Dombrowski.",

      "Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies\u00a0said\u00a0they were entering a \"long-term collaboration\" to make obesity treatment more accessible.",
      "Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement.",
      "Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using \"knock-off, compounded versions\" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug.",
      "This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices.",
      "\"After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,\" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration.\"",
      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF.",

    "summary": "Real estate company Compass claims Zillow is illegally undermining competition by banning property listings if they don't appear on Zillow within 24 hours.",
    "story": [
      "Real estate giant Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule that bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow.",
      "Zillow's rule, announced by the company in April, took effect on May 28, with the company saying that the new standard is necessary to ensure that listings are \"marketed to every buyer\" to give house-hunters \"fair access to listings without having to get access behind a velvet rope controlled by any one company.\"",
      "But Compass, which seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites, is alleging that what it calls the \"Zillow ban\" violates federal antitrust laws. The real estate company claims that ZIllow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"This lawsuit is about protecting consumer choice,\" Compass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a statement. \"No one company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model.\"",
      "He added, \"That's not competition. It's coercion. Imagine if Amazon banned a seller for offering a product on their own website first. That's what Zillow is doing in real estate. Consumers should have the right to choose how they sell their homes.\"",
      "Compass said it has hired Ken Dintzer, a partner in the antitrust division of law firm Crowell & Moring who led the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Google, to represent it in the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a Zillow spokesperson said Compass' claims \"are unfounded\" and that it will fight the lawsuit.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"At the heart of this issue is a simple principle: When a listing is publicly marketed, it should be accessible to all buyers \u2014 across all platforms, including Zillow. Hiding listings creates a fragmented market, limits consumer choice and creates barriers to homeownership, which is bad for buyers, sellers and the industry at large, especially in this inventory and affordability-constrained environment.\"",
      "Private exclusives",
      "With the lawsuit, Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers. The first step in the strategy is a \"private exclusive\" listing that is available on Compass' internal platform, which allows its agents to share information about the home with possible buyers.",
      "The second step involves a \"coming soon\" listing on Compass's website, available to anyone who searches online for properties. The third element involves moving the listing to multiple listing services, or MLS, and onto aggregation sites like Zillow.",
      "\"For Zillow, every home buyer search conducted on Compass instead of Zillow is a lost opportunity for Zillow to lock that prospective home buyer into Zillow's ecosystem and make money selling her information to real estate agents for a lead fee \u2014 Zillow's central business model,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The complaint alleges that \"Zillow doesn't like the 3-phased marketing strategy because Zillow can't make money selling leads off listings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 where they don't have the listings.\"",
      "Compass, which has more than 33,000 real estate agents, said that almost half of all sellers who signed with them relied on its three-step listing strategy in the first quarter.",
      "\"In a free and competitive market, competitors' products and strategies should rise and fall on merit \u2014 not the whims of a monopolist gatekeeper like Zillow,\" Compass claims in the suit.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider a religious rights case brought by a former Louisiana inmate who is seeking to sue Louisiana prison officials for money damages for shaving his dreadlocks in violation of his religious beliefs.",
      "The high court will review a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that said the former inmate, Damon Landor, could not seek monetary damages against the officials in their individual capacities under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA.",
      "Landor is a devout Rastafarian who pledged to \"let the locks of the hair of his head grow,\" known as the Nazarite Vow. Landor upheld that pledge for nearly 20 years, until he was nearly finished with a five-month prison sentence in Louisiana.",
      "For the first four months of his incarceration, the two facilities where Landor was housed allowed him to keep his hair long or under a \"rastacap.\" But that changed after Landor was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center for the final three weeks of his sentence. Once there, Landor told an intake guard that he was a practicing Rastafarian and handed over proof of his religious accommodations, as well as a copy of a 2017 decision from the 5th Circuit that found Louisiana's policy of cutting Rastafarians' hair violated RLUIPA, according to court filings.",
      "But two guards ultimately handcuffed Landor to a chair, held him down and had his head shaved, according to papers filed with the Supreme Court.",
      "Landor filed a lawsuit against the prison officials after he was released and brought numerous claims, including under the RLUIPA. But a federal judge agreed to dismiss the case, finding that the law does not allow for damages against individual state officials.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the 5th Circuit affirmed that decision, ruling that while it \"emphatically\" condemned Landor's treatment, a prior decision in the circuit required it to hold that he could not seek money damages from officials in their individual capacities for violations of RLUIPA.",
      "The full 5th Circuit refused to reconsider the case, with 11 judges voting not to rehear it and six voting in favor.",
      "The case follows a Supreme Court decision from December 2020 in which it unanimously held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RLUIPA's sister statute, allows litigants to obtain money damages against federal officials in their individual capacities.",
      "Lawyers for Landor argued that Congress enacted the two laws to provide meaningful protection for religious liberty, and denying litigants the opportunity to seek damages for violations of RLUIPA would render that promise empty.",
      "Louisiana officials said in court papers that the allegations raised in Landor's appeal are \"antithetical to religious freedom and fair treatment of state prisoners,\" and condemned them \"in the strongest possible terms.\" But they urged the Supreme Court to turn away his appeal and said the state amended its prison grooming policy to prevent other inmates from being treated as Landor was.",

      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests. Such changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027.",
      "\"The health care system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, resulting in frustration for patients and providers alike,\" AHIP CEO Mike Tuffin said in a statement. \"Health plans are making voluntary commitments to deliver a more seamless patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care, while also helping to modernize the system.\"",
      "Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a statement that the insurance industry initiative is a \"step in the right direction,\" but that the real test will be the impact it has on the experiences of patients and physicians.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-detains-marine-corps-veteran-wife/",
    "published": "Mon, 23 Jun 2025 10:43:17 -0400",
    "summary": "ICE officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran in Louisiana during a routine immigration appointment.",
    "story": [
      "After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre's wife last month, he doesn't know how to tell his children where their mother went.",
      "When his nearly 2-year-old son Noah asks for his mother before bed, Clouatre just tells him, \"Mama will be back soon.\" When his 3-month-old, breastfeeding daughter Lyn is hungry, he gives her a bottle of baby formula instead. He's worried how his newborn will bond with her mother absent skin-to-skin contact.",
      "His wife, Paola, is one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the Trump administration pushes for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. Earlier this month, arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "Even as Marine Corps recruiters promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. The federal agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation, government memos show.",
      "To visit his wife, Adrian Clouatre has to make an eight-hour round trip from their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to a rural ICE detention center in Monroe. Clouatre, who qualifies as a service-disabled veteran, goes every chance he can get.",
      "Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old Mexican national whose mother brought her into the country seeking asylum more than a decade ago, met Adrian Clouatre, 26, at a Southern California nightclub during the final months of his five years of military service in 2022. Within a year, they had tattooed each other's names on their arms.",
      "After they married in 2024, Paola Clouatre sought a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. Adrian Clouatre said he is \"not a very political person\" but believes his wife deserved to live legally in the U.S.",
      "\"I'm all for 'get the criminals out of the country,' right?\" he said. \"But the people that are here working hard, especially the ones married to Americans \u2014 I mean, that's always been a way to secure a green card.\"",
      "Detained at a green card meeting",
      "The process to apply for Paola Clouatre's green card went smoothly at first, but eventually she learned ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing.",
      "Clouatre and her mother had been estranged for years \u2014 Clouatre cycled out of homeless shelters as a teenager \u2014 and up until a couple of months ago, Clouatre had \"no idea\" about her mother's missed hearing or the deportation order, her husband said.",
      "Adrian Clouatre recalled that a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staffer asked about the deportation order during a May 27 appointment as part of her green card application. After Paola Clouatre explained that she was trying to reopen her case, the staffer asked her and her husband to wait in the lobby for paperwork regarding a follow-up appointment, which her husband said he believed was a \"ploy.\"",
      "Soon, officers arrived and handcuffed Paola Clouatre, who handed her wedding ring to her husband for safekeeping.",
      "Adrian Clouatre, eyes welling with tears, said he and his wife had tried to \"do the right thing\" and that he felt ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests, though he understood they were trying to do their jobs.",
      "\"It's just a hell of a way to treat a veteran,\" said Carey Holliday, a former immigration judge who is now representing the couple. \"You take their wives and send them back to Mexico?\"",
      "The Clouatres filed a motion for a California-based immigration judge to reopen the case on Paola's deportation order and are waiting to hear back, Holliday said.",
      "Less discretion for military families",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that Paola Clouatre \"is in the country illegally\" and that the administration is \"not going to ignore the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Ignoring an Immigration Judge's order to leave the U.S. is a bad idea,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a June 9 post on social platform X which appeared to refer to Clouatre's case. The agency added that the government \"has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre said the agency's X post does not accurately reflect his wife's situation because she entered the country as a minor with her mother, seeking asylum.",
      "\"She was not aware of the removal order, so she was not knowingly defying it,\" he said. \"If she had been arrested, she would have been deported long ago, and we would never have met.\"",
      "Prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member, said Holliday and Margaret Stock, a military immigration law expert.",
      "In a Feb. 28 memo, the agency said it \"will no longer exempt\" from deportation people in groups that had received more grace in the past. This includes the families of military personnel or veterans, Stock said. As of June 12, the agency said it has referred upward of 26,000 cases to ICE for deportation.",
      "USCIS still offers a program allowing family members of military personnel who illegally entered the U.S. to remain in the country as they apply for a green card. But there no longer appears to be room for leeway, such as giving a veteran's spouse like Paola Clouatre the opportunity to halt her active deportation order without facing arrest, Stock said.",
      "But numerous Marine Corps recruiters have continued to post ads on social media, geared toward Latinos, promoting enlistment as a way to gain \"protection from deportation\" for family members.",
      "\"I think it's bad for them to be advertising that people are going to get immigration benefits when it appears that the administration is no longer offering these immigration benefits,\" Stock said. \"It sends the wrong message to the recruits.\"",
      "Marine Corps spokesperson Master Sgt. Tyler Hlavac told The Associated Press that recruiters have now been informed they are \"not the proper authority\" to \"imply that the Marine Corps can secure immigration relief for applicants or their families.\"",

      "The best team all season was the best team at the end, bringing the NBA title to Oklahoma City for the first time.

      "\"It doesn't feel real,\" said Gilgeous-Alexander, the Finals MVP. \"So many hours. So many moments. So many emotions. So many nights of disbelief. So many nights of belief. It's crazy to know that we're all here, but this group worked for it. This group put in the hours and we deserve this.\"",
      "Jalen Williams scored 20 points and Chet Holmgren had 18 for the Thunder, who finished off a season for the ages. Oklahoma City won 84 games between the regular season and the playoffs, tying the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls for third most in any season.",
      "Only Golden State (88 in 2016-17) and the Bulls (87 in 2015-16) won more.",
      "It's the second championship for the franchise. The Seattle SuperSonics won the NBA title in 1979; the team was moved to Oklahoma City in 2008. There's nothing in the rafters in Oklahoma City to commemorate that title.",
      "In October, a championship banner is finally coming. A Thunder banner.",
      "\"They behave like champions. They compete like champions,\" Daigneault said. \"They root for each other's success, which is rare in professional sports. I've said it many times and now I'm going to say it one more time. They are an uncommon team and now they're champions.\"",
      "The Pacers led 48-47 at the half even after losing Haliburton to what his father said was an Achilles tendon injury about seven minutes into the game. But they were outscored 34-20 in the third quarter as the Thunder built a 13-point lead and began to run away.",
      "\"Deflated, but proud of everything we've accomplished,\" Pacers guard TJ McConnell said.",
      "Bennedict Mathurin had 24 points and 13 rebounds for Indiana, which still is waiting for its first NBA title. The Pacers \u2014 who were 10-15 after 25 games and were bidding to be the first team in NBA history to turn that bad of a start into a championship \u2014 had leads of 1-0 and 2-1 in the series, but they simply didn't have enough in the end.",
      "Home teams improved to 16-4 in\u00a0NBA Finals\u00a0Game 7s. And the Thunder became the seventh champion in the last seven seasons, a run of parity like none other in NBA history.",
      "Pacers forward Pascal Siakam was part of the Toronto team that won in 2019, Thunder guard Alex Caruso was part of the Los Angeles Lakers team that won in the pandemic \"bubble\" in 2020, Milwaukee won in 2021, Golden State in 2022, Pacers forward Thomas Bryant and Denver prevailed in 2023, and Boston won last year's title.",
      "And now, the Thunder get their turn. The youngest team to win a title in nearly a half-century has reached the NBA mountaintop.",
      "The Thunder are the ninth franchise to win a title in NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's 12 seasons. His predecessor, David Stern, saw eight franchises win titles in his 30 seasons as commissioner.",

    "summary": "The NATO summit follows a U.S. operation striking Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 and the announcement by President Trump of a ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday heads to a whirlwind NATO summit at the Hague, Netherlands, hours after he announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that \"the ceasefire is in effect.\"",
      "The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was \"on track\" to make that \"historic commitment\" of 5%.",
      "The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target.",
      "\"We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,\" he told reporters Friday. \"So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely.\"",
      "There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one.",
      "Aside from the conflict in the Middle East, Russia's war on Ukraine continues to be a top topic of concern for NATO members. It is not yet clear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique \u2014 Whitaker avoided directly answering a reporter's question about this.",
      "\"Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,\" Whitaker said, adding, \"I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies.\"",
      "He said that the U.S. is \"calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,\" and he went on to say that the U.S. is \"engaged at the highest levels\" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Shortly before the summit, on Saturday, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting\u00a0three Iranian sites\u00a0believed to be key to\u00a0Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was limited.\u00a0Iran fired\u00a0more than a dozen missiles at a\u00a0U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump called the retaliatory strikes \"very weak,\" and he said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\" Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also pointed out in a social media post after the Iranian strikes, \"We didn't harm anyone.\"",
      "Within hours, Mr. Trump made the announcement that Iran and Israel would implement a ceasefire and shortly bring the war to an end.",
      "The NATO summit will feature a single two-and-a-half-hour session, instead of multiple sessions. Mr. Trump also plans to meet separately with several world leaders on the sidelines, a senior U.S. official told reporters on a conference call Friday.",
      "The president leaves for the summit early Tuesday morning and returns Wednesday.",
      "NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is the largest defense alliance in the world, with 32 members, including the U.S. It was formed in the aftermath of World War II, and has grown since, with its latest additions being Finland in 2023 and Sweden in 2024.

Mr. Trump said both countries had violated the ceasefire, and he demanded that Israel recall warplanes and not \"drop those bombs.\"",
      "It was unclear whether Israel had already dispatched any jets to carry out new strikes on Iran, but Mr. Trump spoke after the Israeli defense chief said he had ordered further attacks on Tehran.",

All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly 'Plane Wave' to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect! Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

      "\"In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation \u2014 I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,\" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.",
      "The Chief of the General Staff for Israel's military, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, announced earlier that: \"In light of the severe violation of the ceasefire carried out by the Iranian regime, we will respond with force.\"",

      "\"Iran did. Israel did, too. I'm not happy with Israel. Don't go out first hour. Not happy with Iran, either,\" the president told reporters, adding that the two countries \"have been fighting for so long, that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. You understand that?\"",
      "In a separate message posted on his Truth Social network, Mr. Trump said: \"ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!\"",
      "Israel claims Iranian attacks after ceasefire, Iran denies it",
      "Israeli first responders said one Iranian missile hit the southern city of Beersheba on Tuesday morning, killing four people and wounding about 20 others.",
      "Later, at about 3:30 a.m. Eastern Time, sirens blared in northern Israel and the Israeli military said it had \"identified missiles launched from Iran.\"",
      "\"Defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat,\" the IDF said.",
      "Mr. Trump had said on Truth Social, just after 1 a.m. ET Tuesday, that a ceasefire he announced earlier between the arch rivals, \"IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!\"",
      "In a statement, the Israeli government said that, \"in light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire,\" adding a warning that Israel would \"respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "At about the same time, Iran's state-run media said the country had also started to abide by the ceasefire, following a \"parting shot with multiple rounds of strikes\" on Israel.",
      "But there was never any formal confirmation by Iranian officials, and Israel's military reported Iranian missile launches within a couple hours of the time the deal should have taken effect.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated earlier that Iran would respect the ceasefire, but only if Israel did the same.",
      "\"There is NO 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,\" Araghchi wrote in a post on X. \"However, provided that the Israeli regime stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people no later than 4 a.m. Tehran time [8:30 p.m. Eastern], we have no intention to continue our response afterwards.\"",
      "He said a \"final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later.\"",
      "Before Israeli alarms were heard in the north of the country, an IDF spokesperson said the ceasefire had gone into effect, but prior to that, Israel had attacked dozens of Iranian military targets throughout the night. The spokesperson said that before the ceasefire came into effect, about 20 missiles were fired from Iran towards Israel.",

Another 12 hours after that, or at midnight ET on Wednesday morning, the war would be considered over.",
      "In another Truth Social post later Monday night, following the Iranian foreign minister's comments, Mr. Trump wrote, in part, that Israel and Iran \"came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, 'PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW.\"",
      "Mr. Trump communicated directly with Netanyahu, while several other administration officials \u2014 Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 communicated with Iran through direct and indirect channels, the White House official said.",
      "Qatar helped broker the deal, another White House official said. Mr. Trump had asked the Qatari Emir to get Iran to agree to a ceasefire. Vance coordinated with the Qatari prime minister on details, and Iran agreed to the ceasefire after speaking to the prime minister. The official said the direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement.

      "Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began.",
      "Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:46:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",
      "What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices?",
      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

      "Update: This story was published before President Trump, on Tuesday morning, accused both Israel and Iran of violating the ceasefire he had announced just hours earlier. Then, after speaking with Israel's prime minister, Mr. Trump said Israel would not continue attacking Iran and declared, \"the Ceasefire is in effect.\"\u00a0Read more here.",
      "Israel and Iran said Tuesday they are complying with a ceasefire agreement announced by President Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said on Truth Social just after 1 a.m. ET Tuesday that a ceasefire he announced earlier between the two countries \"IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!\"",
      "The Israeli government announced that, \"In light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire. Israel will respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "At about the same time, Iranian state television said the ceasefire had begun.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed on a \"Complete and Total CEASEFIRE\", a move he said would end the more than weeklong conflict between the two countries.",
      "The ceasefire was to take hold in stages, the president said.",
      "Under the ceasefire announced by Mr. Trump Monday evening, Iran was to stop striking Israel in six hours (at midnight ET on Tuesday), and Israel was to stop striking Iran 12 hours after that (at noon ET Tuesday). Then, after another 12 hours, or at midnight ET Wednesday, the war would be considered over, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had reported a series of missile barrages from Iran both before and after Mr. Trump's midnight deadline for Iran to halt the strikes. Israel did not specify when the missiles were launched, and it's unclear whether the latest missile strikes violated the terms laid out by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hours after Mr. Trump's initial post, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested on X that Iran had stopped its strikes on Israel at 4 a.m. Tehran time (8:30 p.m. ET Monday). Iran's military operations \"continued until the very last minute,\" he wrote.",
      "But Araghchi also wrote that \"there is NO 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,\" though he added that Iran didn't plan to continue strikes on Israel if Israel also ceased strikes at the same time. The timeline laid out by Mr. Trump called for Israel to stop striking about 15 hours after the time specified by Araghchi.",
      "\"The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,\" Araghchi wrote.",
      "In another Truth Social post later Monday night, following the Iranian foreign minister's comments, Mr. Trump wrote, in part, that Israel and Iran \"came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, 'PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW.\"",
      "Prior to Araghchi's comments, a senior White House official told CBS News both sides had agreed to a ceasefire, with Israel agreeing as long as there are no further Iranian strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while several other administration officials \u2014 Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 communicated with Iran through direct and indirect channels, the White House official said.",
      "Qatar helped broker a deal, another White House official said. Mr. Trump had asked the Qatari Emir to get Iran to agree to a ceasefire. Vance coordinated with the Qatari prime minister on details, and Iran agreed to the ceasefire after speaking to the prime minister. The official said the direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.",
      "The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13 with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes \u2014 which killed several top Iranian military officials \u2014 prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel.",
      "At least 950 people have been killed and 3,450 wounded in Israel's strikes in Iran, including a mix of military personnel and civilians, the group Human Rights Activists told the\u00a0Associated Press. Iran's attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said.",
      "Iran called its response \"devastating and powerful,\" but Mr. Trump called it \"very weak.\" The president said in another social media post that he wanted \"to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost.\"",
      "Dispute over Iran's nuclear program still lingers",
      "It's not clear how the ceasefire announcement will impact a broader dispute over the fate of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Israel's campaign was primarily aimed at Iran's nuclear program, as the country's stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium has grown rapidly in recent months, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "Israel has alleged Iran was secretly \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\" But earlier this year, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was not making nuclear weapons, though \"pressure has probably built\" for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reauthorize the country's nuclear weapons program.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" about Iran's nuclear ambitions, telling reporters, \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the issue \"irrelevant\" in an interview Sunday\u00a0on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying Iranian officials \"have everything they need to build the weapon.\"",
      "Iran has long insisted its uranium enrichment program is peaceful.",
      "For weeks, Mr. Trump has sought a broader deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, but even before Israel began striking Iran, administration officials had grown frustrated with what they viewed as Iran's unwillingness to actually negotiate, a U.S. official told CBS News. Mr. Trump has suggested Iran should abandon all uranium enrichment, but Iran rejected that demand.",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend the U.S.'s strikes had \"obliterated\" three Iranian nuclear sites, including two subterranean uranium enrichment facilities, though Iran has downplayed the damage.",

      "U.S. military assets in the Middle East",
      "The U.S. operates eight permanent military bases in as many countries across the Middle East \u2014\u00a0Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Kuwait, Egypt and Iraq \u2014 with nearly a dozen more military facilities across the region, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Chief among these permanent bases is Al Udeid, in Qatar, with up to 10,000 service personnel. Just west, Bahrain is home to a U.S. naval base called Naval Support Activity Bahrain with an estimated 9,000 troops. An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 U.S. service members are stationed across the region.",
      "\"There's a range of options in Iran's own target deck,\" Middle East security expert Burcu Ozcelik at the UK's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) told CBS News. \"Unlike Iran's targeting of Israel, which is far more difficult geographically due to the distance, Iran's stockpile or arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles makes American military installations in the Gulf more vulnerable. They're softer targets in that sense.\"",
      "Iraq, which shares a nearly-1,000 mile porous border with Iran to the east, \"tends to be seen as the next potential frontline in where the conflict can escalate,\" she said, because of \"a number of Iran-linked Shia paramilitary groups\" that may act independently from the Iranian government. Such groups have in the past attacked the U.S. Al Asad Air Base in Iraq and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.",
      "U.S. naval assets, which include aircraft carriers and their accompanying destroyers, along with various amphibious and other support ships, are also potential targets. The USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group is currently deployed in the Arabian Sea, while President Trump redirected the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to the Middle East from the South China Sea. The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier is also en route. Several U.S. guided-missile destroyers are patrolling the Red Sea, Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean.",
      "These dozens of ships provide possible targets for various forms of Iranian attacks, including \"heavily armed speedboats, short-range ballistic missiles, surface to air missiles,\" said Ozcelik, \"that could target American vessels or American allied vessels, similar to what the Houthis have been exercising in the Red Sea. And so Iran would replicate those techniques, but potentially on a larger and more lethal scale.\"",
      "Strait of Hormuz and 20% of the world's oil",
      "U.S. military assets aside, Iran could cause global economic and energy pain by attempting to choke off passage through the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly 20% to 25% of the world's oil passes, along with a similar percentage of liquified natural gas. The crucial waterway connects oil-rich Persian Gulf nations to the Gulf of Oman then the world. At its narrowest point, it stretches just 21 miles across, with Iran to the north and Oman and the United Arab Emirates to the south.",
      "Iran's navy could lay thousands of mines to damage ships trying to pass through. RUSI's Ozcelik said this would symbolize a desperate \"act of last resort,\" which would mean Iran is \"reeling out of control and spiraling.\"",
      "\"We can consider this as one of those suicide mission type tactics,\" she said. \"If Iran were to go that far, the retaliatory implications would be very costly and also would counter Iran's own interests with respect to its oil export capabilities as well as its relationships with the Gulf ... and its oil trade relationship with China.\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday called on Beijing to help prevent Iran from closing the strait. On Sunday, Iran's state-run Press TV reported that Iran's parliament, the Majlis, approved a plan to close the Strait of Hormuz but added the final decision would be with the Supreme National Security Council.",
      "Oil analysts predict prices could jump 50-60% if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. One barrel of oil is currently trading in the $70 per barrel range. That could jump to $120. Whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, releases more oil to compensate would determine the length of any possible price shock.",
      "\"Even if it's for a short term and the Strait of Hormuz is subsequently reopened or Iran doesn't maintain that level of threat for a prolonged amount of time,\" said Ozcelik. \"Iran still would suffer the consequences of that potentially, both in terms of its status, its reliability with the Gulf, as well as the oil infrastructure in the region, which has implications for Iran's own sanction-busting oil trade.\"",
      "Terrorist and cyber attacks",
      "Ozcelik said the real long-term protracted threat lies in \"the asymmetric warfare space and potentially state-sponsored terrorism.\"",
      "On Sunday, the U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System warned of a \"heightened threat environment\" in the country. The bulletin did not cite any specific threats but said \"low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against US networks.\"",
      "The warning came after a pro-Iran hacktivist group, known as \"313 Team,\" claimed credit for a short-lived outage of President Trump's Truth Social messaging platform on Saturday. At about 8 p.m. ET, users who attempted to log in received an error message that said \"Network failed\" and \"Please try again.\" The platform is back up and running.",
      "Around the world, Iran has been implicated in attempted terrorist attacks. Most recently, in London in May, British authorities arrested several Iranians they allege were planning a terror plot targeting the Israeli embassy.\u00a0 In 2023, also in London, an Iranian plot to kill two Iranian news anchors critical of the regime was also foiled. Other terror plots have been stopped in Cyprus, Germany, Turkey, the United States, Denmark, Belgium and France within the past decade.",
      "Any retaliatory action by Iran, whether it's direct attacks on U.S. assets or closing the strait, would invite a response from the U.S., the Trump administration has warned, which could put the Iranian government's survival at risk.",
      "Mr. Trump, after announcing the attacks on Saturday night, warned Iran against any retaliation, saying, \"There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 Israel said it carried out more strikes on Iran on Monday, targeting missile, satellite and radar sites two days after the President Trump ordered American warplanes to join Israel in attacking the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities, fueling concern around the world of an escalating conflict in the heart of the Middle East with the potential to draw in major world powers.",
      "Those concerns may continue to mount, as both Mr. Trump and Israeli officials hint at hopes that the military operations could result in the fall of Iran's theocratic rulers, and as Iran's top diplomat visits Russia looking for support from a key ally. Israel is also expanding its list of targets in Iran to hit sites linked directly to the ruling theocracy's grip on power domestically.",
      "The office of Israel's defense minister said Monday that the military was \"attacking with unprecedented force regime targets and government repression entities in the heart of Iran.\" It was the first time Israel has acknowledged striking targets linked to the Iranian regime's domestic authority, rather than its military or nuclear assets.",
      "The defense minister's office said the new targets included the notorious Evin Prison, where political prisoners are held, a clock in Tehran's Palestine Square that symbolically displays a countdown to the destruction of the state of Israel, and the headquarters of Iran's Basij paramilitary forces, which among other things acts as a morality police force for the Islamic rulers.",
      "\"For every shot fired at the Israeli home front, the Iranian dictator will be punished and the attacks will continue with full force,\" the defense minister's office said.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said earlier Monday that Israeli warplanes had also struck six airports in Iran, \"as part of the effort to expand air superiority over Iranian skies,\" targeting runways, various aircraft and underground hangers.",
      "Iran also launched a new wave of missiles at Israel on Monday, sending people to bomb shelters across the country. Dozens of missiles were reportedly launched at Israel, with impacts in at least two sites in the northern port city of Haifa and on a road in the southern city of Ashdod.",
      "Israel Electric Corporation said that, following a strike near one of its strategic facilities in southern Israel, there was disruption in the supply of electricity to a number of communities in the area.",
      "The attacks came after U.S. B2 bombers attacked three of Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend \u2013 the first direct U.S. military action against Iran after a week of Israeli attacks.",
      "Iranian nuclear sites \"totally obliterated\" by U.S. strikes?",
      "President Trump said in a televised address on Sunday that Iran's highly fortified Fordo nuclear enrichment site, along with the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities, had been \"completely and totally obliterated\" by the U.S. strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, said during a news conference, noting that a full assessment of the damage would take time.",
      "But while Mr. Trump said in a social media post that the \"spectacular military success\" in Iran had taken \"the 'bomb' right out of their hands,\" The New York Times reported that the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, believed Iran could have moved at least some of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to another location before the U.S. attack, as Iranian officials have claimed.",
      "In remarks to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi did not mention that prospect specifically, but he said \"no one \u2014 including the IAEA \u2014 is in a position to assess the underground damage\" at\u00a0Iran's most sensitive site at Fordo, where the regime is believed to have carried out advanced enrichment work in secret.",
      "\"We must return to the negotiating table and allow the IAEA inspectors, the guardians of the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty], to go back to Iran's nuclear sites and account for the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%,\" Grossi said, referring to the bulk of Iran's highly-enriched uranium, previously known to have been stored at the Isfahan facility. Uranium enriched to that level is only a short technical step away from the 90% purity required to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"We have a window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy. If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall,\" Grossi warned the delegations at the U.N.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" it would take days to confirm whether Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved, but he thought it was unlikely.",
      "\"No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it, because you really can't move anything right now. They can't move anything right now inside Iran. The minute a truck starts driving anywhere the Israelis have seen it, and targeted it and taken it out. So our assessment is, we have to assume that \u2014 that's a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there at Isfahan. And that really is key. What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over. Multiple countries in the world will take it and down-blend it. That's what they should do with that,\" Rubio said, adding another call for Iran to agree to abandon its enrichment work to end the crisis.",
      "Rubio said if Iran were to \"call right now, and say 'we wanna meet, let's talk about this,' we're prepared to do that. The president's made that clear from the very beginning. His preference is to deal with this issue diplomatically.\"",
      "Trump hints at prospect of regime change in Iran",
      "Rubio also reiterated on Sunday President Trump's previous statements that the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites were carried out with the sole purpose of removing the threat of the regime obtaining a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"It was not attack on Iran. It was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move,\" Rubio said.",
      "Mr. Trump had, right after the U.S. strikes, said they would be the extent of America's involvement in the conflict unless Iran launched retaliatory attacks against U.S. assets in the region. But late on Sunday, in a social media post, Mr. Trump stoked concern about a possible further escalation of the conflict.",
      "\"If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked about the president's remarks on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump \"was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking: If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks \u2014 we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know \u2014 but if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night. But as far as far as our military posture, it has not been changed.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his top aids have also suggested in recent days that the military action taken by Israel could make room for an uprising in the Islamic Republic to topple Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime, and Netanyahu has called directly on Iranians to take to the streets.",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that Iran \"reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.\"",

    "summary": "As U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities drive fears of retaliation, it remains to be seen whether Iran will try to block oil trade via the Strait of Hormuz.",
    "story": [
      "The United States launched military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities Sunday morning local time, an action President Trump said aimed to neutralize a threat \"posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror.\" It was widely seen as a turning point in America's involvement in the ongoing Middle East conflicts as the first direct intervention by U.S. forces in the war between Israel and Iran.",
      "The strikes have ignited concerns about possible Iranian retaliation and what form such responses could take. Among them are fears Iran could block oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial trade passage that the country partly controls.",
      "What is the Strait of Hormuz, and why is it important?",
      "Located between Oman and Iran, the Strait of Hormuz connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea and at its narrowest point, it is just 21 miles wide. The water, a crucial piece of global trade infrastructure, facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products per day, according to the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Iran controls the northern side of the strait, which runs along its border, and Oman and the United Arab Emirates control the southern side.",
      "Because of that, the strait has become one of the most vital oil \"chokepoints\" in the world, U.S. energy officials say. An analysis released last week by the EIA defined chokepoints as \"narrow channels along widely used global sea routes that are critical to global energy security,\" which can raise shipping costs and cause supply delays if passage through them is disrupted.",
      "Iran has long used the threat of closing the strait as a way to ward off Western pressure.",
      "Which products pass through the Strait?",
      "In 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, more than a quarter of global maritime oil trade flowed through the Strait of Hormuz, equaling about one-fifth of oil and petroleum consumption worldwide, according to the EIA.",
      "The agency estimated roughly 20 million barrels of oil have transited the strait daily since at least 2020, with tanker tracking data indicating close to 40% of the barrels last year were exported from Saudi Arabia \u2014 the most of any country. Along with crude oil and petroleum products, the strait also allowed for about one-fifth of the world's liquefied natural gas trade in 2024, which primarily came from Qatar, the EIA said.",
      "Both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have oil pipelines that, to an extent, could serve as alternative trade routes should the Strait of Hormuz become compromised, but their relative capacities would be limited. The EIA noted that disruptions to oil flow through the strait would severely impact a few markets, such as China, India, Japan and South Korea, which imported a majority of the oil and gas that transited it in 2024. In the U.S., the agency reported that oil imports through the Strait of Hormuz only accounted for 7% of the country's total oil imports and 2% of its liquid petroleum consumption over the same period.",
      "However, officials warn that any interference with oil flows through the strait could broadly upset international energy markets and economies, by stifling supply and possibly driving up oil and gas prices.",
      "\"A suicidal move\"",
      "Speaking about what Iran might do next, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that an Iranian effort to block the strait \"would be a suicidal move,\" likely driving backlash from a sizable group of powerful countries that would be impacted by that kind of decision.",
      "\"If they do that, the first people that should be angry about it are the Chinese government, because a lot of their oil comes through there,\" Rubio said, when asked about the possibility of Iran mining or otherwise preventing movement through the strait. \"Mining\" entails placing naval mines \u2014 which are explosives \u2014 in the water to damage vessels trying to pass.",
      "If that were to happen, Rubio said China would \"pay a huge price,\" as would \"every other country in the world,\" including the U.S.",
      "\"It will have some impact on us. It will have a lot more impact on the rest of the world,\" he said, hypothetically, of the consequences. \"It would be a suicidal move on their part because, I think, the world would come against them if they did that.\"",
      "The U.S., with its 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain, has long pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.",

      "The first images from a new telescope in Chile were released this week, featuring extraordinarily detailed scenes from deep space. And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world.",
      "More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies.",
      "One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula \u2014 both several thousand light-years from Earth \u2014 glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops.",
      "The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible.",
      "Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies.",
      "The team also released a video dubbed the \"cosmic treasure chest,\" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more.",
      "\"The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,\" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.",
      "Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system.",
      "Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision.",

Rubin Observatory\n\n#CaptureTheCosmos #RubinFirstLook",
      "Elana Urbach, a commissioning scientist on the project, told CBS News partner BBC News\u00a0that one of the observatory's main goals is to \"understand the history of the universe.\" That would mean having the ability to see galaxies or supernova explosions that occurred billions of years ago, according to BBC News.",
      "\"So, we really need very sharp images,\" Urbach said.",
      "The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, \"really far away ... means they come from earlier times.\"",
      "The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter \u2014 a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies.",
      "Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown.",
      "The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids.",
      "In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects \u2014 all of which pose no threat.",
      "For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year.",
      "Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system.",

      "\"Diddy testifying would just allow the prosecution to retell their case and put the previous items of evidence in front of the jury for a second or third time,\" Pointer explained. \"The prosecution would have a field day going through each and every video, text and witness statement made at trial against him and force Diddy to admit the authenticity of the videos, the receipts and invoices, items recovered at his homes and hotel rooms, and that he was present during the events described in prior testimony.",

      "The publication also points to previous research linking gum disease to other health risks, such as heart attack, stroke and cancer.",

      "To prevent dry mouth, AARP recommends sipping water regularly, rinsing the mouth after eating, asking your dentist about prescription-strength fluoride toothpaste, and using dry mouth rinses like Biotene or Act.",
      "3. Personalize your dental visits",
      "Contrary to the standard six-month checkup rule, AARP notes that dental care schedules should be personalized.",
      "One doctor in the report noted that there\u2019s \"nothing magical about a six-month checkup\" \u2014 some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits.",

      "4. Explore options for financial help",
      "Only three in 10 adults over 65 have dental insurance, per the American Dental Association, and Medicare typically doesn\u2019t cover cleanings, fillings or other routine procedures.",
      "Many common medications can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to decay, experts say. (iStock)",

      "AARP suggests looking into dental savings plans, local dental schools or sliding-scale community clinics if coverage is an issue.",
      "5. Adopt healthy habits",
      "Smoking is a major contributor to tooth loss.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all their teeth than non-smokers.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all of their teeth than non-smokers. (iStock)",

      "Switching to sugar-free gum or candies containing xylitol may help prevent cavities and support better oral health, Akosa told AARP.",
      "6. Restore appearance",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions about aging and dental health is that worn, discolored teeth are something to simply accept, according to Frey.",
      "\"It\u2019s not just about revitalizing the teeth \u2014 it\u2019s about revitalizing the person.\"",

      "Traditional vs. deep plane facelift",
      "With a standard or traditional facelift \u2014 also known as a SMAS facelift, or a Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System facelift \u2014 the surgeon makes incisions behind the hairline and around the front of the ear, lifting and tightening the deeper tissues and muscles and then removing excess skin.",

      "Risks and recovery",
      "Any elective or non-elective surgery carries some degree of risk, experts agree.",

      "THIS DAILY BEAUTY ROUTINE COULD BE RUINING YOUR HAIR, EXPERTS WARN",
      "It is important that the surgeon goes over these risks with the patient in person, according to Davis.",

      "Kepler's Forerunner K2 is a notable step up from its predecessor, the K1, thanks to extensive improvements in both hardware and software. The K2 features a reinforced limb structure for greater durability and easier maintenance, tactile manipulators with an impressive 11 degrees of freedom per hand, and flexible fingertip sensors that boost its dexterity. Its integrated battery allows for up to eight hours of continuous operation, supporting the long shifts required in industrial settings.",
      "On the intelligence side, the K2 leverages a cloud-based cognitive system that enables it to learn new tasks quickly and coordinate its movements with full-body awareness. Enhanced perception, task planning, and improved human-robot interaction algorithms allow the K2 to operate independently while collaborating smoothly with human coworkers.",

      "Kepler's K2 and the future of humanoid robots in industry",
      "Kepler's ambitions for its humanoid robots extend far beyond automotive manufacturing. The company envisions these robots playing active roles in education, research, security, logistics, and hazardous outdoor operations. In classrooms, the K2 can support interactive learning and real-time coaching, while in research labs, it can help with data gathering and experimental tasks.",
      "For security applications, the robot's advanced sensors enable it to patrol complex areas, detect emergencies, and assist in rescue operations. In logistics, the K2 is designed to automate goods handling and warehouse management, increasing both accuracy and efficiency.",
      "Its robust design, waterproofing, and resistance to extreme temperatures make it suitable for challenging environments, including areas with radiation or explosive hazards. The K2's autonomous navigation and real-time monitoring capabilities help reduce risks and boost productivity, especially in high-risk conditions.",

      "CHINESE HUMANOID ROBOT WITH EAGLE EYE VISION AND POWERFUL AI",
      "What Sets the K2 Apart",
      "The Forerunner K2 stands out for its precision, endurance, and adaptability. With advanced manipulators and flexible sensors, the robot can handle delicate and complex tasks that require a human-like touch. Its eight-hour battery life supports continuous operation during long industrial shifts, and its learning algorithms enable it to adapt to new tasks and environments with minimal retraining.",
      "Kepler also emphasizes the cost efficiency of the K2, stating that it can match or exceed the workload of multiple human workers in certain scenarios, making it a practical addition to high-demand workplaces. The company has set the base price for the Forerunner K2 at around $30,000, positioning it as an accessible option for manufacturers seeking to boost productivity and efficiency with intelligent robotics.",
      "Forerunner K2 \"Bumblebee\" humanoid robot at the SAIC-GM automotive plant. (Kepler Robotics)",
      "Addressing concerns about job displacement",
      "The introduction of advanced humanoid robots like Kepler's K2 naturally raises questions about the future of human employment in manufacturing and other industries. It's true that automation and robotics have the potential to change the way work is organized on the factory floor. Some worry that robots could replace jobs traditionally held by people, especially in roles that involve repetitive or physically demanding tasks.",
      "However, experts and industry leaders point out that the story is more nuanced. While certain jobs may be automated, new opportunities often emerge alongside technological advancements. For example, the rise of robotics is expected to create roles in robot maintenance, programming, AI training, and oversight, jobs that require different skills but are essential to supporting and managing these new systems. Many analysts believe that robots like the K2 are likely to complement human workers by taking over monotonous or hazardous duties, which allows people to focus on more complex, creative, or supervisory tasks.",
      "Collaborative robots, or \"cobots,\" are specifically designed to work alongside humans, enhancing productivity and safety rather than simply replacing labor. This collaborative approach can lead to new forms of teamwork and innovation on the factory floor, making work environments safer and more efficient. Ultimately, the integration of humanoid robots is expected to shift the workforce rather than eliminate it, opening up new possibilities for both businesses and employees as they adapt to a more automated future.",

Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0 If you're receiving password reset emails from accounts you don't remember signing up for, or from multiple services, there's a good chance your personal information is exposed on data broker sites. These companies collect and sell your data, including your email, phone number, home address and even login information from old accounts. Using a reputable data removal service can help you automatically identify and request the removal of your personal data from these sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft, credential stuffing, phishing and spam.",

When 2FA is active, anyone trying to log in must also complete a second verification step, usually through an app on your phone. If an attacker triggers a login attempt, you will receive a prompt to approve or deny it. This gives you the power to block the attempt in real time and confirms that 2FA is working as intended.",

      "7. Use a VPN to protect your online activity: Avoid public Wi-Fi or use a VPN to protect your information when browsing on unsecured networks. Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It's easy to brush off an unexpected password reset message, especially if nothing else seems out of place. But these alerts are often the digital equivalent of a knock at the door when you weren't expecting anyone. Whether it's a hacker probing for a way in or a scammer trying to bait you, the smartest move is to treat every unexpected security message as a wake-up call. Taking just a few minutes to check your login history, secure your accounts and update your passwords can make all the difference. Cybersecurity isn't just for experts anymore. It's an integral part of everyday life. And the more proactive you are now, the less likely you'll be dealing with damage control later.",

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices after a 'massive security gap.'",
      "Cyberattacks on financial service providers are no longer isolated events. In recent years, tax preparation companies, accounting software vendors and data brokers have all found themselves in the crosshairs of increasingly aggressive ransomware gangs. These attacks don\u2019t just disrupt operations but also expose deeply personal financial information that can fuel identity theft, fraud and long-term reputational damage.",
      "Now, Optima Tax Relief, one of the most prominent tax resolution firms in the U.S., has joined that growing list. A ransomware group called Chaos claims to have breached Optima\u2019s systems, stealing 69 GB of data before encrypting internal servers.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from Optima data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Optima breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Optima data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Optima data breach might have revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. To report identity theft, visit the FTC\u2019s\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov.",
      "3. \u00a0Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Optima hackers might have obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian or TransUnion \u2014 and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Optima hackers most likely have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Optima breach is not an isolated event, but part of a larger failure to adapt to the sophistication of modern ransomware groups. When companies with access to tax and identity data are compromised, it\u2019s not just an internal issue; it becomes a national one. For an industry built on trust, breaches like this erode public confidence in systems that are already strained. Attacks like these raise fresh concerns about the cybersecurity preparedness of companies that handle tax and financial data. Unlike login credentials or email addresses, stolen tax information cannot be easily reset. For victims, the consequences of such a breach could stretch across years.",

    "summary": "The power behind AI tools requires massive energy, and global data centers are expected to triple electricity usage by 2030 despite tech companies&apos; renewable pledges.",
    "story": [
      "A growing number of fire departments across the country are turning to artificial intelligence to help detect and respond to wildfires more quickly.",
      "Every time you ask ChatGPT a question, to generate an image or let artificial intelligence summarize your email, something big is happening behind the scenes. Not on your device, but in sprawling data centers filled with servers, GPUs and cooling systems that require massive amounts of electricity.",
      "The modern AI boom is pushing our power grid to its limits. ChatGPT alone processes roughly 1 billion queries per day, each requiring data center resources far beyond what\u2019s on your device.",
      "In fact, the energy needed to support artificial intelligence is rising so quickly that it has already delayed the retirement of several coal plants in the U.S., with more delays expected. Some experts warn that the AI arms race is outpacing the infrastructure meant to support it. Others argue it could spark long-overdue clean energy innovation.",
      "AI isn't just reshaping apps and search engines. It's also reshaping how we build, fuel and regulate the digital world. The race to scale up AI capabilities is accelerating faster than most infrastructure can handle, and energy is becoming the next major bottleneck.",
      "TRUMP'S NUCLEAR STRATEGY TAKES SHAPE AS FORMER MANHATTAN PROJECT SITE POWERS UP FOR AI RACE AGAINST CHINA",

      "ChatGPT on a computer\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI uses so much power, and what drives the demand",
      "Running artificial intelligence at scale requires enormous computational power. Unlike traditional internet activity, which mostly involves pulling up stored information, AI tools perform intensive real-time processing. Whether training massive language models or responding to user prompts, AI systems rely on specialized hardware like GPUs (graphics processing unit) that consume far more power than legacy servers. GPUs are designed to handle many calculations in parallel, which is perfect for the matrix-heavy workloads that power generative AI and deep learning systems.",
      "To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.",
      "On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the \"mixture of experts\" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.",
      "How much power are we talking about?",
      "In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.",
      "To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.",
      "Data center\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN",
      "AI\u2019s energy demand is outpacing the power grid",
      "The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100\u2013500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.",
      "To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.",
      "Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.",
      "Power grid facility\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can big tech keep its green energy promises?",
      "Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.",
      "These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.",
      "However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.",
      "Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas.\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Google and\u00a0Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren\u2019t available.",
      "Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.",

      "AI CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND DEEPFAKE SCAMS ON THE RISE",
      "The future of clean energy for AI and its limits",
      "To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.",
      "While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.",
      "Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.",
      "Google recently activated a geothermal project in Nevada, but it only generates enough power for a few thousand homes. The next phase may be able to power a single data center by 2028. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue building sites that consume more power than entire citie.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST ONE CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Will AI help or harm the environment?",
      "This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.",
      "Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements \u2014 used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics \u2014 creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations. In some areas, communities are pushing back against land being rezoned for large-scale tech development.",
      "Rapid hardware turnover is also adding to the environmental toll. As AI systems evolve quickly, older GPUs and accelerators are replaced more frequently, creating significant electronic waste. Without strong recycling programs in place, much of this equipment ends up in landfills or is exported to developing countries.",
      "The question isn\u2019t just whether AI can become cleaner over time. It\u2019s whether we can scale the infrastructure needed to support it without falling back on fossil fuels. Meeting that challenge will require tighter collaboration between tech companies, utilities and policymakers. Some experts warn that AI could either help fight climate change or make it worse, and the outcome depends entirely on how we choose to power the future of computing.",
      "HOW TO LOWER YOUR CAR INSURANCE COSTS IN 2025",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "AI is revolutionizing how we work, but it is also transforming how we use energy. Data centers powering AI systems are becoming some of the world\u2019s largest electricity consumers. Tech companies are betting big on futuristic solutions, but the reality is that many fossil fuel plants are staying online longer just to meet AI\u2019s rising energy demand. Whether AI ends up helping or hurting the climate may depend on how quickly clean energy breakthroughs catch up and how honestly we measure progress.",

      "1. Avoid downloading apps from ads or unknown sources: Crocodilus often spreads through ads on social media platforms like Facebook. These ads promote apps that look like banking tools, e-commerce platforms or even crypto wallets. If you click and install one, you might be unknowingly downloading malware. Always search for apps directly on trusted platforms like the Google Play Store. Do not install anything from random links, especially those shared through ads, messages or unfamiliar websites.",
      "2. Avoid suspicious links and install strong antivirus protection: Crocodilus spreads through deceptive ads and fake app links. These can look like legitimate banking tools, crypto apps or browser updates. Clicking on them may quietly install malware that hijacks your contacts, monitors your screen or steals login credentials. To stay safe, avoid clicking on links from unknown sources, especially those that promise rewards or warn of urgent problems. Installing strong antivirus software on your Android device adds another layer of protection. It can scan downloads, block malicious behavior and warn you about phishing attempts before they become a bigger issue.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully before and after installation: Before you install an app, take a moment to look at the permissions it asks for. If a shopping app wants access to your contacts, messages or screen, that is a red flag. After installing, go to your phone settings and double-check what permissions the app actually has. Malware like Crocodilus relies on overreaching permissions to steal data and gain control. If anything seems unnecessary, revoke the access or uninstall the app entirely.",
      "4. Keep your Android device updated at all times: Security patches are released regularly to block known vulnerabilities. Crocodilus is designed to take advantage of outdated systems and bypass newer Android restrictions. By\u00a0updating your phone and apps regularly, you reduce the chances of malware slipping through. Set your device to install updates automatically when possible and check manually every so often if you are not sure.",
      "5. Consider using a data removal or monitoring service:\u00a0While not a direct defense against malware, data removal services can help minimize the damage if your information has already been leaked or sold. These services monitor your personal data on the dark web and offer guidance if your credentials have been compromised. In a case like Crocodilus, where malware may harvest and transmit banking info or crypto keys, knowing your data exposure early can help you act before scammers do.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "6. Turn on Google Play Protect: Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android phones that scans your apps for anything suspicious. To stay protected, make sure it\u2019s turned on. You can check this by opening the Play Store, tapping your profile icon and selecting Play Protect. From there, you can see if it's active and run a manual scan of all your installed apps. While it may not catch everything, especially threats from outside the Play Store, it\u2019s still an important first layer of defense against harmful apps like Crocodilus.",
      "7. Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts or urgent messages: One of the newer tricks Crocodilus uses is modifying your contact list. It can add fake entries that look like customer service numbers or bank helplines. So, if you receive a call from \"Bank Support,\" it might not be real. Always verify phone numbers through official websites or documents. The same applies to messages asking for personal details or urgent logins. When in doubt, do not respond or click any links. Contact your bank or service provider directly.",

      "Crocodilus is one of the most advanced Android banking Trojans seen so far. It spreads through social media ads, hides inside apps that look real and collects sensitive data like banking passwords and crypto seed phrases. It can also add fake contacts to your phone to trick you during scam calls. If you use Android, avoid downloading apps from links in ads or messages. Only install apps from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. Keep your phone updated, and be careful if something looks too good to be true because it probably is.",

      "How does ANYmal-D play badminton with humans?",
      "Badminton is a game that requires quick footwork, fast reactions, and precise hand-eye coordination. To give a robot a chance on the court, the\u00a0ETH Zurich team equipped ANYmal-D with four legs for stability and agility, a dynamic arm to swing the racket, and a stereo camera to track the shuttlecock. The robot uses a reinforcement learning-based controller, which allows it to predict and react to the shuttlecock's movement in real-time. ANYmal-D can move around the court, adjust its posture, and time its swings, keeping rallies going with human players for up to 10 shots.",
      "NO TENNIS PARTNER? NO WORRIES WITH THIS AI ROBOT",
      "The technology behind ANYmal-D's badminton skills",
      "ANYmal-D's stereo camera serves as its eyes, constantly monitoring the shuttlecock. The robot uses a \"perception noise model\" to compare what it sees with data from its training, helping it track the shuttlecock even when it moves unpredictably. The robot can pitch its body to keep the shuttlecock in view, mimicking how a human player might lean in for a tricky shot.",

To fight back, enable your phone carrier's spam call protection (AT&T ActiveArmor, Verizon Call Filter, or T-Mobile Scam Shield). You can also use third-party apps like RoboKiller, Hiya, or Truecaller to screen calls, block known scam numbers, and report suspicious callers.

      "1. Smarter protections against phone call scams",
      "Phone scammers are becoming increasingly creative, often attempting to trick people into changing device security settings or granting risky permissions during calls. Android's new\u00a0in-call protections add a layer of defense by blocking certain actions during calls with non-contacts. For example, you won't be able to disable Google Play Protect, sideload an app for the first time, or grant accessibility permissions while on a call with someone not in your contacts.

Everyone has seen both men and women that by looking at that person, you say, \u2018oh, I don\u2019t want to try that person, they'd be too much of a fight.' You've just won.

They\u2019ve likely hidden advanced centrifuges as well, because production oversight hasn\u2019t existed for years.\"",

      "The report calls for the destruction of all enrichment sites, the removal or seizure of enriched uranium, the dismantling of advanced centrifuges, and a permanent halt to weaponization efforts. It also demands unrestricted inspections, irreversible disarmament, and strict enforcement through snapback sanctions. FDD argues that anything less would leave Iran capable of rebuilding its nuclear program.",

      "\"Trump\u2019s doctrine of \u2018peace through strength\u2019 is in action,\" Yadlin said. \"Geopolitically, this changes the entire war \u2014 and sends a message to China, Russia, and others.\"",
      "But Yadlin also believes Iran's nuclear capabilities haven\u2019t been wiped out completely. \"There are two possible Iranian responses: retaliation and changing nuclear policy. Retaliation may come via terror attacks in the Gulf, or pressure through proxies like Hezbollah or the Houthis. But I think the more likely shift is in nuclear posture \u2014 perhaps withdrawing from the NPT.\"",
      "\"They\u2019re in a dilemma,\" Shein told Fox News Digital. \"They don\u2019t want to drag the U.S. further into military conflict, and they can\u2019t risk harming ties with Gulf neighbors. A military retaliation \u2014 like closing the Strait of Hormuz \u2014 would invite overwhelming force. Expelling inspectors or quitting the NPT [Non-Proliferation Treaty] may be their next moves.\"",

      "On Monday, Iran fired back at the U.S. with a strike on the American Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in what is already being seen as merely a face-saving gesture. Qatar said it had intercepted the Iranian missiles and condemned the attack, calling it a violation of its sovereignty.",
      "But even as Middle Eastern leaders were quick to criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s paradigm-shifting assault on Iran following 10 days of Israeli bombardment, the American strikes are likely to be accepted \u2014 and even privately cheered \u2014 by an Arab officialdom that has long seen Shia Iran as the primary threat to regional stability.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump in recent weeks directed the Pentagon to give him military options for destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump in recent weeks directed the Pentagon to give him military options for destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program as the president, frustrated with the pace of negotiations, leaned into taking action.",
      "Trump has said his foreign policy is about ending wars, not starting new ones, and he had believed he could cut a deal with Tehran \u2014 replacing the nuclear deal agreed to in 2015 under President Barack Obama, which Trump ended in 2018 \u2014 that would end Iran\u2019s path to creating a nuclear weapon.",
      "But by last month, Trump had begun to decide that talks were not progressing in a way that gave the Iranians credibility, Vice President JD Vance told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI think that he decided probably by mid-May that this process was not going anywhere, and so he decided to issue some private ultimatums to the Iranians,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd then eventually, of course, we decided to destroy the Fordo nuclear facility, and some of these other facilities, ourselves.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump had all but decided to go forward on the military plans presented to him. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, had briefed him on a range of options for Iran earlier this month at Camp David, the secluded presidential retreat in Maryland. One option was not to get involved at all. But at some point after that briefing Trump started leaning toward taking military action.",
      "It was only in the final days leading up to the strike that those plans grew more refined. Trump ultimately chose an option to use B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, the only platform capable of carrying the largest bunker buster bombs in the U.S. arsenal, the 30,000-pound GBU-57 known as a Massive Ordnance Penetrator, and drop them on nuclear sites in central Iran.",
      "That bomb had never before been used in combat, but it was key to the operation, and to at least part of the rationale for the U.S. taking action. One of Iran\u2019s most important nuclear sites, at Fordo, is built inside a mountain and has been believed to be protected from any bomb with the sole exception of the GBU-57. And though Israel does possess smaller bunker busters provided by the U.S., it is not believed to have either the GBU-57 or any plane capable of delivering it.",
      "Few people inside the administration knew that Trump was moving forward with the plan, administration officials said publicly after the strikes, especially after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Thursday that the president had decided he would give Iran up to two weeks to agree to a nuclear deal.",
      "The president has developed a reputation for changing his mind on military operations or other policy moves, even at the last minute. By telegraphing to Iran, the world and even the American public that he was content with giving Iran two more weeks, he gave himself some measure of political protection in case he wanted to change his mind just before the operation began.",
      "According to a senior White House official, at the time Leavitt released the statement, Trump had not yet made a final decision, but \u201chis instincts were to move forward.\u201d",
      "Even as the Pentagon was preparing for the strikes, the president was continuing to pursue diplomacy, mainly through his special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. As he weighed how to move forward, Trump was briefed daily on Israeli operations and the U.S.\u2019 own military options.",
      "On Friday, the day after Leavitt released the statement from him about giving Iran two weeks, Trump ordered the military plans to move forward, though he did not yet give the final go order. The operation was given a name, Midnight Hammer, and the Pentagon began to put the pieces into place.",
      "Covert movements",
      "Some B-2s were flown toward the Pacific as part of a diversionary tactic and a submarine that would also play a role, firing Tomahawk cruise missiles at one of the nuclear sites, was pre-positioned. U.S. Navy ships were prepared to continue with the kind of defensive operations they have been conducting since Israel began its campaign against Iran earlier this month.",
      "\u201cThis was a highly classified mission, with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,\u201d Caine said during a briefing at the Pentagon on Sunday morning.",
      "Also on Sunday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth acknowledged that the bulk of U.S. military forces deployed to the region were also not informed of the impending mission. Defense officials said forces in the region are now on high alert. On Monday, Iran said it had launched a missile strike against a U.S. base in Qatar.",
      "As the operation approached, advisers checked and double checked whether Trump still planned to move ahead with the strikes. On Saturday morning, Hegseth called Trump, who was at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, to confirm that the operation was still a go, and Trump informed the secretary that the Pentagon should move forward.",
      "Later Saturday, as Trump was flying on Marine One to an airport in New Jersey for his trip back to Washington, D.C., to meet with his national security team, Hegseth called again to get the president\u2019s final approval, a White House official told NBC News, confirming a detail first reported in The Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. Trump told him the strikes were a go, the official said.",
      "When Trump arrived back in Washington, he immediately went to the Situation Room to monitor the mission with his top advisers, including Vance, Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio, Caine, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Hegseth.",
      "Soon after, the first bombs began to drop, at about 6:40 p.m. Washington time, or 2:10 a.m. Iranian time. The lead B-2 dropped two GBU-57s at Fordo, the primary target of the mission, according to Pentagon officials. The bombers behind it then dropped their bombs, ultimately unleashing a total of 14 GBU-57 bombs on two of the nuclear sites, Fordo and Natanz. The submarine then launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at the third site, known as Isfahan.",
      "The operation was by most accounts a smoothly executed one in which no American was killed or injured and the known targets were all hit. The Pentagon used more than 125 aircraft in total, launching about 75 total weapons.",
      "Trump and Hegseth were quick to declare the mission a success. Trump posted on Truth Social that it was a \u201cvery successful attack.\u201d Hegseth on Sunday said that Trump had delivered \u201cthe final blow\u201d to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "But the final assessment of what the U.S. accomplished in Iran will take days or even weeks."

Power plants require the radioactive metal to be enriched to only 3%-5%, whereas 90% is required to build a nuclear warhead.",
      "Speaking to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said damage was visible at the Fordo and Natanz sites after American B-2 Spirit bombers dropped 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator munitions known as \u201cbunker busters\u201d on them and U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles hit infrastructure targets at Isfahan.",

He added that \u201centrances to tunnels used for the storage of enriched material appear to have been hit\u201d at Isfahan, as had buildings \u201crelated to the uranium conversion process.\u201d At Natanz, he said, the fuel enrichment plant had \u201cbeen hit again.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration and Israel appear confident they know the location of the highly enriched uranium. Speaking to CBS News' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d before Grossi made his assessment, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that he doubted Iran had been able to move the enriched the uranium and that \u201cwe have to assume that there\u2019s a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there in Isfahan.\u201d"

      "Among those who spoke more substantively about the issue was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who steered the focus to Trump if there were retaliation to the United States\u2019 strikes.",
      "\u201cObviously, the Trump Administration holds responsibility for what comes next and ensuring that our American troops and our personnel in the region are safe,\u201d Shapiro said Sunday on X. He made sure to condemn an Iranian possession of nuclear materials.",
      "\u201cI will say, with regard to the Iranian nuclear program, it was obviously very, very dangerous,\" Shapiro said. \"The idea that Iran, the world\u2019s largest sponsor of terror, would have a nuclear weapon, would not only destabilize the Middle East, but it would create risk for American interests at home and abroad. And so it is good if Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Newsom did post a message later Monday honoring the 205 California Guard members serving in the Middle East, including at bases in Qatar and Iraq. \u201cJen and I are praying for their safety \u2014 and for the safety of every American service member serving in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he wrote, referring to his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul outlined what she had done to assess potential threats in a video on social media. \u201cAs we know, New York is always a target,\u201d she said, noting that she convened her public safety team as soon as she heard of Trump\u2019s strike authorization. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has repeatedly railed against Trump on other occasions, had a measured response Saturday, writing on X that after an \"escalation in Iran, I\u2019m keeping a close eye in consultation with federal authorities and @ILStatePolice.\"",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear wrote at the time of the retaliatory attacks Monday, without specifying what he was referring to: \u201cI know things seem scary right now, but it\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Hug your kids, focus on the things you are grateful for, and take a break from the news when you need it. Keep the faith and remember, we\u2019ll get through this together.\u201d",

      "As Israeli bombs fell on Iran over the last two weeks, Mandy Ansari Jensen cycled between crying and praying and checking her phone every few minutes as she waited to hear from her father in Iran. After five sleepless nights, she finally confirmed he was alive.",
      "Jensen, who was raised in the U.S. after her parents fled Iran during the 1979 revolution, is one of many Iranians around the world who say they feel frozen in fear and heartbreak as they await updates from loved ones in the country amid the outbreak of war between Israel and Iran. The U.S. entered the conflict by bombing several Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday, and Iran on Monday retaliated with a symbolic strike on a U.S. military base in Qatar that caused no casualties.",

      "Many in the Iranian diaspora come from families who sought escape from the theocratic regime that took over in 1979 after the Iranian Revolution. As the conflict between Iran and Israel persists, some Iranians abroad are expressing renewed hope for regime change, while others worry about the consequences of foreign intervention.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian people have resisted oppression for decades. They\u2019ve risked everything to protest, organize, speak out,\u201d said Jensen, a content creator who now lives in New York City. \u201cIranians want a free Iran, but having our country bombed by world leaders who we know don\u2019t care about the safety of innocent civilians is not the way either. We are not pawns. We are people.\u201d",
      "Citing the \u201cexistential threat\u201d of Iran potentially producing nuclear weapons, Israel on June 12 launched a massive attack targeting the country\u2019s nuclear capabilities, military leadership and scientists, prompting Iran to fire its own missiles toward Israel. As of Monday, the Iranian Health Ministry reported that Israeli strikes have killed at least 400 people in Iran and injured 3,000. Iran\u2019s retaliatory strikes have killed at least 24 in Israel.",
      "Israel\u2019s attacks killed some of Iran\u2019s senior officials, leading to mixed reactions of celebration and fear among those who oppose Iran\u2019s widely unpopular regime.",
      "For Shirin Naseri, it\u2019s a \u201cbittersweet feeling\u201d to see an outside government weaken the Islamic Republic in ways the Iranian people have struggled to do from within. Naseri grew up in Tehran before immigrating to the United Kingdom at age 25 to escape the regime, which is led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "\u201cWe want the regime gone, but at the same time, we grieve even the slightest harm to innocent people, to our homeland,\u201d said Naseri, who added that Iranians are unwillingly caught in a conflict driven by Iran\u2019s regime, not its people. \u201cWe are like any other freedom-seeking people against war in all forms and at all levels \u2026 and yet we dare to hope something good might come out of it.\u201d",

      "Oil prices retreat as markets assess Iranian retaliatory strikes are unlikely to affect global supplies",
      "But that sense of hope is also mixed with some skepticism. Aside from the threat of bombs on civilians, Nikoo Nooryani, a Los Angeles-based Iranian American, said that many are also concerned about the potential for the regime to \u201chide under this cloak of national security\u201d as justification to crack down harder on political dissidents in Iran.",
      "\u201cHistorically, this has been the way that foreign collusion has played out. It\u2019s always stunted the Iranian people\u2019s liberation movements, as opposed to helping them,\u201d said Nooryani, who also has family in Iran. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s another big discussion point that gets missed when people are rallying for freeing Iran through bombing them. It\u2019s never been in the favor of the people.\u201d",
      "In 2022, the death of Mahsa Amini \u2014 a 22-year-old woman arrested by the morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly \u2014 triggered widespread protests led by women and young people across the country. This \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d movement, like in many past protests, led to brutal government retaliation, according to Human Rights Watch.",
      "Nooryani said that observers have often conflated the movement with a call for foreign assistance, which she worries is opening doors for outside actors like Israel and the U.S. to co-opt Iranian civil unrest for their own interests. At the core of it, she said, the focus is \u201cself-determination for the people of Iran.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening to see three governments, who are strongly opposed internally in their own countries, create this chaos for us all,\u201d Nooryani said, referring to Israel, Iran and the U.S.",
      "The conflict has also raised complicated feelings for the hundreds of thousands of Persian Jews, many whose families fled Iran amid fears of religious persecution after the revolution.",
      "Among them is Millie Efraim, who wrote on social media that it\u2019s hard to see people online advocating for \u201cIran to defend itself\u201d without acknowledging the suffering the regime has caused their own people.",
      "Efraim, who is Iranian American and Jewish, is living in Israel, where she said she\u2019s been among the thousands of people who have had to hide in bomb shelters as Iran continues its retaliatory attacks on Israel.",
      "While she believes \u201cIsrael alone cannot liberate the Iranian people,\u201d Efraim said she hopes the war will catalyze enough change to \u201cremove Khamenei and the Islamic regime for good.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am aware of the ugliness of war. I have friends in Iran who I am worried for, because there has been collateral damage even with precise strikes, and my biggest fear is some superficial negotiation that keeps Khamenei in power,\u201d Efraim said. \u201cFor the sake of Iranians and Jews around the world, both of whom have been targets of the Islamic regime and its proxies, we must seize this moment and make regime change.\u201d",
      "Human rights lawyer Gissou Nia, director of the Atlantic Council's Strategic Litigation Project, said that despite hopes for regime change, some of those calls fall into \u201ca little bit of fantasy thinking\u201d right now.",
      "Since the war broke out, she said, many Iranians must prioritize their own survival \u2014 as some are rationing food while others left their homes with nothing but blankets to sleep on \u2014 and are not necessarily empowered to take to the streets and topple the regime.",
      "\u201cAnd historically, regime change from the skies has not gone well. Particularly, any project that the U.S. has been involved in hasn\u2019t gone well,\u201d said Nia, who is Iranian American. \u201cSo I think at least among Iranians inside Iran, but also the diaspora, we\u2019re now starting to really think about what comes next, if something does come next.\u201d",
      "What she\u2019s also concerned about abroad, Nia said, are reports surrounding alleged terrorist sleeper cells in the U.S. giving rise to the type of racial profiling that proliferated after the 9/11 terror attacks.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that Iranians inside Iran have led successive protest movements to get rid of their regime,\u201d Nia said. \u201cThe Iranian people should not be conflated with a regime that is unelected and has been wielding power through oppression for decades.\u201d"

      "Oil prices jumped and stock futures slipped Sunday evening, indicating concern among investors about the possibility of economic fallout from the ongoing unrest in the Middle East following U.S. strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The major focus is on oil. Iran remains a major international oil supplier, and it also sits on the Strait of Hormuz, a heavily trafficked waterway in the Persian Gulf that is a key transit channel for about one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply.",
      "Concerns centered on whether Iran would begin limiting or shutting down access to the strait. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that closing the strait would be tantamount to \u201ceconomic suicide\u201d for Iran and called on China, Iran\u2019s top trading partner, to head off any attempt by Iran to affect traffic.",
      "U.S. and global oil benchmark prices opened up 4% Sunday evening, underscoring the concerns about what the conflict means for the world\u2019s oil supplies. Those gains had eased slightly by 9 p.m. Sunday. Oil prices already gained about 3% last week in the wake of Israel\u2019s initial strikes against Iranian targets and Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile attacks.",
      "Stocks also slid Sunday. S&P 500 futures contracts opened about 0.6% in the first hour of trading, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell about 250 points, or 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.7%. Like oil, they had pared those opening losses somewhat by 9 p.m. U.S. markets officially open at 9:30 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "\u201cShould oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz be affected, we could easily see $100 oil\u201d or an increase in U.S. gas prices by 75 cents per gallon, Andy Lipow, president of the consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, said in a note to clients Sunday.",
      "In a worst-case scenario in which oil prices rose to at least $120 a barrel, U.S. gas prices would increase as much as $1.25 per gallon, Lipow said.",
      "In a follow-up email, Lipow said that even if the strait does not officially close, any action by a tanker company to pre-emptively reduce its footprint there represents \u201da de facto supply disruption.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s state-owned media reported that Iran\u2019s parliament backed closing the strait \u2014 but that the final decision lies with Iran\u2019s national security council, according to the report.",
      "Any move by Iran to alter traffic in the strait could also hurt its own economy \u2014 particularly commerce with China.",
      "On Sunday, a department of the U.K. Royal Navy said it observed \u201celectronic interference in the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d At least two massive supertankers that had entered the strait were reported to have made U-turns. Marine tracking websites also showed the vessels turning about halfway through the strait.",
      "\u201cI encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil,\u201d Rubio said in an interview on Fox News. China is Iran\u2019s most important oil customer, and they maintain friendly relations.",
      "Iran may still be assessing the ultimate damage to its nuclear facilities as it contemplates its next move. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday that while it had confirmed that the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan sites had been hit, it was not immediately possible to assess the damage at the Fordo site.",
      "Until last week, U.S. stocks had been enjoying a substantial, if volatile, recovery from the lows following President Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs announcement in April. That momentum reversed after Israel announced last weekend it had struck key Iranian military and nuclear targets, prompting retaliatory missile strikes on Israeli targets by Iran.",

      "\u201cTrump\u2019s statement that this might be the only US attack or might begin a series of attacks brought us little certainty,\u201d the analysts added in a note to clients. \u201cMoreover, we do not see an obvious route to a political settlement to the military conflict, which makes us think the conflict, like the one in Gaza, could last longer than many investors think.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The final public poll suggests the potential for an upset in Tuesday\u2019s New York Democratic mayoral primary \u2014 an outcome that would be dramatic but that also might end up resolving nothing.",
      "The Emerson College/WPIX/The Hill survey shows former Gov. Andrew Cuomo leading state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani 36% to 34% in the initial first-choice count, with Mamdani eventually overtaking Cuomo after multiple rounds of ranked choice tabulation and winning the final tally 52% to 48%.",
      "But a few caveats are in order.",
      "First, public polls in the campaign have been sparse. Only Emerson and Marist University have been regularly conducting them. And Marist\u2019s final poll found a different result, with Cuomo up by double digits at both the start and the end of ranked choice tabulation. (More on the details of that survey below.)",
      "One of those polls may be a lot more accurate than the other, although there is room for both to be right, since Marist\u2019s was taken a week earlier, and the race could have shifted in that time.",
      "The composition of the electorate is uncertain, too. Both Emerson and Marist find that Cuomo has an advantage with voters who say they will cast ballots in person Tuesday, as opposed to taking part in early voting or voting by mail. But will those voters show up in the numbers pollsters expect? It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to talk about how crucial turnout is as a variable, but there it is.",
      "Moreover, ranked choice voting is still new to New York City; this is only the second mayoral contest since it was implemented. It\u2019s still uncommon elsewhere. So no polling outlet has a deep and well-established track record when it comes to measuring such races. That having been said, Emerson\u2019s final poll in the 2021 New York mayoral primary showed now-Mayor Eric Adams narrowly edging out Kathryn Garcia in the final ranked choice round, which almost perfectly matched the actual outcome.",
      "What are the biggest differences between the final public polls?",
      "Overall, Marist has Cuomo ahead of Mamdani 38% to 27% in the initial round and 55% to 45% after multiple ranked choice rounds. Emerson has Cuomo up 36% to 34% initially but Mamdani winning 52% to 48% after ranked choice tabulations.",
      "A significant difference between the two surveys: how the rivals perform among Black voters, who will comprise about a third of the electorate. Cuomo has enjoyed massive advantages over the rest of the field with those voters throughout the campaign, and that trend continues in Marist\u2019s poll, with Cuomo 52 points ahead of Mamdani heading into the final round of tabulation. But Emerson\u2019s poll shows Mamdani making late gains among Black voters and winning 38% of them in the final round against Cuomo.",
      "The other major difference involves a third candidate, city Comptroller Brad Lander. In both the Marist and the Emerson polls, he is the final non-Cuomo/Mamdani candidate remaining as the ranked choice eliminations progress. In both polls, when Lander is then eliminated, his supporters break more to Mamdani than to Cuomo.",
      "In Marist\u2019s poll, that is more of an incidental development, as Cuomo\u2019s lead over Mamdani is cut from 13 points to 10 points in the final round. But in Emerson\u2019s, the effect is dramatic and decisive, propelling Mamdani to a 4-point victory after having trailed Cuomo by a point in the previous round.",
      "That could be related to the timing of the two polls. Only Emerson\u2019s was conducted after Lander\u2019s high-profile arrest last week at an immigration court. That may well have boosted his baseline support, which is higher in the initial round in the Emerson poll (13%) than in the Marist poll (8%). Plus, Lander and Mamdani teamed up last week, with each asking their voters to include the other in their ballot rankings. That could explain why Mamdani gains so much in the Emerson poll once Lander is eliminated.",
      "When will we know the results?",
      "Don\u2019t expect to know the winner Tuesday, or until at least next Tuesday (probably). Most votes will be reported out Tuesday evening and overnight \u2014 but those will be only first-choice votes. And as long as they are postmarked by Tuesday, mail-in ballots can still be added in over the next week. It\u2019ll be next Tuesday when the city actually runs the ranked choice tabulations. And even then, if the race is exceptionally close, there could still be the possibility that provisional ballots would further shift the count.",
      "Meanwhile, even though New York is deeply blue, that won\u2019t necessarily decide the next mayor. New York\u2019s election laws make it possible \u2014 and easy \u2014 for candidates who lose primaries to turn around and run in the general election. All they need is a ballot line, which they can get by starting their own parties, which is actually not that hard to do.",
      "Cuomo has already done that, having launched the Fight and Deliver Party. Officially, his plan is to run as the Fight and Deliver nominee in addition to being the Democratic nominee, since in New York, candidates can also be nominated by multiple parties. But if Cuomo falls short to Mamdani, the temptation to take the fight to a wider general election audience would be enormous, given Mamdani\u2019s left-wing politics (he\u2019s a self-declared socialist) and history of inflammatory statements. Cuomo\u2019s father, Mario, did just that in his own mayoral campaign in 1977, running as the Liberal Party nominee after he fell to Ed Koch in the Democratic primary.",
      "Meanwhile, Mamdani will most likely have the option of running as the candidate of the Working Families Party, which has already encouraged voters to back him in the Democratic race. There\u2019s no love lost between Cuomo and the WFP, which has indicated it wouldn\u2019t give him its ballot line even if he were the Democratic nominee.",
      "Then there\u2019s the current mayor, Adams, who is already running in the general election on a ballot line of his own making, while Republicans are poised to nominate Curtis Sliwa. Jim Walden, a former federal prosecutor, is also mounting an independent bid.",
      "In other words, the waters are already crowded. For both Cuomo and Mamdani, narrowly losing the primary might prove to be nothing more than an invitation to keep going."

    "story": [
      "A Ryan Murphy production rarely arrives without controversy \u2014 and this time, the backlash involves a mis-sized Birkin bag.",
      "Murphy\u2019s production company this month unveiled camera test photos, and video, of the highly anticipated FX series \u201cAmerican Love Story\u201d about the tragic romance between John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy.",
      "The images from the show, which started filming in New York City this month and is set to be released in February, gave audiences their first look at how actors Sarah Pidgeon and Paul Kelly portray the \u201cit\u201d couple, who married in 1996 and died in a plane crash three years later.",
      "Only a handful of the costumes were previewed in the online teasers. But many people online appeared outraged by the depiction, calling the style choices a far cry from the iconic fashion that Bessette-Kennedy, who was a former publicist that worked for Calvin Klein, was known for.",
      "\u201cPure crime against fashion,\u201d a person wrote June 13 on Instagram. Another commented: \u201c1995 styling with 2025 offerings is INSANE work. Back to the drawing board, I beg.\u201d",
      "The criticism focused on Pidgeon\u2019s outfit in the photos. For some, the boxy brown coat, cropped trousers and empty No. 35 Birkin bag were a deviation from Bessette-Kennedy\u2019s signature stuffed-to-the-brim No. 40 designer bag and high-quality minimalist style that made her one of the most notable fashion icons of the 1990s. Other photos and a test video show Pidgeon in a faux leather jacket, a midi silk skirt and Converse.",
      "\u201cThe details matter here as she used her image to control the narrative,\u201d said Jack Sehnert, the vice president of international design at Steve Madden and creator of an Instagram account devoted to the style icon, @carolynbessette. \u201cThey could have rummaged eBay for a month or two to find references & originals to make recreations for Sarah.\u201d",
      "Others in the fashion world noticed, too. The Cut called the wardrobe choices fast-fashion knockoffs of the high designer style associated with Bessette-Kennedy, and questioned why it seems Murphy\u2019s team did not pull straight from fashion archives.",
      "Diet Prada, an Instagram account with 3.4 million followers that is known for calling out fashion brands, also posted about the images. In the comments, celebrity stylist Erica Cloud wrote, \u201call of this is a no,\u201d and Vogue contributing editor and stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson stressed that while the \u201csilhouettes look the same. \u2026 Zara is very different from vintage Calvin, Narciso, Jil. ... send help.\u201d",
      "Others fixated on Pidgeon\u2019s platinum blonde hair, which Bessette-Kennedy\u2019s colorist told NBC News looked more like a \u201cHalloween wig\u201d than his former client\u2019s signature neutral-warm \u201ctoffee\u201d blonde.",
      "\u201cIf they are using that white wig, that\u2019s not me. That\u2019s not a replica of my work,\u201d said Brad Johns, a celebrity colorist who took Bessette-Kennedy\u2019s natural light-brown hair to blonde with a \u201cchunking\u201d highlighting technique. \u201cIf she saw that hair color on TV, she would be swirling in heaven.\u201d",
      "A representative for Murphy and FX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The backlash prompted Murphy to clarify that the first looks were merely shot for lighting and color tests and do not represent the finalized costumes for either character. In a recent interview with Variety, he said the camera test images were released early to pre-empt paparazzi leaks and called the release a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I ever do something like that again, I have to put a warning label on the top of the caption, explaining to people what the process is,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "He added that the production is committed to nailing authenticity and has a dedicated 10-person \u201cstyle advisory board\u201d to help reference and source Bessette-Kennedy\u2019s wardrobe. The show also has Bessette\u2011Kennedy\u2019s items, including her iconic Prada boots, and it is crafting a replica of her 1996 wedding dress. He also said that in the test photos, Pidgeon was wearing a wig.",
      "Still, Murphy said he was surprised by the negative comments.",
      "\u201cThere were comments like, \u2018I hate that coat, Carolyn would never have worn that,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat was just a coat we threw on for color. People were writing, \u2018How dare you use the No. 35 Birkin bag? She wore a 40!\u2019 Yes, we have a 40, but we just threw on a bag from another costume department because that was the sound stage we were on.\u201d",
      "The stakes, however, remain high. Unlike other biopic subjects, Bessette-Kennedy did not write a memoir or frequently speak to the media, and her public life was meticulously curated like her clothing. Her image lives on almost exclusively through paparazzi photos \u2014 photos that have been dissected and cataloged for a generation of fashion aficionados.",
      "\u201cThe real issue here is that she wore too few outfits publicly over a very small period of time in the spotlight,\u201d Sehnert said in an email, noting that her clothing became her public identity because she did not speak to the media. \u201cHer image lives on so prominently that any outfits that were not direct recreations were bound to disappoint.\u201d",
      "The mythology around Bessette-Kennedy grew after she died in 1999 in a plane crash with JFK Jr. and her sister, elevating her from fashion \u201cit\u201d girl to America\u2019s Princess Diana. Today, social media accounts like Sehnert\u2019s, which boasts almost 64,000 followers, are dedicated to Bessette-Kennedy. In the era of \u201cquiet luxury,\u201d her minimalist, no-label style carries even great cultural weight.",
      "\u201cCarolyn, unlike her contemporary Lady Di, lives in our memory in a handful of classic outfits,\u201d Sehnert said. \u201cYou cannot simply exchange one camel coat with another here, because we only saw her in ONE.\u201d",
      "Sehnert said that because of Bessette-Kennedy\u2019s fashion influence, he thinks it\u2019s \u201cfantastic that any entirely new generation is placing her style on a pedestal\u201d and speaking out about the initial \u201cAmerican Love Story\u201d photos.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the public and press were not kind to [Bessette-Kennedy] during her short life, so at least she continues to garner respect in death,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fabulous to see the effort & careful curation of her wardrobe inspire so many 26 years later. For better or worse, her poise under intense scrutiny & wardrobe choices are her legacy.\u201d",
      "In an Instagram story after the stills were unveiled, JFK Jr.\u2019s nephew Jack Schlossberg did not weigh on the fashion choices and said the Kennedy family was not consulted on the series.",
      "\u201cLately, my news feed has been filled with pictures of my uncle, John F. Kennedy Jr., a great man,\u201d he said, according to Entertainment Weekly, which reported on the story Thursday before it disappeared from Schlossberg\u2019s feed. \u201cFor those wondering whether his family was ever consulted, or has anything to do with the new show being made about him, the answer is no, and there\u2019s really not much we can do.\u201d",
      "But the initial \u201cAmerican Love Story\u201d costume disappointment has not yet deterred fans or even some of the biggest Bessette-Kennedy admirers.",
      "Asked whether he still plans to watch the show, Sehnert said, \u201cOh, let\u2019s be real, absolutely!\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Beijing has been stepping up controls on rare earth exports, triggering global shortages and exposing industries\u2019 dependence on Chinese supply chains.",
      "However, over recent years, China itself has become reliant on rare earth supplies from an unexpected source: the relatively small and war-torn economy of Myanmar.",
      "More from CNBC",

      "Oil prices shed 3% as Iran-Israel ceasefire eases concerns over supply, Strait of Hormuz closure",
      "Anxiety, frustration and hope for Middle East residents as Trump brokers fragile ceasefire",
      "While China is the world\u2019s top producer of rare earths, it still imports raw materials containing the coveted metals from abroad.",
      "Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China\u2019s total rare earth imports last year, Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC.",
      "According to Chinese Customs data, Myanmar\u2019s rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018 and reached a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023.",
      "Baskaran added that the imports from Myanmar are also particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant in the earth\u2019s crust, elevating their value and scarcity.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",
      "The country has become a key source of two highly sought-after heavy rare earths, dysprosium and terbium, that play crucial roles in high-tech manufacturing, including in defense and the military, aerospace and renewables sectors.",
      "\u201cThis dynamic has given rise to a supply chain in which extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China,\u201d said Baskaran.",
      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",
      "\u201cYou started to see quite a rapid buildout of new IAC-type mines within Myanmar, essentially replacing the domestic Chinese production. There was a lot of Chinese business involvement in the development of these new IAC projects.\u201d",
      "The rare earths extracted by these IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of \u201crare earth oxides\u201d for further processing and refining, Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.",
      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s rare earth risks",
      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

      "Mulroney and Apollinaare, a musician, tied the knot on December 9, 2010. They share two children together: 17-year-old Mabel Ray Mulroney and 15-year-old Sally June Mulroney.",
      "In the documents, the \u201cChicago Fire\u201d star requested joint legal and physical custody of their daughters.",
      "He is also asking the court to terminate spousal support for Apollinaare and grant him spousal support, instead. Their division of assets and property will be determined at a later date.",
      "In addition to his daughters, Mulroney is a father to 26-year-old son Clyde Mulroney, whom he shares with ex-wife and actor Catherine Keener. The two actors were married from 1990 to 2007.",
      "Mulroney and Apollinaare appeared together on the Fox game show \u201cWe Are Family\u201d in February 2024, according to Entertainment Weekly. Apollinaare participated in the Season 1 finale of the show, which highlighted the singing talents of celebrity relatives as contestants guessed their true identities.",
      "In the episode, Apollinaare performed \u201cWill You Still Love Me Tomorrow\u201d by The Shirelles before her husband secretly joined her for a duet of \u201cIslands in the Stream\u201d by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers. Apollinaare\u2019s identity was revealed later in the episode when Mulroney came out on stage and sang with her again.",
      "Speaking about their time on the show, Mulroney told EW, \u201cIt was such an amazing phone call to get that the show reached out to us. They knew Prima\u2019s music and put together that we are this sort of secret couple even though we\u2019ve been together for 20 years. Kind of a stealth Hollywood couple. So it really works perfectly for this show.\u201d",

      "STARKE, Fla. \u2014 A man convicted of raping and killing a woman near a central Florida bar is scheduled to be executed Tuesday.",
      "Thomas Lee Gudinas, 51, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke, barring a last-day reprieve. He was convicted in the May 1994 killing of Michelle McGrath.",
      "Gudinas would be the seventh person put to death in Florida this year, with an eighth scheduled for next month. The state also executed six people in 2023, but only carried out one execution last year.",
      "A total of 23 men have been executed in the U.S. this year, with scheduled executions set to make 2025 the year with the most executions since 2015.",
      "Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second place with four each. Alabama has executed three people, Oklahoma has killed two, and Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana and Tennessee each have one. Mississippi is set to join the other states on Wednesday with its first execution since 2022.",
      "McGrath was last seen at a bar called Barbarella\u2019s shortly before 3 a.m. on May 24, 1994. Her body was found with evidence of serious trauma and sexual assault in an alley next to a nearby school several hours later.",
      "Gudinas had been at the same bar with friends the night before, but they all later testified that they had left without him. A school employee who found McGrath\u2019s body later identified Gudinas as a man who was fleeing the area shortly beforehand. Another woman also identified Gudinas as the person who chased her to her car the previous night and threatened to assault her.",
      "Gudinas was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995.",
      "Attorneys for Gudinas have filed appeals with the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The lawyers argue in their state filing that evidence related to \u201clifelong mental illnesses\u201d exempts Gudinas from being put to death. The Florida Supreme Court denied the appeals last week, ruling that the case law that shields intellectually disabled people from execution does not apply to individuals with other forms of mental illness or brain damage.",
      "Meanwhile, a federal filing argues that the Florida governor\u2019s unfettered discretion to sign death warrants violates death row inmates\u2019 constitutional rights to due process and has led to an arbitrary process for determining who lives and who dies. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet released its decision."

      "Lavender, a TV writer and producer, and Shores, who works in communications, tell TODAY.com they landed on the idea for what would become \u201cHappy Wife\u201d after what they describe as a \"meet-cute\" at their children\u2019s school.",
      "\u201cIn classic Atlanta fashion, we couldn\u2019t find a parking space, so my husband, my daughter and I blow in probably 10 minutes late,\u201d Shores says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Meredith\u2019s ever been 10 minutes late to anything in her life. She\u2019s there, her son is seated, my daughter sits down next to him, I\u2019m sweating.\u201d",
      "The kids had been tasked with completing a scavenger hunt while waiting for everyone to arrive, and Shores says she started panicking thinking her child wouldn\u2019t have enough time to find things.",
      "\u201cThen Meredith\u2019s son looks over at my daughter and says, \u2018You can copy off of me,\u2019 and Meredith and I just had a mom moment where we were like, \u2018Aww!\u2019 and we struck up a friendship through birthday parties and other things.\u201d",
      "It was at a book fair where Shores mustered up the strength to ask Lavender about her career in writing and producing for TV, and a few months later, she approached her with an idea for a book.",
      "\u201cI had an idea in mind, sort of loosely inspired by the way that we, at the time, were all obsessed with the Murdaugh murders,\u201d Shores says. \u201cAnd you could see the way that, in a small town in South Carolina, the way that lore and history and lineage in that community shapes a crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me, growing up in Winter Park, which has its own lore and its own kind of energy, I just couldn\u2019t stop picturing what would it would be like if that happened in Winter Park,\u201d she adds.",
      "Lavender says that after Shores pitched her the idea, her brain went into \u201chyperdrive.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it was just lightning in a bottle, you know? It\u2019s that moment in time where, like, right idea, right person and then right moment,\u201d Lavender says. \u201cSo I think for us, it was a really fun process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d crack each other up. We\u2019d text each other, she would send me, like, a copy of the chapter, and I would be reading, texting her, like, \u2018Ha ha, this line!\u2019 or, like, screengrabs of it,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd I think we both did that for each other all the way through.\u201d",
      "The pair wrote the book together over the course of a few months. Shores summarizes the book: \u201cA young woman falls in love with a man who is older than her and his friends don\u2019t approve of the courtship or the marriage, so she throws a party in the hopes of winning them over, and the morning after the party, he\u2019s missing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis book, too, is about choice. These are people who just keep choosing their choice, doing it. I think that\u2019s the fascinating thing,\u201d Shores adds.",
      "The authors hint at what may be coming after the release, including a possible TV adaptation (\"For me, obviously, it's a no-brainer,\" Lavender says) and potentially more books, including with characters from the Winter Park universe.",
      "Recalling when they found out Jenna had chosen their book, Shores and Lavender say there was a lot of squealing.",
      "\u201cTo have the opportunity to even have a book on a shelf somewhere, like, I\u2019ll be able to take my daughter to a bookstore and point at something and say, \u2018We made this. It\u2019s possible to make whatever you want,\u2019\u201d Shores says. \u201cAnd so for Jenna to see it and like it and to give it this extra platform is like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d",
      "Lavender adds, \u201cWhen you respect somebody and their body of work and the thing that they do, and then they respect your work back, it\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s done so many cool things in her career, and then the fact that, you know, her love of books is now creating the space for people to get a spotlight \u2014 it\u2019s so cool,\u201d Lavender says."

      "When two new bombshells, TJ and Andreina, enter the villa, the rest of the islanders are stoked to get to know them. Jeremiah is making efforts to bounce back after ending things with Huda, and his connection with Iris seems promising. Andreina catches his eye, though, and those feelings are mutual as the two continue to chat and share kisses. Jeremiah and Iris eventually agree that their connection isn\u2019t so strong anyway and decide to stay friends.",

      "As TJ chats up a few girls in the villa, some bright connections emerge. He hits it off with Iris, as well as Cierra, who is happily coupled with Nic \u2014 or so we thought.",
      "Though Cierra jives with TJ, she and Nic just slept together for the first time the night before. But, after a rowdy challenge earlier in the day that made clear Nic is attracted to Andreina, she\u2019s thinks her feelings may be stronger than his. She chats with Nic, seeking a bit of affirmation, but Nic doesn\u2019t exactly deliver. He likes Andreina too, he says, and wants to stay open.",
      "Meanwhile, there\u2019s little trouble with the rest of the islanders: Chelley and Ace, Hannah and Pepe, and Olandria and Taylor seem strong in their couples. Austin and Amaya are newly together, but Austin is concerned Amaya is coming on too strong. Huda, still single after the whole Jeremiah saga, sets her sights on TJ, though he tells her he\u2019s not feeling it.",

      "Duff Goldman is among the Food Network stars paying tribute to Anne Burrell after her death.",
      "Burrell, who hosted \u201cWorst Cooks in America\u201d on the cooking channel, died June 17 at her home in Brooklyn. She was 55.",
      "On June 19, Goldman shared a photo on Instagram posing with Burrell, using the caption to share an emotional message about their \u201ccomplex\u201d friendship over the years",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve written and re-written this post so many times in the past 24 hours and I just don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Goldman began his touching caption. \u201cAnne and I became friends in probably 2006. She was going through some stuff and I had heard that she was feeling it so on a trip to NYC from Baltimore I had made her a cake that said \u2018Don\u2019t let the bastards win.\u2019 She never did.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAce of Cakes\u201d star said that he and Burrell \u201chad a complex relationship,\u201d adding, \u201cI remember the last conversation we had before our paths drifted was a pretty feisty debate about the merits of catfish. I believe the words \u2018trash fish,\u2019 \u2018tastes like mud,\u2019 and \u2018cake boy\u2019 were used, haha.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnne and I always had a spirited and somewhat acerbic back and forth,\u201d Goldman continued, recalling his conversations with Burrell. \u201cI really never knew why our paths drifted but I always hoped that wherever she was, Anne was doing well and was finding some happiness.\u201d",
      "Goldman recalled that after his friendship with Burrell had drifted, he attended a gala in New York City with his wife and daughter. While he was entertaining his daughter in the lobby, he spotted Burrell, noting \u201cat this point we hadn\u2019t spoken in years.\u201d",
      "He added that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cgo into what we talked about but I will say that that conversation left my heart lifted and full of light, for it truly seemed to me that Anne really had found a measure of happiness and love.\u201d",
      "\u201cLife is tough, and we have to be tough to get through it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnne was as tough as they come, but when you got past the armor there was a depth of compassion and kindness that was absolutely beautiful. My heart sings when I think of the love and tranquility that it seems Anne had found recently, and her genuine smile for my daughter and me in that lobby are what makes this tragedy just a little more bearable.\u201d",
      "Goldman concluded his caption on a sentimental note addressed to Burrell, adding, \u201cAnne, wherever you are I hope they have slow moving rivers because when I get there, we\u2019ll get a couple of rods, a pint of chicken livers, and a sixer and I\u2019ll teach you how to catch and cook the best catfish you ever had. Rest up, chef.\u201d",
      "A representative for Burrell confirmed her death in a statement shared with TODAY.com June 17, remembering her as \u201can industry veteran and passionate teacher who prided herself on her work in the culinary world.\u201d",
      "The Fire Department of New York said emergency personnel responded to report of a cardiac arrest at her Brooklyn home, though an official cause of death has not been shared.",
      "Tributes poured in on social media in the wake of her death, including touching sentiments from fans who learned valuable cooking lessons from Burrell, as well as fellow Food Network stars and celebrity chefs, including Guy Fieri, Robert Irvine, Tyler Florence, Carla Hall and more.",
      "Bobby Flay penned a touching message about Burrell, writing that the \u201cgreatest gift I got from AB was turning me on to a world of Maine Coon Cats\u2026a gift that I\u2019ll have forever.\u201d",
      "Rachael Ray, who co-hosted several seasons of \u201cWorst Cooks in America\u201d alongside Burrell, also shared an emotional tribute on social media, writing that she and her husband were \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the news.",
      "\u201cAnne had great taste in music and in life \u2014 she was a force in the kitchen, in any room, in every life she touched,\u201d Ray wrote in part in her post. \u201cI\u2019ll miss her friendship deeply. Everyone whose life she touched will miss her. \u201c"

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 If Iran had hoped its neighbors would rise to its defense in the wake of unprecedented American and Israeli attacks, that moment may have passed.",
      "On Monday, Iran fired back at the U.S. with a strike on the American Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in what is already being seen as merely a face-saving gesture. Qatar said it had intercepted the Iranian missiles and condemned the attack, calling it a violation of its sovereignty.",
      "But even as Middle Eastern leaders were quick to criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s paradigm-shifting assault on Iran following 10 days of Israeli bombardment, the American strikes are likely to be accepted \u2014 and even privately cheered \u2014 by an Arab officialdom that has long seen Shia Iran as the primary threat to regional stability.",
      "\u201cThese countries are quietly delighted to see Iran cut down to size,\u201d said Firas Maksad, the managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at the Eurasia Group. \u201cBut the primary objective is to guard against blowback targeting them.\u201d",
      "Statements from the governments of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, for example, have stopped short of condemning the U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, instead only issuing expressions of concern over an expanding regional conflict.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump in recent weeks directed the Pentagon to give him military options for destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump in recent weeks directed the Pentagon to give him military options for destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program as the president, frustrated with the pace of negotiations, leaned into taking action.",
      "Trump has said his foreign policy is about ending wars, not starting new ones, and he had believed he could cut a deal with Tehran \u2014 replacing the nuclear deal agreed to in 2015 under President Barack Obama, which Trump ended in 2018 \u2014 that would end Iran\u2019s path to creating a nuclear weapon.",
      "But by last month, Trump had begun to decide that talks were not progressing in a way that gave the Iranians credibility, Vice President JD Vance told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI think that he decided probably by mid-May that this process was not going anywhere, and so he decided to issue some private ultimatums to the Iranians,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd then eventually, of course, we decided to destroy the Fordo nuclear facility, and some of these other facilities, ourselves.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump had all but decided to go forward on the military plans presented to him. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, had briefed him on a range of options for Iran earlier this month at Camp David, the secluded presidential retreat in Maryland. One option was not to get involved at all. But at some point after that briefing Trump started leaning toward taking military action.",
      "It was only in the final days leading up to the strike that those plans grew more refined. Trump ultimately chose an option to use B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, the only platform capable of carrying the largest bunker buster bombs in the U.S. arsenal, the 30,000-pound GBU-57 known as a Massive Ordnance Penetrator, and drop them on nuclear sites in central Iran.",
      "That bomb had never before been used in combat, but it was key to the operation, and to at least part of the rationale for the U.S. taking action. One of Iran\u2019s most important nuclear sites, at Fordo, is built inside a mountain and has been believed to be protected from any bomb with the sole exception of the GBU-57. And though Israel does possess smaller bunker busters provided by the U.S., it is not believed to have either the GBU-57 or any plane capable of delivering it.",
      "Few people inside the administration knew that Trump was moving forward with the plan, administration officials said publicly after the strikes, especially after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Thursday that the president had decided he would give Iran up to two weeks to agree to a nuclear deal.",
      "The president has developed a reputation for changing his mind on military operations or other policy moves, even at the last minute. By telegraphing to Iran, the world and even the American public that he was content with giving Iran two more weeks, he gave himself some measure of political protection in case he wanted to change his mind just before the operation began.",
      "According to a senior White House official, at the time Leavitt released the statement, Trump had not yet made a final decision, but \u201chis instincts were to move forward.\u201d",
      "Even as the Pentagon was preparing for the strikes, the president was continuing to pursue diplomacy, mainly through his special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. As he weighed how to move forward, Trump was briefed daily on Israeli operations and the U.S.\u2019 own military options.",
      "On Friday, the day after Leavitt released the statement from him about giving Iran two weeks, Trump ordered the military plans to move forward, though he did not yet give the final go order. The operation was given a name, Midnight Hammer, and the Pentagon began to put the pieces into place.",
      "Covert movements",
      "Some B-2s were flown toward the Pacific as part of a diversionary tactic and a submarine that would also play a role, firing Tomahawk cruise missiles at one of the nuclear sites, was pre-positioned. U.S. Navy ships were prepared to continue with the kind of defensive operations they have been conducting since Israel began its campaign against Iran earlier this month.",
      "\u201cThis was a highly classified mission, with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,\u201d Caine said during a briefing at the Pentagon on Sunday morning.",
      "Also on Sunday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth acknowledged that the bulk of U.S. military forces deployed to the region were also not informed of the impending mission. Defense officials said forces in the region are now on high alert. On Monday, Iran said it had launched a missile strike against a U.S. base in Qatar.",
      "As the operation approached, advisers checked and double checked whether Trump still planned to move ahead with the strikes. On Saturday morning, Hegseth called Trump, who was at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, to confirm that the operation was still a go, and Trump informed the secretary that the Pentagon should move forward.",
      "Later Saturday, as Trump was flying on Marine One to an airport in New Jersey for his trip back to Washington, D.C., to meet with his national security team, Hegseth called again to get the president\u2019s final approval, a White House official told NBC News, confirming a detail first reported in The Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. Trump told him the strikes were a go, the official said.",
      "When Trump arrived back in Washington, he immediately went to the Situation Room to monitor the mission with his top advisers, including Vance, Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio, Caine, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Hegseth.",
      "Soon after, the first bombs began to drop, at about 6:40 p.m. Washington time, or 2:10 a.m. Iranian time. The lead B-2 dropped two GBU-57s at Fordo, the primary target of the mission, according to Pentagon officials. The bombers behind it then dropped their bombs, ultimately unleashing a total of 14 GBU-57 bombs on two of the nuclear sites, Fordo and Natanz. The submarine then launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at the third site, known as Isfahan.",
      "The operation was by most accounts a smoothly executed one in which no American was killed or injured and the known targets were all hit. The Pentagon used more than 125 aircraft in total, launching about 75 total weapons.",
      "Trump and Hegseth were quick to declare the mission a success. Trump posted on Truth Social that it was a \u201cvery successful attack.\u201d Hegseth on Sunday said that Trump had delivered \u201cthe final blow\u201d to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "But the final assessment of what the U.S. accomplished in Iran will take days or even weeks."

      "But despite his bullish claims, the extent of the damage to the deeply buried facility at Fordo, as well as sites at Isfahan and Natanz, is unclear and almost 400 kilograms, or 880 pounds, of uranium enriched to 60% are publicly unaccounted for. Power plants require the radioactive metal to be enriched to only 3%-5%, whereas 90% is required to build a nuclear warhead.",
      "Speaking to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said damage was visible at the Fordo and Natanz sites after American B-2 Spirit bombers dropped 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator munitions known as \u201cbunker busters\u201d on them and U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles hit infrastructure targets at Isfahan.",
      "\u201cCraters are visible at the Fordo site, Iran\u2019s main location for enriching uranium to 60%,\u201d Grossi said. He added that \u201centrances to tunnels used for the storage of enriched material appear to have been hit\u201d at Isfahan, as had buildings \u201crelated to the uranium conversion process.\u201d At Natanz, he said, the fuel enrichment plant had \u201cbeen hit again.\u201d",
      "But he said that \u201cno one\u201d including his International Atomic Energy Agency, was \u201cin a position to assess the underground damage at Fordo,\u201d and he called for inspectors to be allowed back \u201cto Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and account for the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Israel appear confident they know the location of the highly enriched uranium. Speaking to CBS News' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d before Grossi made his assessment, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that he doubted Iran had been able to move the enriched the uranium and that \u201cwe have to assume that there\u2019s a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there in Isfahan.\u201d"

    "summary": "Members of Congress have been all over the map in their reactions, while many governors \u2014 seen as potential 2028 presidential candidates \u2014 have avoided weighing in on policy.",
    "story": [
      "They condemned. They sidestepped. They offered support.",
      "What Democrats didn\u2019t do in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to unilaterally greenlight military strikes on Iran was push a consistent, coherent message.",
      "In Congress, Democrats were all over the map on where they stood on Trump's action. At the gubernatorial level, where many potential 2028 Democratic contenders now sit \u2014 including those clamoring to be viewed as the front-line \"resistance\" \u2014 Democrats posted carefully curated messages that avoided getting into politics or even policy.",
      "With some exceptions, governors' comments were focused on the public safety of their states should Iran retaliate on American soil. That\u2019s even as Trump took Americans on a bruising roller coaster ride over the last several days, often contradicting his top aides as his posts on social media ricocheted from authorizing strikes to suggesting a regime change in Iran to antagonizing the nation to proclaiming peace.",
      "Over the weekend, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committed, noted that former President Joe Biden hadn't started any wars, pointing to Trump's promises to keep the country out of foreign conflicts.",
      "For three days, the Democratic National Committee attacked the Trump administration's actions and statements on Iran, saying on Monday \"it\u2019s clear his administration has no idea what they are doing \u2014 or even what their goal is.\"",
      "But on Tuesday, the DNC is set to hold a media call on a different topic \u2014 about  the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned abortion rights protections in Roe v. Wade. Senate Democrats are similarly marking the anniversary of the decision.",
      "The wide-ranging, disjointed responses from Democrats underscored the fluidity and volatility of a Middle East conflict that has raged since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. It also demonstrated how the leaderless minority party is struggling to collectively act as an antidote to a president many of them have repeatedly condemned as a threat to democracy.",
      "Congress",
      "On Capitol Hill, some Democrats have blasted the strikes as unwise and unconstitutional, like Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who are leading efforts to block him from further strikes. Others have hedged on the merits, demanding more information and saying Trump needs approval from Congress first, such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.",
      "And yet other pro-Israel Democrats say they support Trump's move, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland \u2014\u00a0although Hoyer also blamed Trump for getting the United States into this situation by reneging on the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.",
      "Kaine told NBC News he's \"nervous\" that the United States could make a mistake similar to the one it made with the Iraq War.",
      "\"In Iraq, we were misled into the war with intelligence about the Iraqi WMD [weapons of mass destruction] program that proved not to be accurate. And I'm very, very concerned about that here,\" Kaine said Monday.",
      "\"This isn't 'Should the tax rate be 22% or 23.5 %?' This is a real vote of conscience. Should the United States be in another war in the Middle East?\" he added.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who arrived in Congress in 1997 and voted against authorizing military force in Iraq in 2002, said he also saw parallels between the escalating Iran situation and how the George W. Bush administration made the case for the Iraq War.",
      "\"I remember how they cherry-picked information and fed it to members of Congress, but at least we had a debate,\" said McGovern, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, who is calling for a formal debate and vote on military action against Iran. \"It's easy to get into wars; it's hard as hell to get out.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she hopes Democrats can, at minimum, rally around the Kaine resolution to require approval from Congress before Trump can strike Iran.",
      "\"People can argue all they want about what the election of 2024 meant,\" Warren said. \"But the one thing I'm very sure about is that no one was voting to attack another nation and involve America's military in another war.\"",
      "But that unity isn't there. Jeffries declined to say Monday whether he supports the Khanna resolution to require Congress to sign off on military action in Iran, telling reporters, \u201cI haven\u2019t taken a look at it.\u201d",
      "And Fetterman, who urged Trump last week to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, pushed back against fellow Democrats who have labeled U.S. military involvement \u201cunconstitutional\u201d or who called for Trump to be impeached.",
      "\u201cIf you throw that word around \u2014 \u2018impeachment\u2019 \u2014 then you continue to cheapen what that word actually means,\u201d Fetterman told reporters Monday.",
      "\u201cI was the first guy in the Senate calling it to strike the nuclear facilities. Of course, I absolutely support that,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, I know that might cost me politically, but I fundamentally know that\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials will hold separate classified briefings on the situation in the Middle East on Tuesday afternoon for House and Senate members.",
      "Governors",
      "As sirens blared across Doha warning of incoming attacks on Qatar on Monday, the typically combative California Gov. Gavin Newsom fired off a message on social media condemning the Trump administration.",
      "It had nothing to do with Iran.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s America: The father of 3 U.S. Marines is brutally beaten by federal agents,\u201d Newsom said on X, speaking of an immigration arrest in his state that was caught on a viral video.",
      "Absent from Newsom\u2019s typically active and animated feed were any verbal shots at Trump\u2019s strikes on Iran, even though he is among the governors viewed as potential 2028 contenders who has repeatedly taken on Trump.",
      "But after one of the most consequential moves Trump has taken since he became commander in chief in January, he and other governors kept quiet about the United States\u2019 potentially entering a war.",
      "Aides to various governors said they tried to stay in their lanes \u2014 speaking specifically about how they were protecting their states from any potential retribution through violence or cyberattacks or by honoring National Guard members based in the Middle East. They stressed they weren\u2019t privy to intelligence that would have helped assess Trump\u2019s decision to order strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities; they couldn\u2019t even independently assess after the fact how much damage was actually done.",
      "Among those who spoke more substantively about the issue was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who steered the focus to Trump if there were retaliation to the United States\u2019 strikes.",
      "\u201cObviously, the Trump Administration holds responsibility for what comes next and ensuring that our American troops and our personnel in the region are safe,\u201d Shapiro said Sunday on X. He made sure to condemn an Iranian possession of nuclear materials.",
      "\u201cI will say, with regard to the Iranian nuclear program, it was obviously very, very dangerous,\" Shapiro said. \"The idea that Iran, the world\u2019s largest sponsor of terror, would have a nuclear weapon, would not only destabilize the Middle East, but it would create risk for American interests at home and abroad. And so it is good if Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Newsom did post a message later Monday honoring the 205 California Guard members serving in the Middle East, including at bases in Qatar and Iraq. \u201cJen and I are praying for their safety \u2014 and for the safety of every American service member serving in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he wrote, referring to his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul outlined what she had done to assess potential threats in a video on social media. \u201cAs we know, New York is always a target,\u201d she said, noting that she convened her public safety team as soon as she heard of Trump\u2019s strike authorization. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has repeatedly railed against Trump on other occasions, had a measured response Saturday, writing on X that after an \"escalation in Iran, I\u2019m keeping a close eye in consultation with federal authorities and @ILStatePolice.\"",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear wrote at the time of the retaliatory attacks Monday, without specifying what he was referring to: \u201cI know things seem scary right now, but it\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Hug your kids, focus on the things you are grateful for, and take a break from the news when you need it. Keep the faith and remember, we\u2019ll get through this together.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (June 23, 2025, 10:39 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstate who made the comments about Biden's not starting any foreign wars. It was Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., not the Democratic National Committee."

      "As Israeli bombs fell on Iran over the last two weeks, Mandy Ansari Jensen cycled between crying and praying and checking her phone every few minutes as she waited to hear from her father in Iran. After five sleepless nights, she finally confirmed he was alive.",
      "Jensen, who was raised in the U.S. after her parents fled Iran during the 1979 revolution, is one of many Iranians around the world who say they feel frozen in fear and heartbreak as they await updates from loved ones in the country amid the outbreak of war between Israel and Iran. The U.S. entered the conflict by bombing several Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday, and Iran on Monday retaliated with a symbolic strike on a U.S. military base in Qatar that caused no casualties.",
      "Follow live updates here",
      "Many in the Iranian diaspora come from families who sought escape from the theocratic regime that took over in 1979 after the Iranian Revolution. As the conflict between Iran and Israel persists, some Iranians abroad are expressing renewed hope for regime change, while others worry about the consequences of foreign intervention.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian people have resisted oppression for decades. They\u2019ve risked everything to protest, organize, speak out,\u201d said Jensen, a content creator who now lives in New York City. \u201cIranians want a free Iran, but having our country bombed by world leaders who we know don\u2019t care about the safety of innocent civilians is not the way either. We are not pawns. We are people.\u201d",
      "Citing the \u201cexistential threat\u201d of Iran potentially producing nuclear weapons, Israel on June 12 launched a massive attack targeting the country\u2019s nuclear capabilities, military leadership and scientists, prompting Iran to fire its own missiles toward Israel. As of Monday, the Iranian Health Ministry reported that Israeli strikes have killed at least 400 people in Iran and injured 3,000. Iran\u2019s retaliatory strikes have killed at least 24 in Israel.",
      "Israel\u2019s attacks killed some of Iran\u2019s senior officials, leading to mixed reactions of celebration and fear among those who oppose Iran\u2019s widely unpopular regime.",
      "For Shirin Naseri, it\u2019s a \u201cbittersweet feeling\u201d to see an outside government weaken the Islamic Republic in ways the Iranian people have struggled to do from within. Naseri grew up in Tehran before immigrating to the United Kingdom at age 25 to escape the regime, which is led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "\u201cWe want the regime gone, but at the same time, we grieve even the slightest harm to innocent people, to our homeland,\u201d said Naseri, who added that Iranians are unwillingly caught in a conflict driven by Iran\u2019s regime, not its people. \u201cWe are like any other freedom-seeking people against war in all forms and at all levels \u2026 and yet we dare to hope something good might come out of it.\u201d",

      "Oil prices retreat as markets assess Iranian retaliatory strikes are unlikely to affect global supplies",
      "But that sense of hope is also mixed with some skepticism. Aside from the threat of bombs on civilians, Nikoo Nooryani, a Los Angeles-based Iranian American, said that many are also concerned about the potential for the regime to \u201chide under this cloak of national security\u201d as justification to crack down harder on political dissidents in Iran.",
      "\u201cHistorically, this has been the way that foreign collusion has played out. It\u2019s always stunted the Iranian people\u2019s liberation movements, as opposed to helping them,\u201d said Nooryani, who also has family in Iran. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s another big discussion point that gets missed when people are rallying for freeing Iran through bombing them. It\u2019s never been in the favor of the people.\u201d",
      "In 2022, the death of Mahsa Amini \u2014 a 22-year-old woman arrested by the morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly \u2014 triggered widespread protests led by women and young people across the country. This \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d movement, like in many past protests, led to brutal government retaliation, according to Human Rights Watch.",
      "Nooryani said that observers have often conflated the movement with a call for foreign assistance, which she worries is opening doors for outside actors like Israel and the U.S. to co-opt Iranian civil unrest for their own interests. At the core of it, she said, the focus is \u201cself-determination for the people of Iran.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening to see three governments, who are strongly opposed internally in their own countries, create this chaos for us all,\u201d Nooryani said, referring to Israel, Iran and the U.S.",
      "The conflict has also raised complicated feelings for the hundreds of thousands of Persian Jews, many whose families fled Iran amid fears of religious persecution after the revolution.",
      "Among them is Millie Efraim, who wrote on social media that it\u2019s hard to see people online advocating for \u201cIran to defend itself\u201d without acknowledging the suffering the regime has caused their own people.",
      "Efraim, who is Iranian American and Jewish, is living in Israel, where she said she\u2019s been among the thousands of people who have had to hide in bomb shelters as Iran continues its retaliatory attacks on Israel.",
      "While she believes \u201cIsrael alone cannot liberate the Iranian people,\u201d Efraim said she hopes the war will catalyze enough change to \u201cremove Khamenei and the Islamic regime for good.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am aware of the ugliness of war. I have friends in Iran who I am worried for, because there has been collateral damage even with precise strikes, and my biggest fear is some superficial negotiation that keeps Khamenei in power,\u201d Efraim said. \u201cFor the sake of Iranians and Jews around the world, both of whom have been targets of the Islamic regime and its proxies, we must seize this moment and make regime change.\u201d",
      "Human rights lawyer Gissou Nia, director of the Atlantic Council's Strategic Litigation Project, said that despite hopes for regime change, some of those calls fall into \u201ca little bit of fantasy thinking\u201d right now.",
      "Since the war broke out, she said, many Iranians must prioritize their own survival \u2014 as some are rationing food while others left their homes with nothing but blankets to sleep on \u2014 and are not necessarily empowered to take to the streets and topple the regime.",
      "\u201cAnd historically, regime change from the skies has not gone well. Particularly, any project that the U.S. has been involved in hasn\u2019t gone well,\u201d said Nia, who is Iranian American. \u201cSo I think at least among Iranians inside Iran, but also the diaspora, we\u2019re now starting to really think about what comes next, if something does come next.\u201d",
      "What she\u2019s also concerned about abroad, Nia said, are reports surrounding alleged terrorist sleeper cells in the U.S. giving rise to the type of racial profiling that proliferated after the 9/11 terror attacks.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that Iranians inside Iran have led successive protest movements to get rid of their regime,\u201d Nia said. \u201cThe Iranian people should not be conflated with a regime that is unelected and has been wielding power through oppression for decades.\u201d"

      "Oil prices jumped and stock futures slipped Sunday evening, indicating concern among investors about the possibility of economic fallout from the ongoing unrest in the Middle East following U.S. strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The major focus is on oil. Iran remains a major international oil supplier, and it also sits on the Strait of Hormuz, a heavily trafficked waterway in the Persian Gulf that is a key transit channel for about one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply.",
      "Concerns centered on whether Iran would begin limiting or shutting down access to the strait. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that closing the strait would be tantamount to \u201ceconomic suicide\u201d for Iran and called on China, Iran\u2019s top trading partner, to head off any attempt by Iran to affect traffic.",
      "U.S. and global oil benchmark prices opened up 4% Sunday evening, underscoring the concerns about what the conflict means for the world\u2019s oil supplies. Those gains had eased slightly by 9 p.m. Sunday. Oil prices already gained about 3% last week in the wake of Israel\u2019s initial strikes against Iranian targets and Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile attacks.",

      "Distribution wouldn\u2019t open until the next morning, June 3, but the walk along a sea route, from Khan Younis, where they were sheltering in a tent, to Rafah, where the aid site was, would take hours. On the first day the distribution site opened, Zeidan had arrived at 9 a.m., too late to collect any food. Another day, she turned back when she heard there was gunfire near the site.",

      "The United Nations, which had previously run a network of hundreds of aid distribution points across Gaza but has since been sidelined by Israel, warned that reducing aid distribution to GHF\u2019s four sites would be chaotic, insufficient and dangerous. Since GHF began operations on May 26, more than 100 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while trying to reach its aid distribution sites, according to the local health ministry and witnesses.",

      "From navigating tough weather in Australia to being questioned by police in Egypt, Ian Andersen has faced many challenges in his journeys biking across continents and documenting them on social media.",
      "But the American creator, known as \u201cridewithian\u201d to his 43,300 followers on TikTok, never had war on his list of possible hurdles \u2014 until last week. Amid his 29-day trek across Iran, Andersen found himself stuck just after Israeli forces began a \u201cpre-emptive\u201d strike on the country.",
      "As Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks, visitors like Andersen have scrambled to find ways to safely exit the Middle East. He was among several people to document how he was able to depart the country, and he shared his journey with followers.",
      "Andersen said that at first, he was determined to continue his Iran trip \u201cas intended.\u201d But then his guide, Reza, told him something that made him change course. \u201cI can no longer protect you,\u201d Reza said, according to Andersen. \u201cIf you\u2019re stopped by police, I should just wave goodbye, because there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "As of Wednesday, the State Department had advised citizens to \u201cleave Iran now\u201d and to have plans that do \u201cnot rely on U.S. government help.\u201d Other governments have also warned their citizens to leave the region as the conflict unfolds and airspace closes. The United Kingdom has advised against \"all travel to Iran.\" Similarly, Australia has said its citizens should not travel to Israel. Major U.S. carriers like Delta and American have offered rebooking options.",
      "Some Americans in Israel have also been able to leave the region after the state of Florida and a nonprofit organization arranged a flight to bring evacuees home.",
      "Andersen said his departure was possible only because of Reza, whose last name he did not share to protect his safety, and help from the State Department.",
      "\u201cI had a couple weeks there in country of really positive good experiences,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Experiencing Iran as it should be experienced.\u201d",
      "His first vlog from Iran, posted June 2, recorded him crossing into the country from Turkey. Not unlike other influencers whose content focuses on travel, Andersen also posted himself trying different local cuisines \u2014 including a fermented yogurt drink, a Persian omelet and kaleh pacheh, a stew made with goat head \u2014 and showing the hospitality of the Iranian people.",
      "\"They tried to give us for free and said we are their guests, but we had to insist,\" Andersen says in one video, which Reza explains is an example of the \"ta\u2019arof,\" a form of etiquette practiced by Iranians worldwide.",
      "As he biked around the country, he also captured the landscape and talked to viewers about the impact of sanctions, asking in one video, \"What happens when a country is cut off from the global economy for decades?\"",
      "The lighthearted, fun tone of his videos began to shift one week ago while he was in Chalus. Many of his followers began commenting, sharing concerns about his safety.",
      "\"Actually all of us are sad because this is happening,\" Reza says in one video after they heard news of the attack. \"But hope for world without war. ... Everybody needs a peaceful world.\"",
      "The two were headed toward Tehran to try to sort out a visa for Afghanistan, which was the next country on Andersen's itinerary.",
      "\"It's amazing that even after such an event, you know, an emergency, that people are so friendly,\" Andersen says after two people eating near them bring them a meal and insist they share with them.",
      "The information that was available in Iran was initially unclear, and it left Andersen with questions. Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout this week, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world.",
      "The situation soon became \u201ctoo dangerous,\" Andersen says in another video, and he and Reza decided not to go to Tehran.",
      "\u201cIt ended up being a good call, \u2019cause there was just more and more attacks as the days went by,\u201d Andersen told NBC News as he reflected on his past week.",
      "\u201cThere was lots of rumors flying around about what borders might be open,\" he added. \"Like, what, like one of the requirements once you get to the border? Like if you\u2019re able to get a visa, if you can just go through. A lifeline came through via an email from the State Department about getting into Azerbaijan.\"",
      "He ultimately was able to exit through Azerbaijan with help from Reza, who drove them to the border. He said he \"probably wouldn\u2019t be here talking\" if it weren't for Reza.",
      "\"I\u2019m out, and truly grateful for all your prayers, messages, and support,\" Andersen wrote in a recent video update. \"It\u2019s an honor to have you following this journey and caring about my wellbeing out here in the Middle East. ... And finally, to my Iranian guide Reza\u2014there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have had by my side.\"",
      "Andersen said that since he left the country, his thoughts continue to be with the people of both Iran and Israel and that he is also \u201cthinking about all the people who don\u2019t have the option to leave, like I did.\u201d",
      "U.K.-based influencers Nadia Akhtar and Irfan Aziz, who go by the handle \"fieldofvisions\" on TikTok, where they have 60,000 followers, were also in Iran when the strikes began.",
      "The couple, who were unavailable for an interview, were traveling with their young son, Zakariya. They quickly realized they were among the last to enter the country on an incoming flight and soon had a front-row seat for the attacks from their balcony.",
      "\"Iranian forces were intercepting Israeli drones right above us,\" Aziz says in a video. \"That night, we realized this wasn't normal and it's nothing like what has happened before. We needed to start thinking about an exit plan.\"",
      "The advice they got from officials was simple: \u201cGet out now.\" Like Andersen, they said they leaned on help from their guide, Ali, to help them get out.",
      "Aziz said that at 1:30 a.m. that night, they drove with Ali \"through the night despite getting zero sleep\" to get to the Turkish border.",
      "\"It was when we approached Tabriz, seven hours from Tehran, the reality of the situation kicked in,\" Aziz says in the video, adding that they saw smoke rising in different areas around them.",
      "\"Locals told us five fighter jets had bombed a cement factory at 5 in the morning. Nowhere was truly safe,\" he added.",
      "Akhtar and Aziz described their goodbyes with their guide when they finally reached Turkey\u2019s border as \u201cemotional.\u201d",
      "\"Even though we had just met, he sacrificed his own family's safety, leaving them behind in Tehran to help us,\" Aziz says in part two of his video series about the experience. \"And for this, we will forever be grateful to him. But not everyone has the privilege of leaving like we did. Millions of people just like Ali are at the receiving end of the war that has nothing to do with them.\""
