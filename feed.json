      "But the song's vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from someone who does exist: Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, a Black music artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "And he had no idea.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know about the song until people hit me up about it,\u201d said Brown, whose 2019 country rap hit \u201cThe Git Up\u201d helped usher in a new, hybrid era of country crossover. He didn't learn about the chart-topping AI track until his phone was flooded with messages from friends.",
      "\u201cMy phone just kept blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said: 'Man, somebody done typed your name in the AI and made a white version of you. They just used the Blanco, not the Brown.\u201d",
      "The moment is the latest example of how generative AI is upending the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists' voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "The credits for the grit-filled, chant-heavy track \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d list Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor as one of the song's creators, with streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify identifying him as both the songwriter and producer. In recent months, Taylor has also been credited on streaming platforms as the songwriter and producer behind Defbeatsai \u2014 one of several X-rated, AI-generated country artists that exploded across social media last year.",
      "The Defbeatsai ecosystem, however, connects back to another figure in Brown's past: Abraham Abushmais, a collaborator Brown once jokingly called \u201cAbe Einstein\u201d for his sharp studio instincts. Abushmais co-wrote a couple of songs on Brown's 2019 album \u201cHoneysuckle & Lightning Bugs\u201d and is listed as the developer of Echo, an obscure AI-powered music generator app promoted on one of Defbeats.ai's Instagram pages with a link encouraging users to \u201cmake your own hit country song.\u201d",
      "Brown said he wasn't notified about their involvement in the AI hit, and the collaborator he once mentored has since become unreachable.",
      "\u201cAbe\u2019s number changed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe used to talk. I ain\u2019t heard from him in a year or two.\u201d",
      "The AP reached out to Abushmais for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "The digital avatar fronting \u201cWalk My Walk,\" a white, AI-generated country singer built with a vocal approach modeled on Brown's sound, is where the moment shifted from eerie to uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a white AI man with a Black voice,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s singing like a Negro spiritual.\u201d",
      "For Brown, the shock quickly gave way to action. He went into the studio and recorded his cover of the song, which was released last week. He's also putting out a reworked derivative of the track on Monday with new lyrics and a new arrangement.",
      "Brown's management said his response to the song is a direct challenge to the legal, ethical and policy void surrounding AI-generated music. He wants to use his own lived experience to force the industry and lawmakers to confront who owns art and what happens when technology outpaces the rights of the human creators it imitates.",
      "\u201cIf someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\u201d he said.",
      "For musicians and educators, the success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d made one thing clear: AI-generated music has leapt from internet experiment to commercial disruptor.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a very strange and unprecedented period of both creation and industry,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of the Ohio University Music Industry Summit. \u201cAI has essentially democratized the act of music creation itself.\u201d",

      "That democratization has come with no guardrails. Major record labels sued Suno and Udio \u2014 two most popular AI song generators \u2014 accusing them of training their models on copyrighted recordings without permission.",
      "\u201cThese companies trained their platforms on a volume of recorded music without permission,\u201d Antonuccio said. \u201cIt leaves creators in this strange purgatory where they're not getting compensated.\u201d",
      "Some labels have now shifted from lawsuits to negotiation. Universal Music Group recently settled a copyright infringement lawsuits with Udio and signed a new licensing agreement with the platform. Warner Music Group followed with its own deal on Tuesday, partnering with Suno in what the companies called a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d agreement to develop licensed AI music that both compensates and protects artists.",
      "\u201cThere's no accountability mechanism at the moment,\u201d he said.",
      "The sudden success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d also raises questions about the tools enabling it. Educators say most chart-ready AI vocals today are generated through systems like Suno and Udio, which let users create full songs by prompting musical genres, vocal styles and lyrical ideas.",
      "For Brown, this situation is a legal and cultural issue.",
      "He spent years navigating country music as a Black artist who blends gospel, hip-hop, pop and twang. He's been nominated for a Grammy and embraced by the Recording Academy, but country radio hasn't given him consistent traction.",
      "Meanwhile, an AI song built on his vocal identity and paired with a white avatar went straight to No. 1, a dynamic he says reflects a familiar pattern in Nashville: innovation from Black artists being reattributed.",
      "\u201cHe created something with my tone and gave it a white face,\u201d Brown said. \u201c(Race) is an understatement in Nashville.\u201d",
      "Music educators say the issue goes beyond authorship. While AI tools can convincingly approximate sound, they aren\u2019t able to capture the source of it.",
      "\u201cThere are things a real artist conveys that the digital part never will,\u201d said Shelton \u201cShelly\u201d Berg, dean of the University of Miami's Frost School of Music and a Grammy-nominated pianist. He spoke shortly after appearing on on a Future of Music panel at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles last week. \u201cThey occupy fundamentally different spaces.\u201d",
      "Berg said AI tracks can sometimes be polished in an eerie manner, but the intangible elements of performance remain out of reach.",
      "\u201cThere's an energy between an artist and an audience that happens in real time that you can't see but you can feel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so many light years away from that happening in an AI environment.\u201d",
      "Brown insists he's not anti-AI. He's not even angry with Abushmais. He's proud that his sound inspired someone, but he understands what the moment exposes.",
      "For him, the arrival of an AI artist built on his tone only underscored something he has learned repeatedly in Nashville: talent is one thing, but how the industry assigns value is often something else.",
      "\u201cI go through this every day with real people who steal and borrow from what I do,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo I don't care if it's a robot or a human. They're not giving me credit anyway.\u201d",
      "In a fast-changing landscape, Brown said artists will have one final advantage that machines can't mimic.",
      "\u201cReal artists are always going to prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cPurpose lives where greed can't.\u201d",

      "Tollywood, the Telugu-language film industry, is rapidly gaining global attention, challenging Bollywood's dominance",
      "HYDERABAD, India -- A fast-rising parallel film industry in India is competing with Bollywood's musicals and action-packed films and has taken the world by storm: It\u2019s called Tollywood.",
      "As Mumbai is to Hindi films \u2014 or Bollywood \u2014 the southern Indian city of Hyderabad is to movies made in Telugu, one of the country\u2019s most widely spoken languages. Tollywood films like \u201cRRR\u201d and \u201cBaahubali\u201d have achieved international acclaim at the box office and on the awards stage.",
      "The Telugu-language film industry, widely known as Tollywood, is one of India\u2019s many regional movie-producing centers. But it's drawn national and global audiences with its high-adrenaline action movies, mythic storylines and grand visual style. It has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood by leaning toward star-driven spectacle and large-scale epics.",
      "Tollywood primarily operates out of Hyderabad, which is home to Ramoji Film City. The 1,666-acre (674-hectare) facility, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest film studio complex, houses massive film studio complexes, dozens of production houses, warehouses, movie sets and post-production facilities. The industry churns out around 300 films every year \u2014 fewer than Bollywood but still enough to make it one of India\u2019s largest regional industries.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s growing exposure was in large part sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, as the rapid expansion of streaming services in India allowed regional films to find wider audiences. That expansion also coincided with Bollywood\u2019s struggle to lure audiences back to theaters amid repetitive storylines and rehashes of hits from other languages.",
      "What has also worked in favor of Tollywood is that it offers a rare balance of high-octane action films and nuanced movies charged with real human drama.",
      "\u201cTelugu people have a lot of interest in movies. The Telugu audience watch and accept all kind of movies. They are cinema lovers,\u201d says filmmaker T.V. Ravi Narayan, who is working on a biopic based on an 18th-century social activist. \u201cBecause they are cinema lovers, be it \u2018Baahubali,\u2019 \u2018Pushpa\u2019 or \u2018RRR,\u2019 be it big budget or small budget, be it realistic or biopics or fantasy movies, the audiences accept it.\u201d",
      "Tollywood is known for its high-energy storytelling, big action set pieces and grand spectacle that are heavy on visual effects. It often blends family drama, action and mythology into movies, increasingly marketed as \u201cpan-India\u201d releases and dubbed in multiple regional languages.",
      "The films, like other big Indian productions, have crowd-pleasing visuals and feature viral songs and dances central to the narrative and usually presented as grand performance set pieces.",
      "Many Tollywood films are also remade in Bollywood, which has become a proven formula to expand Telugu cinema across India. Dubbing \u2014 where actors record voice-overs in Hindi or a professional voice artist replaces the track \u2014 is also a standard and tested practice that has made Tollywood more accessible.",
      "The industry does also produce smaller, low-budget films that tend to focus on stories rooted in Telugu culture. Most of them are set in rural landscapes and explore themes such as social issues, regional cultures and class inequality. Some of those films are sent straight to streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they enjoy a wide reach across India.",
      "Many Tollywood movie stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Prabhas, Ram Charan and N.T. Rama Rao Jr. command a near-godlike following, with devoted fan bases that cut across generations. Their movie releases are often tied to regional religious festivals and are preceded by carefully marketed music launch events and dance performances that are a spectacle in itself. Tens of thousands of fans attend such events, as they did recently with the first look of S.S. Rajamouli's \u201cVaranasi.\u201d",
      "The industry has also led to a massive fan club culture, predominantly centered around male film stars. Some fans are so invested in their favorite stars that they often organize charitable drives and blood donation camps in their names. It is not unusual for fans to perform acts of literal worship, washing male stars' cardboard cutouts or statues with milk \u2014 a ritual usually reserved for Hindu gods.",
      "In theaters across Hyderabad, viewers will commonly dance, whistle and throw confetti in the air during releases of films. Outside, billboards of major stars are a frequent sight in the city.",

After sweeping state elections, he became the chief minister.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s rapid commercial success and audience acceptance over the past decade has reshaped the country\u2019s entertainment landscape and pushed regional cinema further onto the world stage.",
      "Much of its recent success has been credited to filmmaker S.S. Rajamouli, who favors larger-than-life heroes and imaginative filmmaking. Rajamouli became an international name after \u201cRRR,\u201d or \u201cRise, Roar, Revolt,\u201d his 2022 three-hour epic set in British India. The sprawling anti-colonial tale became one of India\u2019s biggest hits, a global streaming phenomenon that won an Oscar for best original song. His two-part \u201cBaahubali\u201d series, released in 2015 and 2017, broke box-office records in India and a reedited version combining the two parts, \u201cBaahubali: The Epic,\u201d released in cinemas worldwide just last month.",

      "Just like Bollywood, the Telugu film industry also draws its revenue from theatrical releases, television and music rights, overseas distribution and brand partnerships. It is widely regarded as India\u2019s second-highest-grossing film industry, trailing only Bollywood.",
      "Even though the industry is largely controlled by some regionally influential film families and businessmen that have power over movie distribution and screenings, huge marketing campaigns have carried Telugu films across India and beyond.",

      "Martin Kulldorff is leaving the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to take a leadership role within the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.",
      "Dr. Kirk Milhoan, who has blamed vaccines for causing cardiovascular disease, will become the new chair. He had been appointed to the committee in September.",
      "Later this week, the committee is scheduled to discuss the pediatric vaccine schedule and hepatitis B shots given to newborns.",
      "HHS officials issued a press release praising Kulldorff and his work while leading the panel but did not answer additional questions about the changes. Kulldorff did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "The committee makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee's recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.",
      "Under Kulldorff's leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.",
      "At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called thimerosal be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",
      "In September, the group recommended new restrictions on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the unprecedented step of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations \u2014 not even for high-risk populations like seniors \u2014 instead making it a matter of personal choice.",
      "Several doctors\u2019 groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to follow guidance that was previously in place.",
      "Kulldorff's departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members.",
      "It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.",
      "Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its traditional \"evidence-to-recommendation\" framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote.",
      "In his new role, Kulldorff will become chief science officer within the HHS planning and evaluation office. Officials described the office as the department's \u201cin-house think tank.\u201d",

      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",

      "Palestinians in the West Bank are living in fear of more attacks by armed Israeli settlers",
      "TURMUS AYYA, West Bank -- The fear is palpable in this Palestinian village. It\u2019s clear in how farmers gather their harvests quickly, how they scan the valley for movement, how they dare not stray past certain roads. At any time, they say, armed Israeli settlers could descend.",
      "\u201cIn a matter of minutes, they get on their phones. They gather themselves, and they surprise you,\u201d said Yasser Alkam, a Palestinian-American lawyer and farmer from the village of Turmus Ayya. \u201cThey hide between the trees. They ambush people and beat them up severely.\u201d",
      "In recent months, Alkam says Turmus Ayya has weathered near-daily attacks by settlers, especially after they set up an outpost that the anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now says is on his village\u2019s land.",
      "Alkam says he can\u2019t reach his own fields for fear of being assaulted. In a particularly gruesome attack, he watched a settler beat a Palestinian woman unconscious with a spiky club.",
      "The fear is shared throughout the West Bank. During October's olive harvest, settlers across the territory launched an average of eight attacks daily, according to the United Nations humanitarian office, the most since it began collecting data in 2006. The attacks continued in November, with the U.N. recording at least 136 more by Nov. 24.",
      "Settlers burned cars, desecrated mosques, ransacked industrial plants and destroyed cropland. Israeli authorities have done little beyond issuing occasional condemnations of the violence.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the attackers as a minority that did not represent most settlers in the West Bank, where settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community. But their continued expansion of outposts \u2014 conducted in public with seemingly few legal repercussions \u2014 and the violence have cemented a fearful status quo for their Palestinian neighbors.",
      "While driving in fields east of Turmus Ayya on Oct. 19, Alkam saw Afaf Abu Alia, a grandmother from a nearby village, harvesting a grove of olive trees. They were loaned to her after the Israeli military bulldozed her own 500 trees this year, she said.",
      "She worked until she heard yelling in Hebrew. Settlers descended on the road nearby. Suddenly, one ran toward her with a club.",
      "\u201cThe monsters started beating me,\u201d she told The Associated Press three weeks after the attack. \u201cAfter that, my memories get all blurry.\u201d",
      "Video of the attack obtained by the AP shows a settler beating Alia with the jagged club, even after she was motionless. She was hospitalized for four days, requiring 20 stitches on her head, she said.",
      "Asked for comment on the attack, the military said its troops and police had \u201cdefused\u201d a confrontation in which Israeli civilians were torching vehicles and using violence.",
      "Police arrested a man named Ariel Dahari for beating Abu Alia. An Israeli court charged him later with terrorism.",
      "Dahari is being represented by Honenu, an organization that provides legal aid to settlers, who say the West Bank is part of the biblical Jewish homeland and often cast attacks as self-defense. According to an article about Dahari on the group's website, he has received at least 18 administrative orders since 2016 that included house arrest and confinement to his town in Israel.",
      "He told the Israeli news site Arutz Sheva in 2023 that he had been kicked out of the territory twice. It is not clear how he was able to return.",
      "Palestinians and human rights workers say Israeli soldiers and police routinely fail to prosecute attacks by violent settlers. Their sense of impunity has deepened under Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a settler, and Defense Minister Israel Katz, who in January released settlers from administrative detention, Israel\u2019s practice of detaining individuals without charge or trial.",
      "The number of investigations opened into settler violence since 2023, Ben-Gvir's first year in office, has plummeted, according to a report by Israel's Channel 12 TV that cited official police data. Police opened only 60 investigations into settler violence in 2024, compared with 150 cases in 2023 and 235 cases in 2022, the report said.",
      "About 94% of all investigation files opened by Israeli police into settler violence from 2005 to 2024 ended without an indictment, according to Israeli rights group Yesh Din. Since 2005, just 3% of those investigations led to convictions.",

      "Emek Shilo was founded this year on private Palestinian land, according to Peace Now. It was started by a well-known settler named Amishav Melet, said three Palestinians living in Turmus Ayya and Yair Dvir, the spokesperson for Israeli rights group B'tselem. On his personal X account, Melet posted videos of the outpost\u2019s construction.",
      "Villagers alleged that Melet travels the valley in an all-terrain vehicle, surveilling their activities. He\u2019s frequently armed, they said.",
      "Usually little more than a few sheds and a pen for livestock, such outposts can impose control on nearby land and water sources. They often turn into authorized settlements, spelling the end of Palestinian communities.",
      "Israeli police did not comment when asked about Melet.",
      "Abdel Nasser Awwad had to halt construction of a new family home when the outpost was established. In security camera footage he shared with AP, masked figures showed up at the construction site, smashing his truck with a club and appearing to cut piping. He said they have stoned three of his workers.",
      "When AP visited the village, groups of settlers were visible around the outpost and a settler tractor patrolled the area. Drones hummed in the air.",
      "Melet was convicted of assaulting police in 2014, according to court records. In an interview with Israel's Ynet news in 2015, Melet said he had received administrative orders barring him from the West Bank.",
      "In response to questions from the AP, Melet said he was a \u201cpeace activist.\u201d",

      "Pope Leo XIV has prayed at the site of the 2020 Beirut port explosion, urging justice for the 218 victims",
      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV prayed Tuesday at the site of a deadly 2020 Beirut port explosion that has become a symbol of dysfunction and official impunity and called for justice to prevail, as he offered words of consolation to Lebanon\u2019s people \u2014 including in the war-battered south \u2014 on the final day of his first overseas trip.",
      "Relatives of some of the 218 people killed by the blast held up photos of their loved ones as Leo arrived at the scorched site. They stood side by side as Leo prayed silently first at a monument to the dead, then greeted each one, grasping their hands.",
      "The emotional encounter took place next to the shell of the last grain silo standing at the site destroyed by the Aug. 4, 2020, blast and the piles of burned cars torched in its wake. The explosion did billions of dollars in damage as hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a port warehouse.",
      "Five years on, the families of those killed are still seeking justice. No official has been convicted in a judicial investigation that has been repeatedly obstructed, angering Lebanese for whom the blast was just the latest evidence of impunity after decades of corruption and financial crimes.",
      "\u201cThe visit clearly sends the message that the explosion was a crime,\" said Cecile Roukoz, whose brother, Joseph Roukoz, was killed and who was on hand to meet the pope. \"There should be a message, the country should end impunity and ensure justice is served.\u201d",
      "When he arrived in Lebanon on Sunday, Leo urged the country's political leaders to pursue the truth as a means of peace and reconciliation. In a homily Sunday after praying at the site, Leo referred explicitly to the blast and called for Lebanon to be a place of justice.",
      "An estimated 150,000 worshippers packed the Beirut waterfront for Leo's final Mass, which he celebrated immediately after praying at the nearby blast site.",
      "In his homily, Leo named the many problems the Lebanese people have faced, from economic crises to the blast and renewed fears of war. He said it\u2019s natural to feel \u201cparalyzed by powerlessness in the face of evil and oppressed by so many difficult situations.\u201d",
      "But he urged them not to be resigned, and to find ways to remain hopeful and grateful. He insisted, though, that justice was part of the equation.",
      "\u201cLet us cast off the armor of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cA Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognize each other as brothers and sisters.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon, stand up! Be a home of justice and fraternity! Be a prophetic sign of peace for the whole of the Levant!\u201d",
      "The American pope opened his final day in Lebanon with an emotional visit to the De La Croix hospital, which specializes in care for people with psychological problems. Awaiting him were some familiar-looking faces: young boys dressed up as Swiss Guards and cardinals, and even one dressed as the pope himself in all white.",
      "The mother superior of the congregation that runs the hospital, Mother Marie Makhlouf, was overcome as she welcomed the pope, telling him that her hospital cares for the \u201cforgotten souls, burdened by their loneliness.\u201d",
      "Leo said the facility stands as a reminder to all of humanity. \u201cWe cannot forget those who are most fragile. We cannot conceive of a society that races ahead at full speed clinging to the false myths of well-being, while at the same time ignoring so many situations of poverty and vulnerability,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor Lebanon, (the visit) means a lot,\" said pilgrim Maggie Claudine, who was waiting for Leo at the hospital. \"We hope that peace will prevail, and that is what we wish for. We want to live in comfort.\u201d",
      "Leo has sought to bring a message of peace to Lebanon as it copes with the economic crises, the aftermath of last year's devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel and the fallout from the port blast.",
      "Among those on hand to welcome Leo at the blast site was Lebanon Social Affairs Minister Haneen Sayed, whose mother was killed. Another was Mireille Khoury, whose 15-year-old son, Elias, was killed.",

      "DOUALA, Cameroon -- DOUALA, Cameroon (AP) \u2014 Cameroon's top opposition leader, Anicet Ekane, has died after weeks of detention at the age of 74, his lawyers and family said Monday, alleging that he had struggled to breathe but didn't receive proper care.",
      "Ekane was arrested in late October alongside other top figures of his African Movement for New Independence and Democracy party as protests rattled the country over allegations of fraud in presidential election. He was detained on charges of insurrection, his lawyer Emmanuel Simh told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cMr. Ekane was critically sick, he was denied appropriate treatment,\u201d Simh said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the shock and sadness. Ekane committed no crime, so we need to know why he was arrested and abandoned in the prison cell of the paramilitary gendarmerie.\u201d",
      "Ekane was among opposition figures objecting to the result of the Oct. 12 election in which Paul Biya, the world\u2019s oldest president at 92, was declared the winner of another term. Rival candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary claimed to have won and has called on Cameroonians to reject the official result.",

      "With votes from about 57% of polling places counted in Honduras, preliminary and partial results showed conservative candidates Nasry Asfura and Salvador Nasralla leading the presidential contest early Monday and the governing party trailing",
      "TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- Reyna Vega whips up simple breakfasts of eggs, fried bananas with cream and refried beans with corn tortillas at her simple two-table eatery in the center of the Honduran capital.",
      "The 52-year-old said Monday that over the past four years, prices for all of those things have risen \u2014 as have prices in most of the world \u2014 so she was eager to cast her vote in the Honduran presidential election on Sunday for a man who made her think of better times \u2014 former Tegucigalpa Mayor Nasry Asfura.",
      "Her support for the National Party\u2019s Asfura \u2014 who as mayor paved roads and improved the capital's infrastructure \u2014 was motivated in part by a burning desire to kick out the governing democratic socialist LIBRE or Liberty and Re-foundation Party.",
      "But she said friends who were vacillating between Asfura and conservative Liberal Party candidate Salvador Nasralla, the man Asfura was tied with Monday in the preliminary and partial results, were swayed in the campaign\u2019s closing days by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement of the capital\u2019s mustachioed former leader.",
      "Trump\u2019s effect and his motivation have been hotly debated in Honduras. Some say that Rixi Moncada, LIBRE\u2019s candidate, would have suffered even without Trump\u2019s attacks and warning that she would take Honduras down the same path as Venezuela. After all, Trump said the same about Nasralla, and he was only a few hundred votes behind Asfura with ballots from about 57% of polling places counted Monday.",
      "Even with partial results, there seemed to be a greater willingness to see an impact from Trump than there had been even a day before when people cast their ballots.",
      "Juan Carlos Aguilar, director of the nongovernmental organization More Just Society, said he thought Trump\u2019s intervention had drawn Asfura much closer to Nasralla than polling heading into Election Day had indicated.",
      "His comments \u201cplayed a transcendental role and made a drastic change between Salvador (Nasralla) and (Nasry) Asfura,\u201d he said.",
      "He saw the impact as being on undecided voters and those who had been thinking about \u201cloaning\u201d their votes to Nasralla, but ultimately went for Asfura instead.",
      "Fabricio Paz Mungu\u00eda, a resident of the northern industrial city of San Pedro Sula who supports Nasralla, said Monday that Trump\u2019s comments at least made some Hondurans think more about their decision.",
      "\u201cThey made a lot of people reflect on what truly would be good for the country,\u201d he said.",
      "However, it remained unclear if Asfura\u2019s early edge in the preliminary results would hold. He predictably enjoyed heavy support in the capital, whose tallies were among the first to arrive. But as the count inched along, Nasralla pulled even Monday with about 39% of the vote. The candidate who wins the most votes wins the presidency, even if the total is less than 50%.",
      "Ana Paola Hall, president of the National Electoral Council, said via the social platform X Monday afternoon, that the preliminary rapid reporting system that began providing results Sunday night had reached its conclusion with votes from 57% of polling places tallied. Asfura led Nasralla at that point by 515 votes.",
      "Hall said the count would continue, though it was not immediately clear when the advancing results would be available, because the other system\u2019s website appeared to have been taken down. She asked for continued patience as the count continued.",
      "Asfura and Nasralla filled the information void, saying their own vote tallies painted dramatically different pictures for their respective chances, while each stopped short of declaring victory.",
      "Asfura said: \u201cWe're calm, the data are going to come out.\u201d",
      "Nasralla expressed confidence that the outstanding votes in the north, where his party is stronger, would eventually overtake Asfura.",

      "The daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, resigned as a lawmaker for her father's opposition MK Party last week over the allegations. She was accused by her half-sister of duping the men into traveling to Russia under the pretense that they would receive security training that would help them secure jobs.",
      "The South African government said last month that it received distress calls from the 17 South Africans, who had been forced to fight for a Russian mercenary group in eastern Ukraine and were now trapped there. Another South African political party alleged it had information that the men's passports and clothes were burned and their cellphones were confiscated when they arrived in Russia.",

      "As part of that plea agreement, U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions in the hours and days immediately after Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
      "How did the wily drug capo who had stayed ahead of authorities for decades end up in the United States like a present tied with bow?",
      "The plea agreement did not name Zambada, but in the days after his arrest, one of his lawyers shared a letter from him that explained he had been called to a meeting with Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and there he had been abducted.",
      "Andrew Erskine, an attorney representing the U.S. government, said Monday the alleged kidnapping of an unnamed individual was part of an attempt to show cooperation with Washington, which he said did not sanction those actions. He also said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez would not receive cooperation credit because of that.",
      "The arrest of both drug traffickers by U.S. authorities angered Mexico's then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who suspected the U.S. government was behind the operation. Washington denied involvement from the outset, but experts thought it would be virtually impossible to pull off without U.S. authorities having some knowledge.",
      "Erskine described the alleged kidnapping in court, saying Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had the glass from a floor-to-ceiling window removed from a room ahead of the meeting with the unnamed person.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez allegedly had others enter through the open window, seize the individual, put a bag over his head and take him to a plane. On board, he was zip tied and given sedatives before the plane landed at a New Mexico airport near the border with Texas.",
      "Zambada in his letter said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had called him to a meeting on the outskirts of Sinaloa state\u2019s capital, Culiacan, along with some local politicians, one of whom was later found dead.",
      "He said when he arrived there were a lot of armed men in green military uniforms, who he assumed were gunmen for the \u201cChapitos,\u201d as \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons were known. Even though they ran a rival faction within the cartel, Zambada maintained communication with them and appeared to trust Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez enough to follow him into a dark room.",

      "India\u2019s telecoms ministry has ordered smartphone manufacturers to install a government-run cybersecurity app on all new devices",
      "NEW DELHI -- India\u2019s telecoms ministry has directed smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a government-run cybersecurity app on all new devices, according to a government order, raising concerns of data privacy and user consent in one of the largest handset markets in the world.",
      "The Ministry of Communications' order issued Monday asked smartphone makers to pre-install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app on all new devices within 90 days and to prevent users from deleting it. The order also requires manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update, extending the mandate beyond phones available in the market.",
      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning. It is government testing the waters,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy expert and founder of the tech site MediaNama. \u201cOnce a government app is forcibly pre-installed on our devices, what\u2019s to stop them from pushing future apps that could be used for surveillance?\u201d",
      "The \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app, which was released in January, was designed to let users block and track lost or stolen phones and to identify and shut down fraudulent mobile connections. Since its launch, it has drawn more than 5 million downloads and helped recover more than 700,000 lost devices, according to government data.",
      "Pahwa said the main concern is that the app\u2019s role could eventually expand, giving authorities greater ability to \u201caccess device status.\u201d He said the order also removes user consent as a choice.",

      "HONG KONG -- Uncomfortable questions are being raised over who is to blame for Hong Kong\u2019s deadliest blaze in decades.",
      "As the territory mourns over the high-rise apartment fire that killed at least 151 people, anger and frustration are mounting over building safety lapses, suspected construction corruption and lax government oversight.",
      "But bigger issues are at play. Some political analysts and observers say the tragedy could be the \u201ctip of an iceberg\u201d in Hong Kong, a city whose skyline is built on high-rise buildings. Suspicions of bid-rigging and use of hazardous construction materials in renovation projects across other housing estates have left many worried the disaster could be repeated.",
      "Police and the city's anti-corruption body have arrested 14 people so far in a wide-ranging probe into a multi-million dollar renovation project at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex, where the fire broke out on Wednesday. Those detained include scaffolding subcontractors, directors of a construction company and a consultancy, many of them on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence.",
      "\u201cThe question (one) should be asking, really is that, what happened at Wang Fuk Court, can it happen elsewhere?\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.",
      "Hong Kong officials initially said tests of green netting covering bamboo scaffolding at the housing complex in suburban Tai Po showed that it met fire safety codes, but highly flammable foam panels used to seal windows during the repairs, aided by strong winds, caused the blaze to spread swiftly between seven of the eight towers in the complex.",
      "But on Monday, Eric Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, said that seven of 20 additional samples collected later from the site failed to meet safety standards. Authorities said there was evidence contractors cut costs by using cheaper substandard netting along with standard materials to pad their profits, after a typhoon in July damaged some of the netting originally installed.",
      "Some fire alarms failed to sound when the fire broke out, residents and officials said.",
      "\u201cIt did open a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said John Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got all of these issues which have been swept under the table,\u201d said HKU\u2019s Burns. \u201cBecause of all that we now know -- or believe we know -- about bid-rigging, collusion, corruption, no fire alarms, government negligence, all of these things have come out.\u201d",
      "As a precaution, authorities suspended work on renovations at 28 other projects managed by the same construction company. With residents of high-rises worried, contractors were removing foam boards and netting used to cover scaffolding at other projects.",
      "The netting \u201cis not a one particular estate problem. It\u2019s a much wider general problem,\u201d said Tsang of SOAS.",
      "Government oversight also has come into question. Residents of Wang Fuk Court had been voicing safety concerns to the authorities about construction materials such as netting used in the renovations, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The Labor Department said it reviewed netting's product quality certificate and found it \u201cin line\u201d with standards. It also said it had conducted 16 inspections at the complex since last year -- most recently about a week before the fire -- and had warned contractors repeatedly they had to ensure they met fire safety requirements.",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong officials said Monday that their investigation into a deadly blaze that killed at least 151 has revealed netting that covered scaffolding used in renovations was not up to fire-safety codes, as a wave of public sympathy and support was met by government moves to stifle criticism.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s blaze, which took until Friday to fully extinguish, started on the lower-level netting around one building in the Wang Fuk Court complex. It then swept inside as the foam panels caught fire and blew out windows. Winds carried flames from building to building. Soon, seven of the eight apartment towers were ablaze.",
      "Initial tests of the netting showed it was up to code, but subsequently investigators collected 20 samples from all areas, including higher floors, and found seven failed safety standards, suggesting contractors skimped to make greater profits, said Eric Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Secretary.",
      "\u201cThey just wanted to make money at the expense of people\u2019s lives,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Chris Tang, Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security, said investigators initially hadn\u2019t been able to reach certain areas, which led to the new findings.",

      "Donations for survivors of the fire had reached 900 million Hong Kong dollars (US$115 million) as of Monday, authorities said, as a steady stream of people placed flowers, cards and other tributes at a makeshift memorial near the burned out block of buildings.",

      "Hong Kong police Disaster Victim Identification Unit staff went through five of the burned buildings but only made partial progress through the remaining two, said Tsang Shuk-yin, head of Hong Kong police\u2019s casualty enquiry unit. Teams were assessing the safety of the other buildings, including the one that caught fire first and suffered the worst damage.",
      "On Monday they recovered another eight bodies, including three firefighters found earlier but could retrieve. Dozens of people remain unaccounted for, but some are likely among the 39 bodies not yet identified, Tsang said.",
      "\u201cWe will have to wait until we get through all seven blocks before we can make a final report,\u201d she said.",
      "The donations and 300 million Hong Kong dollars ($38.5 million) in start-up capital from the government will be used to help victims rebuild their homes and provide long--term support, local officials said. The government has also given survivors cash subsidies to help with expenses, including funerals, and is working to find them housing.",
      "By Monday, 683 residents had found places in local hotels and hostels, and another 1,144 moved into transitional housing units. Two emergency shelters remained open for others, authorities said.",

      "Organizers say that interest in local, grassroots initiatives to meet community needs has been growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cTimes are tough. We take care of us.\"",
      "In early November, Kashish Ali posted those words to her Instagram story as part of a yearslong practice she's had to fundraise for food and drop it off at community fridges in Atlanta, where she's from, and now in New York, where she lives. Ali, who is 32 and a first generation Pakistani immigrant, estimated that her friends and family have trusted her with thousands of dollars over the past couple of years.",
      "For her, it's a practice of giving back and creating connection. It's also part of a growing interest in grassroots efforts to meet community needs that many call \u201c mutual aid.\u201d Often, mutual aid just comes down to neighbors helping neighbors, and as many face high prices, cuts to government programs and political uncertainty, organizers say interest has swelled. Donating effort or time to mutual aid organizing is also another way to mark GivingTuesday, which falls on Dec. 2 this year, and has become a major day to support nonprofits.",
      "Ali first noticed a fridge on the street outside of a brewery in Atlanta in 2021 and got in touch with the organizers via social media. She completed a brief volunteer orientation, joined a group text chat and then posted on her Instagram that she would buy and drop off groceries.",
      "\u201cI ended up raising $700 in like three to four hours, which was insane,\u201d she said.",
      "Now, Ali doesn't think of her grocery runs as volunteering but rather as a habit engrained in her life that directly connects to those around her. She said when she starts putting granola bars, fruit or yogurt into a fridge, people immediately come around to look, chat and grab something to eat.",
      "Afterwards, Ali posts her grocery receipts and photos of the filled fridge to her Instagram account.",
      "\u201cWhat I noticed was a lot of my friends and family and coworkers and colleagues, they all want to get involved. They want to give back,\" she said. \"But sometimes donating your cash or money to whatever organization, you don\u2019t really see what happens with it per se, especially not immediately. So this was a way to get almost instant gratification.\"",
      "One of the principles of mutual aid is that it welcomes everyone. There's no need to show an ID or prove income or residency, and most often, the organizers of these types of very local projects are all volunteers. Organizers are also often recipients, with many groups seeking to remove the distinction entirely between those who give help and those who need it.",
      "The low barriers to entry and lack of hierarchy are also part of what distinguishes this approach from the work of nonprofits, organizers said. A mantra of mutual aid is, \u201csolidarity not charity.\u201d",
      "Interest in mutual aid organizing often spikes in response to crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic and now, economic and political uncertainty under the second Trump administration.",
      "Aaron Fernando, who works as an organizer for Shareable, which publishes resources about mutual aid and cooperatives, said they saw huge interest in the Mutual Aid 101 webinars they launched earlier this year. Some 1,100 people attended the first one, up from around 70 attendees at a typical webinar.",
      "\u201cIt just is and continues to be a disempowering and scary time for a lot of populations,\u201d said Fernando, which he said encourages people to seek new options to find resources and keep their communities safe.",

      "Students applying to college know they can\u2019t \u2014 or at least shouldn\u2019t \u2014 use AI chatbots to write their essays and personal statements. So it might come as a surprise that some schools are now using artificial intelligence to read them.",
      "AI tools are now being incorporated into how student applications are screened and analyzed, admissions directors say. It can be a delicate topic, and not all colleges are eager to talk about it, but higher education is among the many industries where artificial intelligence is rapidly taking on tasks once reserved for humans.",
      "In some cases, schools are quietly slipping AI into their evaluation process, experts say. Others are touting the technology\u2019s potential to speed up their review of applications, cut processing times and even perform some tasks better than humans.",
      "\u201cHumans get tired; some days are better than others. The AI does not get tired. It doesn\u2019t get grumpy. It doesn\u2019t have a bad day. The AI is consistent,\u201d says Juan Espinoza, vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech.",
      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",
      "The university declined to comment for this article and referred to its admissions website, which it updated after the criticism. \u201cUNC uses AI programs to provide data points about students\u2019 common application essay and their school transcripts,\u201d the website says. Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

Even with 200 essay readers, the school has struggled to keep up and found itself notifying students later and later.",
      "The AI tool can scan about 250,000 essays in under an hour, compared with a human reader who averages two minutes per essay. Based on last year\u2019s application pool, \u201cWe\u2019re saving at least 8,000 hours,\u201d Espinoza said.",
      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application. But schools say AI tools can help admissions offices eliminate errors in tasks like uploading transcripts and can simplify the process for students.",
      "Georgia Tech this fall is rolling out an AI tool to review the college transcripts of transfer students, replacing the need for staff to enter each course manually into a database. It will allow the school to inform applicants more quickly how many transfer credits they'll receive, cutting down on uncertainty and wait times, said Richard Clark, the school's executive director of enrollment management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more layer of delay and stress and inevitable errors. AI is going to kill that, which I\u2019m so excited about,\u201d Clark said. The school hopes to expand the service soon to all high school transcripts. Georgia Tech also is testing out AI tools for other uses, including one that would identify low-income students who are eligible for federal Pell Grants but may not have realized it.",

      "\u201cMaybe a student was fighting a disease sophomore year. Or maybe a parent passed away, or they\u2019re taking care of siblings at home. All these things matter, and it allows the counselors to look at the transcript differently,\u201d Beatty said.",
      "Colleges are interested in AI summaries of transcripts, extracurricular activities and letters of recommendation that tell human readers the students\u2019 story in a more digestible way, said Emily Pacheco, founder of NACAC\u2019s special interest group for AI and admission.",
      "\u201cHumans and AI working together \u2014 that is the key right now. Every step along the way can be greatly improved: transcript reading, essay reviews, telling us things we might be missing about the students,\u201d said Pacheco, a former assistant director of admission at Loyola University Chicago. \u201cTen years from now, all bets are off. I\u2019m guessing AI will be admitting students.\u201d",

      "Set yourself up for success as the year winds down",
      "As 2025 winds down, here are some moves to help you finish the year strong financially. Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance and retirement planning, Christine Benz, discusses strategies.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Q: What are the benefits of portfolio rebalancing, and who most needs to do it?",
      "A: The main benefit of rebalancing is risk reduction. You trim securities that have performed really well, presumably ones with higher valuations today. And you redirect the money into securities where returns have lagged, but valuations might be more attractive. It\u2019s also important to rebalance on an ongoing basis as you get closer to your spending target.",
      "As retirement approaches, we need to spend that money, so you want to de-risk your portfolio and build safer asset reserves. Investors age 50 and above really need to take notice of rebalancing. It\u2019s time to take some winnings and build safer assets that you could access if you needed to spend from your portfolio. Moving money into high-quality bonds removes risk and takes advantage of current attractive yields.",
      "Q: What do you recommend for people who are still working and saving for retirement?",
      "A: They should rebalance as well, but their main consideration should be their U.S. versus non-U.S. exposure. Most investors are underallocated in international stocks. Consider your style diversification as well, paying attention to underperforming areas.",
      "Review your retirement contributions, to see if you can boost or even max out your company retirement plan for the year. People over 50 can make catch-up contributions, and there are special catch-up contributions this year for people between 60 and 63. You can contribute to IRAs and HSAs until the tax filing deadline.",
      "Q: How can people over 73 connect their RMDs with portfolio rebalancing?",
      "A: Required minimum distributions must be taken on time, but they can also help meet your rebalancing. By using appreciated securities to meet your RMD, you de-risk your portfolio, satisfy the IRS\u2019 obligations, and may free up assets to supply your cash flow needs for next year.",
      "Q: Is it also a good time to look at your insurance coverage?",
      "A: Whether you are doing open enrollment for employer-provided health care or for Medicare, it\u2019s important to shop around. Take stock of what has changed in your situation, and in the plans on offer. This is particularly important for employer-provided plans, which change frequently. Married couples often select whichever spouse\u2019s plan looks better and most affordable, but sometimes it\u2019s more cost-effective for each partner to be covered by their own company\u2019s plan.",
      "Q: How can charitable donations connect with RMDs and lessen your portfolio risk?",
      "A: Investors with highly appreciated holdings in taxable accounts should consider giving appreciated assets directly to charity or sending them to a donor-advised fund. You can disburse from the donor-advised fund to charities over multiple years. Donating removes a highly appreciated asset from your portfolio, which can lessen risk, and removes the tax liability associated with that holding. You won\u2019t owe taxes on donated funds, and you could get a tax deduction.",

      "Missouri has become the latest state to launch sports betting",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- As Missouri launches sports betting Monday, people will be able to wager on how many points a particular athlete will score in a game \u2014 so long as it doesn't involve a Missouri college or university.",
      "The restriction on \" proposition bets,\" though less sweeping than in some states, highlights an area of rising concern as legal sports betting spreads to its 39th state in a steady expansion since the Supreme Court cleared the way for it in 2018.",
      "In the weeks leading up to Missouri's betting debut, one scandal after another has rocked the sports world. Two Cleveland Guardians pitchers were charged with taking bribes to throw certain pitches. An NBA player was arrested over an alleged scheme to provide inside information to gamblers. And the NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men\u2019s college basketball players accused of manipulating their performance in games.",
      "All centered around the outcome of prop bets, a popular type of wager often focused on what individual players will do in a game \u2014 like achieving a certain number of strikeouts in baseball, racking up a certain amount of points and rebounds in basketball, or surpassing a particular passing yardage in football.",
      "For bettors, a lot can ride on one player, putting those athletes at risk of threats or enticements to rig their performance.",
      "Sports betting operators took in over $11 billion through the first three-quarters of this year, up more than 13% from the same span last year, according to the American Gaming Association, which represents the industry.",
      "Though national data is lacking about the prevalence of prop bets, they are \u201can increasingly popular way in which to provide for engagement for any type of fan,\u201d said Joe Maloney, the association's senior vice president of strategic communications.",
      "West Virginia, which was among the first to allow sports betting after the court ruling, now is collecting a trove of data from the industry. During a roughly one-month period this summer, prop bets comprised more than half of all wagers made through one of the largest sports betting platforms, said Brad Humphreys, an economics professor and director of the Center for Gaming Research and Development at West Virginia University.",
      "Additionally, he said, almost all bets involved parlays, where two or more wagers are grouped together under the umbrella of a larger bet. To win, a person must be right on each prong in the bet, making the odds of success longer and the potential payout larger.",
      "Because prop bets \u201cspeed up the ability to make multiple bets,\u201d they carry a higher risk of developing addictive behavior for some bettors, said Rachel Volberg, a research professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has spent decades studying gambling.",
      "Most states provide some money for problem gambling services. Missouri's new sports betting program allots at least $5 million annually for that purpose.",
      "Prop bets on professional athletes are currently allowed in every state that has legalized sports betting, though legislation proposed in New Jersey would ban them. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has urged state regulators to end player-specific micro betting and told The Associated Press recently he regrets signing the law that legalized sports gambling in his state.",
      "States have widely differing rules for bets on college athletes. More than a dozen states place no limits on collegiate prop bets while an equal number prohibit all such bets. Other states fall somewhere in between. Missouri is one of over a half-dozen states with a prop bet prohibition pertaining only to games involving college teams from their states.",

      "Missouri's restriction was included in a constitutional amendment authorizing sports betting that won narrow voter approval last year after a state-record $43 million campaign funded almost entirely by DraftKings and FanDuel, the two predominant sports betting sites.",
      "\u201cWe thought this was a good middle ground that had worked in other states and that would uphold the integrity of the games here,\u201d said Jack Cardetti, a spokesperson for the Sports Betting Alliance, an industry group that supported Missouri\u2019s amendment.",
      "A blanket ban on prop bets likely would drive people to illegal and unregulated sportsbooks, placing bettors at greater risk and making it harder to flag problems, the Sports Betting Alliance said.",
      "Others doubt that Missouri's narrowly tailored prop bet restrictions will have much impact in an Internet-connected society where people can easily bet on athletes playing anywhere in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a Band-Aid on a dam that\u2019s breaking here,\u201d said Nathan Novemsky, a professor of marketing and psychology at Yale University, \"because folks will just make those bets on other teams.\u201d",
      "The Missouri Gaming Commission has three employees focused on regulating sports betting and is looking to hire a fourth, said commission chair Jan Zimmerman.",
      "But the job of detecting fraudulent bets falls largely to sports betting operators working with sports leagues and law enforcement agencies. After the recent indictment of two Guardians pitchers, Major League Baseball announced an agreement with leading sportsbooks to cap bets on individual pitches at $200 and exclude them from parlays.",
      "The criminal charges, player penalties and policy changes involving prop bets are \"a demonstration that the market is really working as intended,\u201d Maloney said.",
      "The scandals aren't deterring some Missouri residents who have been eagerly waiting for sports wagering.",
      "Brett Koenig, who lives in suburban St. Louis, has occasionally crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois to legally bet on sports. Others who live in the Kansas City area have driven across the border into Kansas, pulling over at the first exit to place bets from smartphones. The drive allows bettors to get around geolocation technology that blocks bets from people in states where it's not legal.",
      "Koenig said he plans to bet on Monday night\u2019s NFL game without leaving his home. He might place some type of prop bet, if he likes the odds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a long time,\u201d said Koenig, who used social media to push for legalized sports betting. \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic to have the opportunity to do it, and to not have to drive 45 minutes across the river.\"",

      "A new type of lens approved by the FDA promises to slow nearsightedness in children",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",
      "But Gupta says many parents and physicians are likely to prefer the glasses.",
      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",

      "Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, GivingTuesday, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S. This year, nonprofits face uncertainty about how donors may respond to a range of changing factors.",
      "High prices may affect how much small dollar donors give this year or how many charities they will support. But President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending legislation, which passed in July, also included a new charitable deduction of up to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for married couples for the majority of tax filers. That could incentivize more households to give.",
      "For larger donors, a strong stock market usually indicates they will give generously. These major donors also make up an increasingly important share of overall charitable donations and are more likely to give than less economically well off households, according to a study from the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy in partnership with Bank of America.",
      "Nonprofits are also letting potential supporters know about a range of new challenges this year, with many human service organizations seeing higher demand while facing cuts to government grants, especially last month's freeze of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. And many charities are highlighting programs that will match or multiply donations \u2014 even up to a factor of five at some nonprofits \u2014 to showcase increased impact.",
      "Altogether, that sets up GivingTuesday, which falls on Dec. 2 to be a high stakes fundraising day for U.S. nonprofits.",
      "The #GivingTuesday hashtag started as a project of the 92nd Street Y in New York in 2012 and became an independent organization in 2020. It\u2019s grown into a worldwide network of local organizations that promote giving in their communities, often on different dates that have local relevance, like holidays.",
      "Now, GivingTuesday, the nonprofit, also convenes researchers working on topics about everyday giving. It also collects data from a wide range of sources like payment processors, crowdfunding sites, employee giving software and institutions that offer donor-advised funds, a kind of charitable giving account.",
      "The hashtag was started to promote generosity and the nonprofit continues to promote giving in the broadest sense.",
      "For nonprofits, the point of GivingTuesday is to raise money and engage their supporters. Many will be familiar with the barrage of email and mail appeals that coincide on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. Essentially all major American nonprofits will organize fundraising campaigns and many smaller, local groups also participate.",
      "Nonprofits don\u2019t have to be affiliated in any way with GivingTuesday, the organization, to run a fundraising campaign. They can just do it, though GivingTuesday does provide graphics and advice. In that way, it remains a grassroots effort with groups and donors participating however they like.",

The day has become an enduring and well-known event that seeks to center charitable giving, volunteering and civic participation in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "For years, GivingTuesday has been a major focus of fundraising for nonprofits, with many seeking to organize matching donations from major donors and to leverage their networks of supporters to contribute.

      "India\u2019s telecoms ministry has ordered smartphone manufacturers to install a government-run cybersecurity app on all new devices",
      "NEW DELHI -- India\u2019s telecoms ministry has directed smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a government-run cybersecurity app on all new devices, according to a government order, raising concerns of data privacy and user consent in one of the largest handset markets in the world.",
      "The Ministry of Communications' order issued Monday asked smartphone makers to pre-install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app on all new devices within 90 days and to prevent users from deleting it. The order also requires manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update, extending the mandate beyond phones available in the market.",
      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning. It is government testing the waters,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy expert and founder of the tech site MediaNama. \u201cOnce a government app is forcibly pre-installed on our devices, what\u2019s to stop them from pushing future apps that could be used for surveillance?\u201d",
      "The \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app, which was released in January, was designed to let users block and track lost or stolen phones and to identify and shut down fraudulent mobile connections. Since its launch, it has drawn more than 5 million downloads and helped recover more than 700,000 lost devices, according to government data.",
      "Pahwa said the main concern is that the app\u2019s role could eventually expand, giving authorities greater ability to \u201caccess device status.\u201d He said the order also removes user consent as a choice.",

      "In Russia, authorities have recently promoted the MAX messaging service, which must be pre-installed on all smartphones. Critics say the platform functions as a surveillance tool, noting that MAX openly states it will provide user data to officials upon request.",

      "However, it remained unclear if Asfura\u2019s early edge in the preliminary results would hold. He predictably enjoyed heavy support in the capital, whose tallies were among the first to arrive. But as the count inched along, Nasralla pulled even Monday with about 39% of the vote. The candidate who wins the most votes wins the presidency, even if the total is less than 50%.",
      "Ana Paola Hall, president of the National Electoral Council, said via the social platform X Monday afternoon, that the preliminary rapid reporting system that began providing results Sunday night had reached its conclusion with votes from 57% of polling places tallied.

      "Asfura said: \u201cWe're calm, the data are going to come out.\u201d",

      "The Transportation Department said Monday that it plans to revoke the certification of nearly 3,000 schools unless they can comply with training requirements in the next 30 days. The targeted schools must notify students that their certification is in jeopardy. Another 4,500 schools are being warned they may face similar action.",
      "Schools that lose certification will no longer be able to issue the certificates showing a driver completed training that's required to get a license, so students are likely to abandon those schools. It\u2019s not clear how many of those schools have been actively teaching students.",
      "Separately, the Department of Homeland Security is auditing trucking firms in California owned by immigrants to verify the status of their drivers and whether they are qualified to hold a commercial driver\u2019s license.",
      "This crackdown on trucking schools and companies is the latest step in the government's effort to ensure that truck drivers are qualified and eligible to hold a commercial license. This began after a truck driver that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.",
      "The action reins in \"illegal and reckless practices that let poorly trained drivers get behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "Duffy has threatened to pull federal funding from California and Pennsylvania over the issue, and he proposed significant new restrictions on which immigrants can get a commercial driver's license but a court put those new rules on hold. On Monday, he threatened to withhold $30.4 million from Minnesota if that state doesn't address shortcomings in its commercial driver's license program and revoke any licenses that never should have been issued either because they were valid beyond a driver's work permit or because the state never verified a driver's immigration status.",
      "So far, every state Duffy has threatened has been a Democratic state, but he has said the department is auditing a number of other states, including Texas and South Dakota.",
      "Claire Lancaster, a spokesperson for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, said: \u201cWe take safety on our roads seriously and the Minnesota Department of Public Safety has already worked to ensure we are in compliance with federal law.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how action against these trucking schools could affect the existing shortage of drivers, but the executive director of the largest association of trucking schools, Andrew Poliakoff, said many of the schools being decertified were questionable \u201cCDL mills\u201d that would advertise being able to train drivers in just a few days.",
      "In established training schools, students normally spend at least a month and get lessons both behind the wheel and in the classroom.",
      "He said those questionable schools were really just \u201cfleecing people out of money\u201d without teaching them the skills they need to get hired or pass the test.",
      "\u201cTrucking is an outstanding career. And the people who are not familiar with the industry might see someone charging $1,000 in $2,000 for a long weekend or quick training.

      "When major disruptions happen in communities, often the first people to respond are the residents themselves and their neighbors. When the pandemic shut down daily life or after a disaster like a hurricane or wildfire, people get together to take care of each other.",
      "Even outside of a crisis, some who struggle to meet their needs may turn to mutual aid, the practice of finding resources from within a community and exchanging them for free.",
      "Now, in response to government funding cuts, high prices and political uncertainty, especially targeting immigrants, interest in mutual aid projects has picked up, organizers and participants say.",
      "\u201cThe exciting part about mutual aid is that you can really get together and help people in a really meaningful way just by pooling resources and being willing to reach out,\u201d said Mary Zerkel, who lives in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago.",
      "Mutual aid practices have a long history, especially among immigrant and Black communities in the U.S., like the Black Panther\u2019s Survival Programs or informal pooled savings circles.",
      "Examples include sharing food, exchanging household goods and clothes or organizing shared items like tools. In recent years, groups have helped people access reproductive healthcare, including abortions, and coordinated collective responses to immigration arrests under the umbrella of providing mutual aid.",
      "In 2019, Zerkel helped start a shared artist and community space in her neighborhood along with a local chapter of Food Not Bombs, a longstanding mutual aid group that distributes food. When the pandemic hit, they cleared out the art supplies.",
      "\"All of a sudden, we had six fridges in there and we were feeding and delivering meals to 400 families,\u201d Zerkel said.",
      "Over time, the organizers adapted to changing needs. When they realized people needed items beyond food, they started a \"free store,\" where people can donate things they don't need. They trained volunteers in de-escalation techniques to diminish the possibility of ever calling the police. Later, they sourced naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses, and held trainings on how to use it.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is that you\u2019re not trying to be an institution,\" Zerkel said. \"You\u2019re trying to be a neighbor helping a neighbor, so you can do the best that you can and try to be responsible and loving to your neighbors and build something slowly.\u201d",
      "Many mutual aid networks are not incorporated as formal organizations or nonprofits. Giving to them won't offer a tax deduction, but organizers say that because they are all volunteers, any donations they receive go directly to meeting real community needs.",
      "\u201cPeople are less suspicious of our intention. We are getting food and giving it out. We don\u2019t have any salaried employees,\u201d said Nicholas Grosso, who has organized with Sunnyside and Woodside Mutual Aid in Queens, New York.",

      "Mutual aid projects often specifically try to avoid hierarchies and make decisions collectively. Taylor Dudley, director of coalition building at the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of community accountability to mutual aid. Often times in nonprofits, rather than having the community accountability at the center, there\u2019s accountability to donors,\u201d or to administrative or legal considerations.",
      "Mutual aid efforts are built on trust and the relationships between organizers and their communities.",
      "Aaron Fernando, who works for Shareable, which publishes resources about mutual aid and cooperatives, said the small scale of many groups helps to hold people accountable. Over time, organizers know who is reliable and who has integrity. But there is a risk that opportunists take advantage of what is being offered.",
      "Often, mutual aid groups collect money and distribute it to people who need it or use it to buy things. Groups should consider how to handle those funds as sometimes they can be flagged as income by a payment processor. The Sustainable Economies Law Center has a guide that lays out multiple scenarios that mutual aid groups might encounter. Mohini Mookim, an attorney with the center, said rules around giving money with no strings attached are generally promising for mutual aid groups.",
      "\u201cWhen people are acting motivated by love, the tax code calls it generosity or feelings of generosity, then oftentimes, there are less legal, especially tax law, implications of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d they said.",
      "Another potential risk has to do with privacy or surveillance. For example, if a group is dropping food of at someone's home, they should think carefully about who has access to those addresses.",
      "There are also examples of mutual aid groups facing charges or being asked to stop handing out food by police. Fernando, of Shareable, said that often has less to do with concerns about people getting sick from the food and more about businesses or residents nearby not wanting the food distribution to happen there.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his Treasury chief Rachel Reeves against claims she misled the public about government finances before last week's tax-hiking budget",
      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday defended his Treasury chief against opposition claims that she misled the public and the markets about the state of the public finances before last week\u2019s budget.",
      "Starmer said \u201cthere was no misleading\u201d in the run-up to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves' tax-hiking budget, which the government hopes will raise money to reduce government borrowing, invest in infrastructure and public services, ease the cost of living and spur elusive economic growth.",
      "Three weeks before the budget, Reeves made a speech to prepare the public and markets for a rise in income tax rates, which would have broken a key election promise. After an outcry among governing Labour Party lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on the public finances, she reversed course, opting for smaller revenue-raising measures.",
      "Opposition politicians allege that Reeves knew when she made the speech that the forecast from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility was better than expected.",
      "The Conservatives and the Scottish National Party have asked the Financial Conduct Authority to investigate Reeves\u2019 comments and leaks to the media before the budget, and Reform U.K. leader Nigel Farage has urged the government\u2019s standards adviser to probe Reeves\u2019 comments.",
      "Reeves denies misleading the public or markets. She said Sunday that the OBR assessed before the budget that tax revenue would be 16 billion pounds ($21 billion) less than expected because of a downgraded productivity forecast. That is a smaller budget hole than had previously been reported, leading government critics to imply there was skullduggery by the government.",
      "Reeves said that in her speech she said, correctly, that \u201cthe OBR downgrade has had a big impact on the public finances. And that was why I would need to ask people to contribute more.\u201d",

Some of the budget\u2019s 26 billion pounds ($34 billion) in tax hikes, largely to increase the buffer available to the government for any future shocks, broke the spirit if not the letter of that promise.",
      "Starmer hit back in a speech Monday at a community center in London, saying his government had inherited \u201cpublic finances and public services in total crisis\u201d after 14 years of Conservative government. He defended the decision to raise taxes, raise the minimum wage and fund public services that will help lift children out of poverty.",
      "\u201cWe confronted reality, we took control of our future and Britain is now back on track,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cBit by bit, you will see a country that no longer feels the burden of decline.\u201d",
      "He said the government would push forward with two potentially risky tasks: cutting Britain\u2019s ballooning welfare bill and moving closer to the European Union. The first of those risks angering Labour members, while the second will rile pro-Brexit Conservative and Reform politicians.",
      "Starmer said the exit deal negotiated before Britain left the EU in 2020 had \"significantly hurt our economy.",
      "\u201cWe have to keep moving toward a closer relationship with the EU,\u201d he said.",

      "Poll workers have begun tallying Hondurans\u2019 votes as the country moves to elect a new president only days after U.S. President Donald Trump intervened in a close race with an endorsement of one candidate and announced he would pardon a former president",
      "TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- Poll workers began tallying Hondurans' votes Sunday evening as the country moved to elect a new president only days after U.S. President Donald Trump intervened in a close race by endorsing a candidate and announcing that he would pardon a former president.",
      "Voting was extended an hour beyond the original closing time in many locations to accommodate remaining voters. No major voting problems were initially reported by electoral authorities.",
      "In addition to a new president, voters were casting ballots for a new Congress, as well as hundreds of local positions.",
      "Among the five presidential candidates on the ballot, polls indicated three had a chance to win and were finishing in close competition. They are:",
      "1. Rixi Moncada, who served as finance and later as defense secretary in the current administration of President Xiomara Castro and is running for the social democrat LIBRE or Liberty and Re-foundation party. Moncada is promising to \u201cdemocratize\u201d an economy still defined by extreme wealth and poverty.",
      "2. Salvador Nasralla, who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the conservative Liberal Party. He casts himself as an outsider who can clean up the country\u2019s endemic corruption.",
      "3. Former Tegucigalpa Mayor Nasry \u201cTito\u201d Asfura, who is trying to restore the conservative National Party as a pro-business force after former presidents from the party were embroiled in corruption scandals, with one sent to prison in the U.S.",
      "Hondurans say security and jobs remain their top priorities, despite an economy that has strengthened during Castro\u2019s administration. Honduras\u2019 security situation has improved in recent years as homicides across the region continue to fall, but it still has Central America\u2019s highest homicide rate.",
      "The presidential contest mostly focused on candidates trading accusations of plans to manipulate the vote until this past week, when Trump endorsed Asfura while attacking his opponents, the latest signal of the United States\u2019 renewed interest in Latin America.",
      "Trump shocked Hondurans Friday by announcing that he would pardon ex-President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who was serving a 45-year sentence in a U.S. prison for helping drug traffickers move cocaine to the United States.",
      "It was unclear what impact Trump would have on the election, but it was the latest show of the U.S. government\u2019s willingness to directly involve itself in the region and came at a time of already heightened tensions because of the U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and Trump\u2019s threats against Venezuela President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "When asked why he pardoned Hern\u00e1ndez, Trump argued that he was answering the calls of Hondurans who believed the case was politically motivated.",
      "\u201cThe people of Honduras really thought he was set up, and it was a terrible thing,\u201d Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One later Sunday.",
      "\u201cThey basically said (Hern\u00e1ndez) was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration set-up. And I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",

      "The Buffalo Bills have bounced back from a loss at Houston by pushing around the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 26-7 win",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills came to Pittsburgh looking for something \u2014 anything, really \u2014 to snap themselves out of a midseason lull that had robbed them of their swagger, not to mention their usual grip on first place in the AFC East.",
      "The Bills found it during three hours of remarkably simple and remarkably effective football in a 26-7 victory on Sunday that made up for in sheer force what it lacked in style.",
      "Allen threw for a touchdown and ran for another, Joey Bosa sacked Aaron Rodgers to spring Christian Benford for a game-tilting, 17-yard scoop-and-score, and the Bills (8-4) set an Acrisure Stadium record by piling up 249 yards rushing while whipping the reeling Steelers.",
      "\u201cFound a way to win, that's all that matters,\u201d said Allen, last season's MVP.",
      "Maybe, but the Bills may also have found something that could be effective down the stretch.",
      "Playing without their starting offensive tackles and coming off a loss at Houston in which Allen was sacked eight times, Buffalo responded by opting to gash the Steelers. James Cook ran for 144 yards, Ray Davis added 62 and Allen chipped in 38, including the 76th rushing touchdown of his career, the most by a quarterback.",
      "Allen demurred when asked about breaking the mark of 75 previously held by Cam Newton, saying that's not why he plays. Still, his bulldozing 8-yard score early in the fourth quarter that put the game out of reach was symbolic of a day when Buffalo absorbed a couple of blows from the Steelers and kept on chugging.",
      "Allen juked past one defender, then fought off three more while his teammates dragged him across the goal line.",
      "\u201cThe line coming to throw me in there was pretty cool,\u201d Allen said.",
      "And pretty alarming for Pittsburgh (6-6). On a blustery day that made passing treacherous, the Steelers knew they were going to be tested by one of the NFL's best rushing teams. They failed repeatedly. Buffalo held the ball for nearly 42 minutes and probably could have taken control earlier if not for a pair of first-half turnovers.",
      "\u201cThat's an awful performance by us,\" Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said.",
      "The Steelers have dropped five of seven since a 4-1 start. While they remain tied with Baltimore atop the AFC North, they have not looked competitive at times against quality opponents during a funk that shows little sign of abating.",
      "Rodgers, playing with a brace protecting his broken left wrist, was largely ineffective and missed the chunk of one drive early in the second half after getting drilled by Bosa on the first play of the third quarter.",
      "The four-time MVP fumbled on the play, and Benford picked up the loose ball and sprinted to the end zone to turn a 7-3 halftime deficit into a 10-7 lead. The 41-year-old quarterback left the field with a bloody nose.",
      "Mason Rudolph filled in for Rodgers for a series and threw an interception that ended up in Benford\u2019s hands. Buffalo marched 56 yards in eight plays, and Allen\u2019s fourth-down flip to Coleman gave the Bills firm control.",
      "Rodgers returned but finished 10 of 21 for 117 yards as the Steelers lost for the fifth time in seven games while being booed frequently.",

      "Crosby is seven shy of Lemieux for the most regular-season points with the Penguins. He already holds the team record for regular and postseason points combined.",
      "Heck, play Philadelphia a few more times each season, and Crosby could have shattered the record years ago.",
      "Crosby scored his 58th and 59th career goals against the Flyers on Monday night. His continued excellence in the cross-state rivalry helped lead the Penguins to a 5-1 win.",
      "Crosby, who has 18 goals this season, has dominated the Flyers like no other visiting player has done in Philadelphia\u2019s franchise history. Crosby has 59 goals and 137 points in 92 games against Philadelphia, the most in both categories any opponent has ever put up on the Flyers.",
      "The 38-year-old Crosby has 1,716 career points, close to eclipsing Lemieux\u2019s 1,723 for most in franchise history. Lemieux owned the team when Crosby captained the Penguins to championships in 2009, 2016 and 2017.",
      "Lemieux seems to be saving his well-wishes for when the record ultimately falls.",
      "\u201cI'm sure he knows me well enough to know that's not something I really want to talk about it,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cJust go out there and play. If it happens, it happens.\u201d",
      "It will happen. Soon.",
      "Crosby is in the thick of the hunt for the NHL goals lead. Colorado's Nathan McKinnon and Boston's Morgan Geekie each have 20.",
      "The Flyers promoted the game all night as a Keystone Rivalry game but the series \u2014 even as fans voraciously booed Crosby with each touch \u2014 has never been much of a rivalry. Crosby has won three Stanley Cup titles while the Flyers have won only two in franchise history, in 1974 and 1975. Crosby wasn\u2019t even born until 1987.",

      "Crosby has never played like everyone else. He did enough damage to snap the Flyers\u2019 modest three-game winning streak \u2014 and help Pittsburgh rebound after a 7-2 loss to Toronto.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a game like that, you just want to respond, regardless of who you're playing,\u201d Crosby said.",
      "Crosby scored to give the Penguins a 1-0 lead \u2014 his 60th career road game-opening goal \u2014 and added a wrist shot through traffic on the power play for a 2-1 lead in the second period.",
      "The Penguins were one of the early surprises of the NHL season until a stretch of seven losses in nine games in November. The team considered a long shot to reach the playoffs when the season began \u2014 only Chicago and San Jose faced slimmer odds of hoisting the Stanley Cup than Pittsburgh \u2014 has since tumbled from the top spot in the Metropolitan Division it held a month into the season.",
      "The perpetually rebuilding Flyers and Penguins are tied with 31 points apiece.",
      "Crosby at least gives Penguins and NHL fans a reason to watch \u2014 his No. 87 jersey was spotted around the concourse more than any Flyer \u2014 and chasing Lemieux can spice up an otherwise dead zone in the schedule. Even his teammates, who watch him practice and play on the daily, remain in awe of Crosby.",
      "\u201cIt shows you what kind of exceptional player and person that he is, to never be satisfied with anything,\u201d said Bryan Rust, who had a goal and two assists in the victory over the Flyers. \u201cEverything he\u2019s done at a team level, at an individual level, on and off the ice. It\u2019d be easy to kind of start to pull back the reins a little bit, but I think it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s almost fueling him a little bit more to get more and more.\u201d",

      "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Kentucky fired the Southeastern Conference's longest-tenured coach, ending Mark Stoops' tenure in his 13th season with the Wildcats after back-to-back losing records Monday morning.",
      "By Monday night, athletic director Mitch Barnhart announced the hiring of Stoops' replacement in Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein, 36, coming home to Kentucky where his father once played. This will be Stein's first head coaching job.",
      "\u201cWill Stein brings an outstanding track record of developing elite quarterbacks and leading some of the most dynamic and successful offenses in college football,\u201d Barnhart said.",
      "Kentucky became the sixth SEC program to change coaches this season, joining Auburn, Arkansas, Florida, LSU and Mississippi.",
      "Stoops had been tied with N.C. State coach Dave Doeren for the fifth longest-tenured coach at a Bowl Subdivision program. He trailed only Kirk Ferentz with 27 seasons at Iowa, Kyle Whittingham with 21 at Utah, Troy Calhoun with 19 at Air Force and Dabo Swinney with 18 at Clemson.",
      "Stoops signed an extension in November 2022 taking him through June 2031 and paying him $9 million for the 2025 season. That made him the fifth-highest paid coach in the SEC.",

      "Kentucky had faced paying Stoops a $37.6 million buyout within 60 days of his firing, though reportedly Stoops has agreed to a change in the payment schedule. Stoops made clear he wouldn\u2019t leave on his own after the loss to Louisville.",
      "\u201cZero percent chance I walk away,\u201d Stoops said Saturday, adding the decision was not his to make. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d",
      "He was one of only 17 head coaches who coached at least 13 seasons at an SEC school since the league debuted in 1933. He was Kentucky\u2019s all-time winningest coach with a record of 82-80, though 10 wins were vacated by the NCAA.",
      "Stoops coached Kentucky to seven bowl games, a Top 10 ranking in The Associated Press Top 25 and a school-record 16-game winning streak against nonconference competition. He led the Wildcats to their first home win over Florida since 1986.",

      "Barnhart made clear Monday morning that money will be invested.",

    "story": [
      "Conservationists are hoping to strengthen regulations at a wildlife trade conference on birds, reptiles and other animals that are seeing their numbers decline due to the exotic pet trade",
      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "A species can be banned for trade in its home range but sold online by traders who abuse the CITES permitting process and captive breeding rules and then take advantage of importing countries that don't bother to check if the animals come from the wild, Collis said.",
      "\u201cIn theory, under CITES rules, the countries issuing those export permits should be checking that these animals, and crucially their parentage all the way back to the founder stock, were legally acquired in order for an export permit to be granted,\u201d Collis said. \u201cBut that is not happening.\"",
      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",
      "The CITES proposals draw attention to a long-running problem with captive breeding of exotic species, according to Lieberman of the Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",
      "A proposal has also been submitted at the convention to regulate the trade in more than a dozen species of tarantulas. Bolivia, Argentina and Panama note they are \u201camong the most heavily traded groups of invertebrates\u201d with more than half all species available online. The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",
      "The United States Association of Reptile Keepers opposes the tarantula listing, which it called \u201cincongruous\u201d for rolling many species into a single proposal.",
      "The association, which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians, suggested other reptile proposals reflect government overreach, noting the proffered changes to iguana sales are unnecessary since current regulations \u201cprovide adequate protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost species have limited trade in captive bred specimens which is not a threat to wild populations,\u201d David Garcia, the organization's legal counsel and its delegate at the CITES conference, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, many countries, groups, and individuals take the nonsensical position that the way to limit threats to wild populations is to make the captive reproduction of those species more difficult.",
      "But a report from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, shared with The Associated Press and due to be released Dec. 8, found that the United States was among the biggest markets for the pet trade, importing on average 90 million live amphibians, arachnids, birds, aquarium fish, mammals and reptiles each year.",
      "\u201cWildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne million species are on track to face extinction in coming decades unless action is taken to address species loss. Addressing the United States\u2019 role in the exotic pet trade must be a top priority to stem this crisis and protect biodiversity for future generations.\u201d",

      "NEW DELHI -- India\u2019s telecoms ministry has directed smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a government-run cybersecurity app on all new devices, according to a government order, raising concerns of data privacy and user consent in one of the largest handset markets in the world.",
      "The Ministry of Communications' order issued Monday asked smartphone makers to pre-install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app on all new devices within 90 days and to prevent users from deleting it. The order also requires manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update, extending the mandate beyond phones available in the market.",
      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning. It is government testing the waters,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy expert and founder of the tech site MediaNama. \u201cOnce a government app is forcibly pre-installed on our devices, what\u2019s to stop them from pushing future apps that could be used for surveillance?\u201d",
      "Amid growing criticism, India\u2019s telecom minister, Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, on Tuesday called the app a \u201cvoluntary and democratic system\" and said users can choose to activate it and \u201ceasily delete it from their phone at any time.\u201d",
      "Scindia did not clarify Monday\u2019s directive instructing smartphone manufacturers to ensure the app\u2019s \u201cfunctionalities are not disabled or restricted.\u201d",
      "The \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app, which was released in January, was designed to let users block and track lost or stolen phones and to identify and shut down fraudulent mobile connections. Since its launch, it has drawn more than 5 million downloads and helped recover more than 700,000 lost devices, according to government data.",

      "Students applying to college know they're not supposed to use AI chatbots to write their essays",
      "Students applying to college know they can\u2019t \u2014 or at least shouldn\u2019t \u2014 use AI chatbots to write their essays and personal statements. So it might come as a surprise that some schools are now using artificial intelligence to read them.",
      "AI tools are now being incorporated into how student applications are screened and analyzed, admissions directors say. It can be a delicate topic, and not all colleges are eager to talk about it, but higher education is among the many industries where artificial intelligence is rapidly taking on tasks once reserved for humans.",
      "In some cases, schools are quietly slipping AI into their evaluation process, experts say. Others are touting the technology\u2019s potential to speed up their review of applications, cut processing times and even perform some tasks better than humans.",
      "\u201cHumans get tired; some days are better than others. The AI does not get tired. It doesn\u2019t get grumpy. It doesn\u2019t have a bad day. The AI is consistent,\u201d says Juan Espinoza, vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech.",
      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",
      "The university declined to comment for this article and referred to its admissions website, which it updated after the criticism. \u201cUNC uses AI programs to provide data points about students\u2019 common application essay and their school transcripts,\u201d the website says. Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application.

      "Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season",
      "NEW YORK -- Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending.",
      "Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted \u201cconversations\u201d with customers.",
      "Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season's most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock.",
      "San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce\u2019s director of consumer insights.",
      "The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer\u2019s website, Schwartz said.",
      "Despite the advancements, AI\u2019s impact on holiday shopping will be \u201crelatively limited\u201d this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner.",
      "\u201cThe more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,\u201d Jashinsky said. \"But customer behavior takes a long time to change.\u201d",
      "Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025:",
      "AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks.",
      "OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for \u201cdetail-heavy\u201d items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said.",
      "Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations.",
      "Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans,",
      "Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed.",
      "\u201cThis is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,\u201d Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart\u2019s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target's app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient.",
      "Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal\u2019s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops.",

      "Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive.",
      "\u201cA lot of consumers that weren\u2019t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,\u201d Goldberg predicted.",
      "Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase.",
      "OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx.",
      "OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart\u2019s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time.",
      "A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app.",

While the services still are limited, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say.",
      "Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an \u201cauto buy\u201d button while setting up price alerts. Once a product's price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said.",
      "The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn't carry a desired item in its store, a \u201cShop Direct\u201d button will take them to the website of a place that does.",
      "Google's AI Mode price tracker also includes a \u201cbuy for me\u201d option that automatically makes a customer's purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers.",
      "Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said.",
      "Google said it's applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans.",

      "A federal judge called out an immigration enforcement agent for using artificial intelligence to write the narrative of a use-of-force report as just a small part of a scathing opinion that rebutted federal officials' narratives about appropriate force...",
      "Tucked in a two-sentence footnote in a voluminous court opinion, a federal judge recently called out immigration agents using artificial intelligence to write use-of-force reports, raising concerns that it could lead to inaccuracies and further erode public confidence in how police have handled the immigration crackdown in the Chicago area and ensuing protests.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis wrote the footnote in a 223-page opinion issued last week, noting that the practice of using ChatGPT to write use-of-force reports undermines the agents\u2019 credibility and \u201cmay explain the inaccuracy of these reports.\u201d She described what she saw in at least one body camera video, writing that an agent asks ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after giving the program a brief sentence of description and several images.",
      "The judge noted factual discrepancies between the official narrative about those law enforcement responses and what body camera footage showed. But experts say the use of AI to write a report that depends on an officer\u2019s specific perspective without using an officer\u2019s actual experience is the worst possible use of the technology and raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy.",
      "Law enforcement agencies across the country have been grappling with how to create guardrails that allow officers to use the increasingly available AI technology while maintaining accuracy, privacy and professionalism. Experts said the example recounted in the opinion didn't meet that challenge.",
      "\u201cWhat this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures \u2014 if that\u2019s true, if that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It\u2019s a nightmare scenario,\u201d said Ian Adams, assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who serves on a task force on artificial intelligence through the Council for Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear if the agency had guidelines or policies on the use of AI by agents. The body camera footage cited in the order has not yet been released.",
      "Adams said few departments have put policies in place, but those that have often prohibit the use of predictive AI when writing reports justifying law enforcement decisions, especially use-of-force reports. Courts have established a standard referred to as objective reasonableness when considering whether a use of force was justified, relying heavily on the perspective of the specific officer in that specific scenario.",
      "\u201cWe need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer to let us know if this was a justified use of force,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts, because you\u2019re begging it to make up facts in this high-stakes situation.\u201d",
      "Besides raising concerns about an AI-generated report inaccurately characterizing what happened, the use of AI also raises potential privacy concerns.",
      "Katie Kinsey, chief of staff and tech policy counsel at the Policing Project at NYU School of Law, said if the agent in the order was using a public ChatGPT version, he probably didn't understand he lost control of the images the moment he uploaded them, allowing them to be part of the public domain and potentially used by bad actors.",
      "Kinsey said from a technology standpoint most departments are building the plane as it\u2019s being flown when it comes to AI. She said it\u2019s often a pattern in law enforcement to wait until new technologies are already being used and in some cases mistakes being made to then talk about putting guidelines or policies in place.",

We can start from transparency.\u201d",
      "Kinsey said while federal law enforcement considers how the technology should be used or not used, it could adopt a policy like those put in place in Utah or California recently, where police reports or communications written using AI have to be labeled.",
      "The photographs the officer used to generate a narrative also caused accuracy concerns for some experts.",
      "Well-known tech companies like Axon have begun offering AI components with their body cameras to assist in writing incident reports. Those AI programs marketed to police operate on a closed system and largely limit themselves to using audio from body cameras to produce narratives because the companies have said programs that attempt to use visuals are not effective enough for use.",
      "\u201cThere are many different ways to describe a color, or a facial expression or any visual component. You could ask any AI expert and they would tell you prompts return very different results between different AI applications, and that gets complicated with a visual component,\u201d said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.",

      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of what they call \u201cmini lightning\u201d over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches (centimeters) in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet (2 meters) of the microphone perched atop the rover\u2019s tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study\u2019s lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\u201cIt opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\u201d Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \u201cIt\u2019s like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\u201d",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\u201cIt really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\u201d Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \u201cI think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning.\u201d",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \u201cmini lightning\u201d based on acoustic and electric signals.",

      "Ukrainians in the southern city of Kherson live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks",
      "KHERSON, Ukraine -- When Olena Horlova leaves home or drives through town outside the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, she fears that she's a target. She believes that Russian drones could be waiting on a rooftop, along the road or aiming for her car.",
      "To protect herself and her two daughters, the girls stay indoors, and she stays alert \u2014 sometimes returning home at night along dark roads without headlights so as not to be seen.",
      "After living through the occupation, refusing to cooperate with Russian forces and hiding from them, Horlova, like so many other residents, found that even after her town was liberated in 2022, the ordeal didn't end.",
      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",
      "\u201cWe live with the hope that one day this will finally end,\u201d Horlova said, her voice trembling. \u201cWhat matters for us is a cease-fire, or for the front line to be pushed further away. Then it would be easier for us.\u201d",
      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

      "\u201cThere were so many drones flying over us,\u201d she said, adding that she rarely left home even after its windows were shattered and boarded up. \u201cPeople there survive, not live. I never thought such a tragedy would happen to me.\u201d",
      "Dr. Yevhen Haran, the hospital\u2019s deputy medical chief, says the injuries from drone strikes range from amputations to fatal wounds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simply hunting for people. There\u2019s no other name for it,\u201d he said.",
      "He says patients wounded in Russian attacks, including drone strikes, arrive at the hospital every day. Last month alone, it treated 85 inpatients and 105 outpatients with blast injuries, all from shelling and drone strikes. It's also the only hospital in the area equipped to handle the most serious cases.",

      "\u201cI pulled in behind them. The drone circled and, on the next pass, flew straight into their vehicle \u2014 the driver\u2019s door,\u201d he recalled. Shrapnel tore through the front car, while his, parked behind, shielded him.",

      "\u201cWe held out until liberation \u2014 we\u2019ll hold out until peace as well,\u201d he said.",

      "LONDON -- The White House said it is \"very optimistic\" ahead of special envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting in Moscow on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as U.S. officials continue their push to end Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "The Kremlin on Tuesday said the meeting was expected to begin at about 5 p.m. local time, or about 9 a.m. ET, and that U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was expected to take part.",
      "The high-stakes sit-down follows a series of meetings between top U.S. and Ukrainian officials, during which the parties sought to revise the original peace-plan proposal presented by the Trump administration to Ukraine last month.",
      "Witkoff and other top U.S. officials -- including Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio -- met on Sunday in Florida with a Ukrainian delegation to attempt to find a deal that Ukraine and Russia might both accept to end the war.",
      "\"I think the administration feels very optimistic,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, following the Florida meeting. \"They had very good talks with the Ukrainians in Florida. And now, of course, Special Envoy\u00a0Witkoff\u00a0is on his way to Russia.\"",
      "The top Ukrainian official at the Florida talks said there had been progress, but, he added, \"some issues still require further refinement.\"",
      "The Kremlin on Monday said a meeting between Witkoff and Putin was scheduled for Tuesday. Putin prepared in recent days by holding meetings with military commanders and a governor of a frontline territory, according to Russian officials.",
      "\"We have no doubt that this will be a very important step towards peace and a peaceful settlement,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday.",
      "There was\u00a0little expectation\u00a0Putin would agree to a deal. The Russian leader signaled last week he would not compromise, repeating in hardline remarks his demand that Ukraine withdraw from territory he claims as Russian soil and saying it was \"pointless\" to negotiate with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Putin then on Monday claimed without evidence that Russian forces had taken control of two Ukrainian cities where intense fighting has been happening for weeks in the eastern part of the country, a move intended perhaps to burnish the perception of Russia's leading position on the battlefield.",
      "Zelenskyy, who, along with Trump, was not directly involved with the talks in Florida, met on Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. The meetings in France were \"substantive and important -- above all, focused on the steps that bring a just peace closer,\" he said on social media. Zelenskyy landed on Tuesday in Dublin, where he's expected to meet with Taoiseach Micheal Martin, the Irish prime minister.",

Ukraine's potential relinquishment of some of its territory to Russia was thought to be part of the talks.",

      "\"Over two very productive days in the United States, we held many hours of meetings and negotiations,\" Umerov said in a separate social media update on Monday. \"We achieved significant progress, although some issues still require further refinement.\"",
      "Umerov and the rest of the negotiating team met with Zelenskyy in person on Tuesday, with the president saying they discussed \"the matters that cannot be addressed over the phone.\" He praised Ukrainian allies for their partnership. And he also accused Russia of beginning new disinformation campaigns prior to Putin's meeting with Witkoff.",
      "\"Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness -- we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security,\" Zelenskyy said on social media. \"This is exactly the level of commitment that must be compelled from the Russian side, and this task can be accomplished only together with our partners.\"",
      "The meeting in Moscow would be the sixth such Witkoff-Putin sit-down this year and it comes amid a redoubled effort by the White House to produce a peace deal in the almost 4-year-old conflict.",
      "The meeting on Sunday included discussions of a revised 19-point peace plan that\u00a0was developed\u00a0a week ago during\u00a0another round of American-Ukrainian talks\u00a0in Geneva, Switzerland. Those talks reworked an earlier 28-point plan that the Trump administration had presented and that had alarmed Kyiv and European allies as heavily favoring Russia.

      "Pope Leo XIV has prayed at the site of the 2020 Beirut port explosion, urging justice for the 218 victims",
      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV prayed Tuesday at the site of a deadly 2020 Beirut port explosion that has become a symbol of dysfunction and official impunity and called for justice to prevail, as he offered words of consolation to Lebanon\u2019s people \u2014 including in the war-battered south \u2014 on the final day of his first overseas trip.",
      "Relatives of some of the 218 people killed by the blast held up photos of their loved ones as Leo arrived at the scorched site. They stood side by side as Leo prayed silently first at a monument to the dead, then greeted each one, grasping their hands.",
      "The emotional encounter took place next to the shell of the last grain silo standing at the site destroyed by the Aug. 4, 2020, blast and the piles of burned cars torched in its wake. The explosion did billions of dollars in damage as hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a port warehouse.",
      "Five years on, the families of those killed are still seeking justice. No official has been convicted in a judicial investigation that has been repeatedly obstructed, angering Lebanese for whom the blast was just the latest evidence of impunity after decades of corruption and financial crimes.",
      "\u201cThe visit clearly sends the message that the explosion was a crime,\" said Cecile Roukoz, whose brother, Joseph Roukoz, was killed and who was on hand to meet the pope. \"There should be a message, the country should end impunity and ensure justice is served.\u201d",
      "When he arrived in Lebanon on Sunday, Leo urged the country's political leaders to pursue the truth as a means of peace and reconciliation. In a homily Sunday after praying at the site, Leo referred explicitly to the blast and called for Lebanon to be a place of justice.",
      "An estimated 150,000 worshippers packed the Beirut waterfront for Leo's final Mass, which he celebrated immediately after praying at the nearby blast site.",
      "In his homily, Leo named the many problems the Lebanese people have faced, from economic crises to the blast and renewed fears of war. He said it\u2019s natural to feel \u201cparalyzed by powerlessness in the face of evil and oppressed by so many difficult situations.\u201d",
      "But he urged them not to be resigned, and to find ways to remain hopeful and grateful. He insisted, though, that justice was part of the equation.",
      "\u201cLet us cast off the armor of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cA Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognize each other as brothers and sisters.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon, stand up! Be a home of justice and fraternity! Be a prophetic sign of peace for the whole of the Levant!\u201d",
      "The American pope opened his final day in Lebanon with an emotional visit to the De La Croix hospital, which specializes in care for people with psychological problems. Awaiting him were some familiar-looking faces: young boys dressed up as Swiss Guards and cardinals, and even one dressed as the pope himself in all white.",
      "The mother superior of the congregation that runs the hospital, Mother Marie Makhlouf, was overcome as she welcomed the pope, telling him that her hospital cares for the \u201cforgotten souls, burdened by their loneliness.\u201d",
      "Leo said the facility stands as a reminder to all of humanity. \u201cWe cannot forget those who are most fragile. We cannot conceive of a society that races ahead at full speed clinging to the false myths of well-being, while at the same time ignoring so many situations of poverty and vulnerability,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor Lebanon, (the visit) means a lot,\" said pilgrim Maggie Claudine, who was waiting for Leo at the hospital. \"We hope that peace will prevail, and that is what we wish for. We want to live in comfort.\u201d",
      "Leo has sought to bring a message of peace to Lebanon as it copes with the economic crises, the aftermath of last year's devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel and the fallout from the port blast.",
      "Among those on hand to welcome Leo at the blast site was Lebanon Social Affairs Minister Haneen Sayed, whose mother was killed. Another was Mireille Khoury, whose 15-year-old son, Elias, was killed.",

The probe has been obstructed by officials who have largely refused to cooperate.",
      "\u201cJustice is the basis of building any country,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview before the pope arrived in Lebanon. \u201cOur children were killed in their homes.

      "The fate of the port\u2019s massive grain silos, which absorbed much of the shock of the explosion, has also been a matter of debate.",

      "A new type of lens approved by the FDA promises to slow nearsightedness in children",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",
      "But Gupta says many parents and physicians are likely to prefer the glasses.",
      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",
      "Under the FDA\u2019s approval decision, the lenses can be prescribed to any child with myopia who\u2019s within the recommended age range. There were no serious side effects, according to FDA, although some children reported visual disturbances, such as halos around objects while wearing the lenses.",

      "During the plea hearing of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, son of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, in Chicago, U.S. prosecutors revealed details of the abduction of Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, a leader of the Sinaloa cartel",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Armed men entered through a window to ambush Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, the most elusive of the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s leaders, who was then loaded onto a plane, drugged and spirited across the border to the United States, according to details revealed Monday in the plea hearing of the drug trafficker who abducted him.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, the 39-year-old son of former Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise in federal court in Chicago after admitting his role in overseeing the transport of tens of thousands of kilograms (pounds) of drugs to the U.S.",
      "As part of that plea agreement, U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions in the hours and days immediately after Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
      "How did the wily drug capo who had stayed ahead of authorities for decades end up in the United States like a present tied with bow?",
      "The plea agreement did not name Zambada, but in the days after his arrest, one of his lawyers shared a letter from him that explained he had been called to a meeting with Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and there he had been abducted.",
      "Andrew Erskine, an attorney representing the U.S. government, said Monday the alleged kidnapping of an unnamed individual was part of an attempt to show cooperation with Washington, which he said did not sanction those actions. He also said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez would not receive cooperation credit because of that.",
      "The arrest of both drug traffickers by U.S. authorities angered Mexico's then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who suspected the U.S. government was behind the operation. Washington denied involvement from the outset, but experts thought it would be virtually impossible to pull off without U.S. authorities having some knowledge.",
      "Erskine described the alleged kidnapping in court, saying Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had the glass from a floor-to-ceiling window removed from a room ahead of the meeting with the unnamed person.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez allegedly had others enter through the open window, seize the individual, put a bag over his head and take him to a plane. On board, he was zip tied and given sedatives before the plane landed at a New Mexico airport near the border with Texas.",
      "Zambada in his letter said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had called him to a meeting on the outskirts of Sinaloa state\u2019s capital, Culiacan, along with some local politicians, one of whom was later found dead.",
      "He said when he arrived there were a lot of armed men in green military uniforms, who he assumed were gunmen for the \u201cChapitos,\u201d as \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons were known. Even though they ran a rival faction within the cartel, Zambada maintained communication with them and appeared to trust Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez enough to follow him into a dark room.",

      "Rather than congratulating or thanking the U.S. for arresting the elusive Zambada, Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office said it was studying the possibility of bringing treason charges against Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez or whoever else aided in the plot.",
      "The arrests set off a bloody fight in Sinaloa among their respective cartel factions for control of the business, violence that L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s successor President Claudia Sheinbaum is still dealing with.",
      "With the plea deal, Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez\u2019s defense attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he is expected to avoid life in prison.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years.",

      "Lebanon fought a brutal 15-year civil war that began 50 years ago in 1975. Since then, it has faced several other conflicts including wars between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

      "The Trump administration has announced new immigration restrictions following the shooting of two National Guard members by a suspect who is an Afghan national",
      "WASHINGTON -- Since last week's shooting of two National Guard members in the nation\u2019s capital by a suspect who is an Afghan national, the Trump administration announced a flurry of policies aimed at making it harder for some foreigners to enter or stay in the country.",
      "The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries \"of concern\u201d and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.",
      "Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.",
      "The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.",
      "The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country \u2014 or are already here \u2014 do not pose a security threat.",
      "Here's a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:",
      "The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused \u201cuntil we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\u201d",
      "Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.",
      "People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.",
      "The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.",
      "The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.",
      "USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn't trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump's January order didn't affect those cases, Edlow's social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency's pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.",
      "Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department's immigration courts.",
      "On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a \u201cfull scale, rigorous reexamination\u201d of every green card for people he said come from \u201cevery country of concern.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmerican safety is non negotiable,\u201d Edlow said.",
      "The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers \u201chigh-risk,\u201d including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.",

      "On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all \u201cimmigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.\u201d That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.",
      "Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.",
      "The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.",
      "But the State Department\u2019s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.",
      "According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.",
      "Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.",
      "That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.",
      "Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.",
      "Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That's nearly 200,000 refugees.",

      "Seventeen mass killings have occurred this year in the U.S., the lowest since 2006",
      "A shooting last weekend at a children\u2019s birthday party in California that left four dead was the 17th mass killing this year \u2014 the lowest number recorded since 2006, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.",
      "Experts warn that the drop doesn't necessarily mean safer days are here to stay and that it could simply represent a return to average levels.",
      "\u201cSir Isaac Newton never studied crime, but he says \u2018What goes up must come down,'\" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. The current drop in numbers is more likely what statisticians call a \u201cregression to the mean,\u201d he said, representing a return to more average crime levels after an unusual spike in mass killings in 2018 and 2019.",
      "\u201cWill 2026 see a decline?\" Fox said. \"I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. What goes down must also go back up.\u201d",
      "The mass killings \u2014 defined as incidents in which four or more people are killed in a 24-hour period, not including the killer \u2014 are tracked in the database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. Fox, who manages the database, says mass killings were down about 24% this year compared to 2024, which was also about a 20% drop compared to 2023.",
      "Mass killings are rare, and that means the numbers are volatile, said James Densley, a professor of at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota.",
      "\u201cBecause there's only a few dozen mass killings in a year, a small change could look like a wave or a collapse,\u201d when really it's just a return to more typical levels, Densley said. \u201c2025 looks really good in historical context, but we can't pretend like that means the problem is gone for good.\u201d",
      "But there are some things that might be contributing to the drop, Densley said, including an overall decline in homicide and violent crime rates, which peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvements in the immediate response to mass shootings and other mass casualty incidents could also be playing a part, he said.",
      "\u201cWe had the horrible Annunciation School shooting here in Minnesota back in August, and that case wouldn't even fit the mass killing definition because there were only two people killed but over 20 injured,\u201d Densley said. \u201cBut I happen to know from the response on the ground here, that the reason only two people were killed is because of the bleeding control and trauma response by the first responders. And it happened on the doorsteps of some of the best children's hospitals in the country.\u201d",
      "Crime is complex, and academics are not great at assessing the reasons behind crime rate changes, said Eric Madfis, a professor of criminal justice at University of Washington-Tacoma.",
      "\u201cIt's multicausal. It's never going to be just one thing. People are still debating why homicide rates went down in the 1990s,\u201d Madfis said. \u201cIt is true that gun violence and gun violence deaths are down, but we still have exceedingly high rates and numbers of mass shootings compared to anywhere else in the world.\"",

That flexibility has been key to reducing gun violence rates, he said.",

It's the first time the Trump-supporting super PAC has spent money on a campaign since last year's presidential race, a reflection of this contest's outsize importance.

Trump addressed the crowd by phone and later held a tele-rally for Van Epps, his second of the general election.",

      "DEDHAM, Mass. -- A Massachusetts man goes on trial Monday in connection with the grisly murder of his wife, who disappeared more than two years ago and whose body has never been found.",
      "Ana Walshe, an immigrant from Serbia, was last seen early on Jan. 1, 2023, following a New Year\u2019s Eve dinner at her Massachusetts home. Her husband, Brian Walshe, faces a first-degree murder charge, after agreeing to plead guilty last month to lesser charges of misleading police and willfully conveying a human body in violation of state law.",
      "Prosecutors have said that starting on the day of Ana Walshe's disappearance and for several days after, Brian Walshe made multiple online searches for \u201cdismemberment and best ways to dispose of a body,\u201d \u201chow long before a body starts to smell\u201d and \u201chacksaw best tool to dismember.\u201d",
      "When questioned by investigators, Walshe said his wife had been called to Washington, D.C., from Massachusetts on New Year\u2019s Day for a work emergency. He didn\u2019t contact her employer until Jan. 4. The company \u2014 the first to notify police that Ana Walshe was missing \u2014 said there was no emergency, prosecutors said.",
      "Investigators said surveillance video showed a man resembling Walshe throwing what appeared to be heavy trash bags into a dumpster not far from their home, and that a search of a trash processing facility near his mother\u2019s home uncovered bags that contained a hatchet, hacksaw, towels and a protective Tyvek suit, cleaning agents, a Prada purse, boots like the ones Ana Walshe was last seen wearing and a COVID-19 vaccination card with her name.",
      "Prosecutors have also said that Ana Walshe had taken out $2.7 million in life insurance naming her husband as the sole beneficiary. The couple, who have three young children now in state custody, lived in the affluent coastal community of Cohasset, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of Boston.",

      "The White House says a Navy admiral ordered a second strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea and insists the September attack that has come under bipartisan scrutiny was lawful",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House said Monday that a Navy admiral acted \u201cwithin his authority and the law\u201d when he ordered a second, follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea in a September U.S. military operation that has come under bipartisan scrutiny.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt offered the justification for the Sept. 2 strike as lawmakers announced there will be congressional review of the U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific Ocean. The lawmakers cited a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for a second strike that killed survivors on the boat.",
      "Navy Vice Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, who Leavitt said ordered the second strike, is expected to provide a classified briefing Thursday to lawmakers overseeing the military.",
      "Leavitt in her comments to reporters did not dispute a Washington Post report that there were survivors after the initial strike. Her explanation came after President Donald Trump a day earlier said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have wanted that \u2014 not a second strike\u201d when asked about the incident.",
      "\u201cSecretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\u201d said Leavitt. \u201cAdmiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\u201d",
      "Late Monday, Hegseth posted: \u201cAdmiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\u201d",
      "A month after the strike, Bradley was promoted from commander of Joint Special Operations Command to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.",
      "Concern over the Trump administration's military strikes against the alleged drug-smuggling boats has been building in Congress, but details of this follow-on strike stunned many lawmakers from both parties and generated stark questions about the legality of the attacks and the overall strategy in the region, and particularly toward Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week\u2019s Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical. Still, they said the reported attacking of survivors of an initial missile strike posed serious concerns and merited further scrutiny.",
      "The White House weighed in after Trump on Sunday vigorously defended Hegseth.",
      "\u201cPete said he did not order the death of those two men,\u201d Trump said. He added, \u201cAnd I believe him.\u201d",
      "Leavitt said Hegseth has spoken with members of Congress who may have expressed some concerns about the reports over the weekend.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also spoke over the weekend with the two Republican and two Democratic lawmakers leading the Senate and House Armed Services committees. He reiterated \u201chis trust and confidence in the experienced commanders at every echelon,\u201d Caine's office said in a statement.",
      "The statement added that the call focused on \u201caddressing the intent and legality of missions to disrupt illicit trafficking networks which threaten the security and stability of the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Monday broadly defended the operations, echoing the Trump administration position that they're necessary to stem the flow of illegal narcotics into the United States.",
      "Thune said the committees in Congress will look into what happened. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to draw any conclusions or deductions until you have all the facts,\u201d he said of the Sept. 2 strike. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where they lead.\u201d",
      "After the Post\u2019s report, Hegseth said Friday on X that \u201cfake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.\u201d",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avatar-fire-and-ash-director-james-cameron-on-generative-ai-thats-horrifying-to-me/",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:44:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Avatar\" director, who uses performance capture to help create fantasy characters, has consistently raised the level of movie visual effects. But James Cameron believes using artificial intelligence to create a character and performance without an actor is \"horrifying.\"",
    "story": [
      "Much of what we see from the Earth-like moon of Pandora, the fantastical setting for the \"Avatar\" franchise, comes from a soundstage in Los Angeles, where scenes from the second and third movies were filmed. \"We had to build an ocean,\" director James Cameron said. \"We could make a two-meter swell. We could make a wave crash up on a shoreline if we built the shoreline.\"",
      "Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Salda\u00f1a  and other actors shot their underwater scenes in the nearly 250,000-gallon tank. Digital artists then took those shots, called performance captures, as a template to render the final versions of the characters we see on screen.",
      "\"So, performance capture, we use a whole bunch of cameras to capture the body performance of the actor,\" Cameron explained. \"And we use a single camera (or now we use actually two) to video their face. They're in a close-up 100% of the time. But there's a beautiful thing about being in a close-up 100% of the time. It's very much like theater rehearsal.\"",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is the third film in the series. It tells the story of the indigenous Na'vis' fight to defend their paradise from colonizing humans.",
      "Cameron created these stories and this world. He's always been a dreamer, even as a kid in rural Canada. \"I lived in a world of my imagination \u2013 it was comic books, it was science fiction. I read a lot. There were movies, TV shows,\" he said. \"I mean, I had a pretty fertile imagination.\"",
      "Cameron moved to Los Angeles with his parents as a teen. He briefly attended community college, where studies included marine biology, before dropping out and picking up odd jobs, including truck driving.",
      "So, how did he go from blue collar to Hollywood? \"Watching 'Star Wars,'\" he said. \"I used to put my headphones on and listen to fast electronic music and imagine space battles, hyperkinetic space battles with all kinds of maneuvers and energy weapons, and people going through debris fields and all that. If the things I'm seeing in my mind can be the same things that are in a movie that's the number one movie in movie history, then I've got a salable imagination.\"",
      "He returned to school, although not in an official capacity. \"I started to study visual effects, and the way I did it was, I didn't have the money to go to USC or anything like that. So what I used to do is, I'd go down to USC, I'd go bury myself on a Saturday, when I wasn't driving a truck, in the stacks. And I'd read everything I could find on optical printing and front-screen projection and, you know, sodium process traveling mattes. All self-taught. I'd Xerox all these scholarly papers, put them all in binders. And I had this shelf full of black binders that had essentially a graduate course in visual effects and cinematography.\"",
      "He found jobs in visual effects departments and production design, rising through the ranks quickly due to his technical knowledge.",
      "Then, in the early 1980s, Cameron, inspired by a literal dream about a robot exoskeleton, co-wrote and directed \"The Terminator.\" The movie put him on the map, and proved he could turn his imagination into reality.",
      "But CGI wasn't available at the time; the effects were done largely through puppeteering. \"We just figured out how to do it all practically,\" Cameron said.",
      "He showed us around his private museum in Los Angeles, full of movie props from his films, including \"Aliens,\" where puppeteers brought Sigourney Weaver's powerlifter - and the Alien Queen \u2013 to life. Of the Alien Queen, Cameron said, \"Her head had, I think, seven or eight different axes of movement that were controlled by cables that went basically out her butt. And we had to hide all that stuff, so there was a lotta steam and smoke and backlight and things like that.\"",
      "Cameron's first use of CGI came with the science fiction movie \"The Abyss,\" It was also his first cinematic foray into another one of his fascinations: the deep sea. His second venture into an oceanic film? \"Titanic.\" It became the then-highest-grossing movie of all time. Cameron took home three Oscars himself.",
      "But the film itself was never the priority for Cameron: He said he wrote the script in order to explore the wreck of the Titanic. \"It was a little bit of a means to an end, you know?\" he said. \"I thought, 'I can just go do this. All right, I need a story. Okay, 'Romeo and Juliet.' You know, young, doomed love on the Titanic.' Boom! Like, instantaneous.\"",
      "He found a way to use Hollywood to invest in his passion for scientific exploration. \"Yeah, exactly,\" he said. \"And then I had so much fun on my expedition that was to shoot Titanic for the movie, that I basically took an eight-year hiatus from Hollywood, an eight-year sabbatical. And I did subsequently six more expeditions for a total of seven, before I started 'Avatar.'\"",
      "Cameron wrote the treatment for \"Avatar\" before \"Titanic,\" but it wasn't until 2005 that he thought the current technology could support his vision. And even then, he wasn't sure the business of Hollywood would go along. \"For years, there was this sense that, 'Oh, they're doing something strange with computers and they're replacing actors,' when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we're doing, it's a celebration of the actor-director moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character,\" he continued. \"They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"",
      "Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" opens next months.",
      "So, how does he feel a few weeks from the premiere? \"Nervous!\" he laughed. \"Are you kidding? Always. Always.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Cameron is still undaunted, and enamored by the unknown. \"I'm attracted, in case you haven't noticed, by things I don't know how to do,\" he said. \"Because you grow and you learn. If I'm still making movies when I got an oxygen tube up my nose and I'm 87 or whatever, should I be that lucky, I want to still be doing things I don't know how to do.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:03:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The heavy metal band has not only changed lives with their music; they've also changed lives with their philanthropy \u2013 from donations to food banks and disaster relief, to their charity, All Within My Hands, which has donated to workforce education and other critical services.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen DeBerry is a newly-minted commercial delivery driver in Baltimore, Maryland. She says having this new job has completely changed her life. \"It feels awesome,\" she said. \"You know, I take care of my daughter, and I also take care of my mother.\"",
      "The commercial driver's license, like the type DeBerry got at the Community College of Baltimore County, can cost up to $7,500, money she didn't have \u2013 which is where four kind of unlikely guys from the Bay Area stepped in.",
      "Yes, we are talking about the guys from the band Metallica, one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, with more than 180 million records sold. \"I mean, to be honest, I didn't know when I first signed up that it was through Metallica; they just called it a scholarship,\" DeBerry said.",
      "A Metallica Scholarship, to be precise, part of the more than $10 million the band's charity All Within My Hands has donated to workforce education, mostly in the form of grants through trade schools and community colleges.",
      "\"Not everyone is built for college, and not everyone needs college,\" said Metallica lead singer James Hetfield. And he should know; he himself is the son of a truck driver, something he's hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"It was very evident during COVID, you know, when we weren't able to go out and do our thing,\" said Hetfield. \"But the plumber, the electrician, the truck driver, the people that needed to help keep America running were there. And thank God for them. You know, my thought is that the next millionaires will be the tradesmen.\"",
      "\"We all came from, I mean, pretty humble beginnings,\" said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, who worked in construction before he became a professional musician. \"At a certain point you realize, like, hey, you know, we're selling tickets, we're doing well, the ship's not sinking. What can we do to make people's lives better?\"",
      "The band's philanthropy actually began with the simple question of what to do with their leftover food backstage at the sports arenas and stadiums they'd been playing. They started donating it to local food banks; then, they starting donating sizable checks to those food banks as well, which turned into disaster relief.",
      "\"It was a bit profound for us because one of the first things that happened was in, maybe 2017, we had the Northern California fires that affected so many people in the Bay Area,\" said guitarist Kirk Hammett. When disaster struck in the band's backyard, that's when he says it hit home: \"And we were able to, like, jump in and, like, really help people right off the bat. And there's been other instances where there's been earthquakes, you know, disasters, people in need of food and medicine. And we've been able to step up and send money, and not just a pittance, but like enough money that makes a difference to, you know, a good group of people who need it.\"",
      "But actually talking about their charity work publicly? That didn't come as easily, says drummer Lars Ulrich. \"We had never screamed from the rooftops about it,\" he said. \"I think instinctively you just want to help. I mean, we all depend on each other \u2013 you know, if you really want to break it down, then you go, humans are herd animals and really thrive, you know, the flock does better when everybody is doing well.\"",
      "Now, if all this doesn't sound very Metallica-like, well, in a way neither does the annual fundraiser concert that they've been putting on in Los Angeles. Last year it raised $3.5 million and brought in some big Metallica admirers, like Aquaman himself Jason Momoa. \"They've kind of been the soundtrack of my life, man. I've kind of discovered them probably when I was ten years old. And I think these are your heroes. These are my heroes.\"",
      "It might come as a surprise to some that a band with songs like \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" spends so much time thinking about how to better other people's lives. But for Hetfield, it's a thought process that comes with age.",
      "\"It seems clearer that we have a purpose,\" he said. \"And that purpose is to bring joy to people on this planet, and absolutely still blows my mind that there's three generations out there, you know, rocking out to 'Master of Puppets.' Like, really? You like this song? Okay! That was written when I was 22 years old, and I was pissed off. But beyond what we've done in the music thing, as you get older, you start to see the world in a different light, you know? My philosophy is, you're climbing to the next layer of the high rise. And the older you get, the better the view is of the world, and what you get to see, and where you can be of service. And this is certainly one of them.\"",
      "Up until now, Hetfield had never actually met a Metallica scholar, but that changed backstage before a show in Landover, Maryland, when a very appreciative Carmen DeBerry stopped by. \"I really think that your scholarship, me telling them about your scholarship, is what got me the job,\" she told Hetfield. \"Because once I told them that I got the Metallica scholarship, they were like, Whaaaaat? I got an entrance, and they took a chance with me. And I appreciate it.\"",
      "\"Right on!\" Hetfield replied.",
      "I asked, \"You're about to go out and play to thousands and thousands of people, and yet you just had a moment of getting to talk to somebody whose life has been significantly changed from All Within My Hands' charity work. What's that feel like?\"",
      "Hetfield replied, \"It is so amazing. We get to go make some people smile out there, deliver the goods by playing songs that saved us in our lives. And then to create a foundation that's giving back to, you know, the blue collar America? We get to go from thousands that are making big noise, that we know we're impacting, but to get a one-on-one, you know, heart-to-heart with somebody whose life you've changed, it changes mine.\"",

    "summary": "From living on her Upstate New York farm, to her roles in movies like the forthcoming \"The Testament of Ann Lee\" and \"The Housemaid,\" to her battling serious anxiety and OCD, the Oscar-nominee reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
    "story": [
      "Breakfast is served on Amanda Seyfried's Upstate New York farm, which means feeding the horses, the goats, and Cliff, a 35-year-old pony. \"I love it,\" Seyfried said, \"'cause nothing else matters, because they need to get fed. It's a responsibility that, like, keeps me focused on what's important.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it about this place that makes you feel whatever it is that it makes you feel?\"",
      "\"I don't know if you know this, but Hollywood is really \u2026 it's tricky, and it's got a lot of personalities,\" Seyfried replied. \"There are a lot of people that are working in a way that doesn't necessarily make it feel like a safe place. This is exactly what I have always wanted.\"",
      "And she's is not merely putting on a show for the cameras. \"Last night it was raining, it was pouring, and I was doing the same ****. I just didn't look this nice!\" she said.",
      "This is where Seyfried lives, but she goes where the work is, and there's been plenty of it \u2013 as Karen, memorably clueless in \"Mean Girls,\" later as Sophie in the mega-hit \"Mamma Mia!\"",
      "A big change of pace came in 2020, starring as early Hollywood actress Marion Davies in \"Mank.\" The film earned Seyfried an Oscar nomination.",
      "She agrees that she wants to be challenged, badly. \"Because here's the thing: the challenge is within a certain parameter. I have had enough therapy and enough insight and perspective to know what happens when I may fall too deep into something, and I have enough tools and support to not let that happen. So, every time I'd say it's a challenge, it's really hard, and I look back and I'm like, I wouldn't want to do that again! But when I'm in it, it's more than a challenge; it's a new life. I'm being born into something \u2013 a new version of myself.\"",
      "Her commitment is right there on the screen in two movies out next month: the psychological thriller \"The Housemaid,\" co-starring Sydney Sweeney; and the dramatic musical \"The Testament of Ann Lee.\"",
      "In that 18th century story, Seyfried plays Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers, a religious sect that embraced equality and chastity, even inside of marriage.",
      "\"Her conviction was everything,\" Seyfried said of Lee. \"The coolest thing about her is that she created a utopia. The idea that we're better off working together as equals, it still rings true to this day. Like, if you take away power and control of each other, there's nothing we can't do.\"",
      "The cast received a long standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, while the role has made Seyfried an Oscar contender.",
      "\"It's like, I worked my ass off in this specific experience, and I worked my ass off throughout my career, and I've stayed true to who I am,\" she said. \"I've definitely changed, and evolved, and become a better person. Do I still make mistakes? Uh-huh, yeah. Do I still make bad choices? Yeah! But I'm human, and I'm, like, doing the best I can. And I'm nice. And I'm f****** nice!\" she laughed. \"'Cause there's no other reason not to be.\"",
      "I can testify, she is \u2026 nice! And refreshingly honest. Raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Seyfried studied acting and music as a kid, did some modeling, too. In high school, she was a regular on the soap opera \"All My Children.\" She was on the show for ten months.",
      "Why'd she leave it? \"Why did I leave? Why did Megan McTavish write me off? I don't know, ask her!\" she laughed.",
      "Getting fired, even at 17, hurt. She figured acting was over, so she enrolled at New York's Fordham University, sort of. \"I, like, took the elevator up, and then I stood there, looked at the elevators, and then I took the escalator down, and then I went home. That was my time at Fordham,\" she laughed.",
      "Immediately after \"college,\" Seyfried landed an audition for \"Mean Girls,\" her first big break. \"Mamma Mia!\" was her second. It led to a sequel, 2018's \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\" \u2026 and maybe a trilogy? Asked if there was going to be a third one, she replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"",
      "\"Do we know anything about the story?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I think if we all decided we'll do it for free, they'll be like, 'Cool. Let's do it tomorrow,'\" she replied. \"I know Judy Craymer, who created it, is working furiously on a script. I just assume it'll happen exactly ten years from when we shot the last one, which was '17. So, we'll shoot it in 2027, out in 2028. Every ten years! I just don't know how they get Meryl back.\"",
      "Well, that is the tricky part, as her character is (spoiler) dead. Evil twin? \"There it is!\" Seyfried smiled.",
      "Some character traits can stay with Seyfried, like the voice of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder convicted of fraud in \"The Dropout\" (2022). The role won Seyfried an Emmy.",
      "Seyfried is candid about everything, including battling serious anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, obstacles she believes help her as an actor. \u00a0\"All the things that I have, I've been diagnosed with, I've been able to channel them in the right ways and take the right medication to use it to my advantage,\" she said, \"and to, like, shut it up when it's no longer helpful, for the most part. And that has helped me. Self-loathing, self-judgment, all that, at times helped me keep my s*** together.\"",
      "Seyfried, who turns 40 this week, is married to actor Thomas Sadowski. They have two children. Her daughter was close by during our conversation, as was a guitar. It's one of many instruments Seyfried  plays.",
      "She was looking right at her daughter as she sang.",
      "Seeing her in own house, this farm upstate, surrounded by family and animals, reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
      "\"It's my world now,\" she said. \"Like, I've been in it for 25 years or whatever. And I, like, totally feel at home in it. And people know me well enough, I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I'm nice to people. I'm not trying to cover up any scandals \u2013 yet! Wait! \u2013 and I'm not trying to, you know, hide or, like, run away from any bad press. So it's like, I've made it easy for myself. So far!\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-stoppard-dies-playwright-shakespeare-in-love/",
    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 20:58:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation.",
    "story": [
      "British playwright Tom Stoppard, who won an Academy Award for the screenplay for 1998's \"Shakespeare In Love,\" has died. He was 88.",
      "United Agents said in a statement Saturday that Stoppard died \"peacefully\" at his home in Dorset in southern England, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language. It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him,\" the statement said.",
      "\"My wife and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our greatest writers, Sir Tom Stoppard,\" King Charles said in a statement. \"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history. We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: \"Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.\"",
      "Stoppard was born in the Czech Republic in 1937. His family fled to Singapore after Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939. He, his brother and their mother fled again when Japanese forces closed in on the city in 1941. His father died trying to leave the city. His mother married an English officer in 1946, and the family moved to postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \"put on Englishness like a coat,\" he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "Stoppard first worked as a journalist before turning to theater in the 1960s. Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968; \"Travesties\" in 1976; \"The Real Thing\" in 1984; \"The Coast of Utopia\" in 2007; and \"Leopoldstadt\" in 2023.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \"A Walk on the Water,\" televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" which reimagined Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN\u00a0and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \"I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\"",
      "That was especially true of his late play \"Leopoldstadt,\" which drew on his own family's story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother's death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually opened on Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \"Parade's End\" (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \"Brazil\" (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), Elizabethan romcom \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code breaking thriller \"Enigma\" (2001) and Russian epic \"Anna Karenina\" (2012).",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",

Lead poisoning can lead to symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, memory loss, and pain or tingling in your hands or feet, among other issues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Children are especially sensitive to lead, which can damage their brains and nervous systems, slowing their growth and development, the agency says. Women of childbearing age and new mothers who are breastfeeding their infants are also at risk for lead poisoning, the FDA notes.",
      "The agency advises consumers who are concerned they may have been exposed to lead to contact their health care provider.",
      "Below are the cookware products the FDA says should be discarded, along with the manufacturer or distributor when that is specified.

    "summary": "Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a critic of government vaccine mandates, has been quietly appointed to one of the CDC's top positions.",
    "story": [
      "Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, a critic of COVID-19 vaccines, has been named second-in-command at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "While there has not been an official announcement about Abraham's role, a CDC spokesperson confirmed with CBS News Atlanta that he was listed in the Atlanta-based agency's address book as principal deputy director. A Health and Human Services spokesperson has also confirmed his appointment.",
      "Abraham, a 70-year-old former Republican congressman and doctor from rural northeast Louisiana, served three terms in the House of Representatives before losing his bid for governor in 2019. He was appointed surgeon general in December 2023.",
      "In February, Abraham ordered his staff to stop engaging in media campaigns and community health fairs to encourage vaccinations, saying in a memo that the Louisiana Department of Health \"will no longer promote mass vaccination.\" The announcement was made the same day that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in to serve as President Trump's health secretary.",
      "In a letter posted on the Louisiana Department of Health's website, Abraham decried \"blanket government mandates\" for vaccines and criticized the CDC's COVID-19 vaccination push, saying individuals should make their own decisions about vaccinations.",
      "\"Government should admit the limitations of its role in people's lives and pull back its tentacles from the practice of medicine,\" Abraham argued.",
      "Dr. Nirav Shah, an epidemiologist who served in the position under former President Biden's administration, criticized the appointment on X.",
      "\"Dr. Abraham has been on the wrong side of several important public health issues over the past decade,\" Shah wrote. \"His track record, which includes undermining confidence in vaccines and minimizing the risk of outbreaks, disqualifies him from steering an agency charged with protecting all Americans.\"",
      "Abraham's appointment comes as Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has intensified attacks on some components used in vaccinations. Earlier this month, a CDC webpage was\u00a0updated with language claiming that studies have not ruled out linking vaccines to the development of autism. Kennedy later told the\u00a0New York Times in an interview that he personally directed the agency to update the page.",
      "The CDC has remained without a permanent director since August, after Kennedy fired\u00a0Dr. Susan Monarez less than a month after the Senate confirmed her to lead the agency. Monarez testified in front of Congress in September that Kennedy had pressured her to change CDC guidance over childhood vaccinations.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:52:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration tapped a Biden-era rule to negotiate lower prices on 15 widely used medications for seniors.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has negotiated lower prices for 15 widely used medications covered by Medicare, with the federal government saying the effort will cut spending on those drugs by 44%, or about $12 billion. So will the initiative help save money for seniors?",
      "That's less clear, given that Medicare enrollees are already protected by a cap on drug costs. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0said Monday the new prices will save the 55 million people enrolled in the Part D pharmaceutical plan a total of about $685 million.",
      "Individuals' out-of-pocket reductions are likely to vary based on whether they use one or more of the drugs covered under the new agreement and if they've reached their annual spending cap. On average, however, with 5.3 million people using the newly discounted drugs, that equates to savings of roughly $129 per Medicare enrollee.",
      "CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the projected individual savings under the new Medicare pricing plan.",
      "The lower drug prices were arranged through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a measure to negotiate prices for some of Medicare's most expensive drugs. Before the 2022 law, Medicare was prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical firms to secure more favorable drug prices for participants in the government health program.",
      "Under the new agreement, lower prices for the 15 drugs will take effect in 2027 for medications bought through Medicare's Part D prescription plan, CMS\u00a0said. The discounts will range from 38% to 85% off the medications' list prices, according to the agency.",
      "The best-known drugs covered by the agreement include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, popular medications used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, while other drugs on the list are used to treat common diseases such as asthma and prostate cancer.",
      "The cost of prescription drugs ranks among the top concerns of seniors, according to AARP.",
      "Starting in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act also introduced a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap for seniors. Because that spending limit is adjusted annually for inflation, it could reach about $2,200 in 2027 based on current trends. Medicare enrollees pay nothing for covered prescriptions above that amount. In other words, the negotiated prices for the 15 drugs could help seniors lower their costs until they hit that threshold.",
      "About 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used the 15 drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes and asthma, CMS said. The medications account for $40.7 billion in spending in Medicare Part D.",
      "Aside from savings that individuals might see on their prescriptions, the lower drug pricing will benefit Medicare itself, Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group for lowering prescription costs, told CBS News.",
      "\"Medicare is using its bargaining power to lower prices on the most expensive drugs covered by the program,\" Basey said. \"The savings gained from the new, lower negotiated prices are what allow the program to pay for the out-of-pocket cap.\"",
      "The program's ability to negotiate drug costs also represents \"the most powerful tool we currently have in place to rein in drug prices and hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable,\" she added.",
      "Medicare's negotiations are separate from deals negotiated by President Trump to lower prices for Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy, announced earlier this month. Under that agreement \u2014 which covers eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and the planned TrumpRX pharmaceutical website \u2014 the monthly cost of the GLP-1 drugs will range from $245 to $350, down from\u00a0as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "However, the price for Medicare enrollees for Wegovy and Ozempic under the earlier deal will be $245, less than the $274 negotiated by CMS. In Monday's announcement, CMS didn't specify how the two programs might work together.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, CMS said the earlier deal's pricing is \"expected to supersede\" the prices stipulated under IRA.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 20:33:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Relief will take time, because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
    "story": [
      "As one of America's coffee capitals, Portland, Oregon, has grounds for worry: coffee prices have soared to historic highs.",
      "\"We have bags of coffee on our menu that are $28.50. That's a lot of money for a bag of coffee,\" said Laila Ghambari, owner of Guilder Coffee Company, a caf\u00e9 that sells specialty coffee.",
      "Ghambari and her brothers practically grew up inside an espresso machine. Her father owned a coffee shop, and Ghambari became the U.S. barista champion in 2014. Now, she's a small business owner grappling with the expense of tariffs, which are still impacting her business even though coffee and other products were granted an exemption last month.",
      "\"Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,\" Ghambari said.",
      "Coffee prices were already high due to supply and demand pressures for premium beans along with climate issues, especially crop-killing frost. The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee hit a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, according to\u00a0the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In December 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, one pound of ground coffee cost a little over $4. And in August, retail coffee prices in the U.S. had jumped 20.9% from the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 the sharpest increase in nearly three decades.",
      "Then, back in April, the U.S. imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 10% on coffee-producing countries. Ghambari said it cost her roughly fifty cents a bag.",
      "Christopher Hendon, a chemistry professor at the University of Oregon   known as \"Dr. Coffee,\" studies the global industry and said the tariffs cost independent coffee operators more than consumers.",
      "\"[The consumer is] probably not feeling it,\" Hendon said. \"You might not care today, because the price didn't change all that much, but you might care if your local caf\u00e9 disappears.\"",
      "Charlie Wicker's company, Trail Head Coffee, roasts green beans into brown ones. Tariffs hit him hard.",
      "\"I had to lay off the two full-time employees. So now it's down to just myself and one part-time employee,\" Wicker said, adding, \"The fact that we're still standing is a function of having a little bit of savings to keep the lights on.\"",
      "Despite the reversal that lifted tariffs on coffee, relief will take time because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
      "Ghambari said it won't be until February when the first import of tariff-free coffees will land in her warehouse.",
      "For Wicker, who delivers to caf\u00e9s, lifting those tariffs could be the coffee break he needs.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:09:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Flyers without Real IDs, passports or other accepted forms of identification will need to pay a $45 fee starting Feb. 1.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",
      "What's an acceptable form of ID?",
      "Travelers with Real IDs or other accepted forms of identification don't have to pay the $45 fee to travel. Here are some of the documents the TSA says can substitute for a Real-ID-compliant driver's license:",
      "State-issued Enhanced Driver's License (EDL) or Enhanced ID (EID)U.S. or foreign government-issued passportU.S. passport cardDHS trusted traveler cards ((Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)U.S. Department of Defense IDPermanent resident cardBorder crossing card",

      "The TSA had previously proposed a rule that would charge travelers without a Real ID an $18 fee at security checkpoints, according to a\u00a0notice\u00a0published in the Federal Register earlier this month.",
      "The cost of getting a Real ID varies by state. New York, for example, has no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the regular cost of getting a driver's license or renewing it, but\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees.",

      "Newell Brands, the maker of Sharpie and Yankee Candle, said Monday it is laying off more than 900 workers, or about 10% of its workforce, as the company seeks to cut costs.",
      "Newell also\u00a0said in a statement that it will close roughly 20 Yankee Candle stores across the U.S. and Canada early next year as part of its cost-cutting plan. The layoffs are set to begin this month, according to the Atlanta-based company. Newell's other brands include Mr. Coffee, Oster, Rubbermaid and Sunbeam.",
      "The publicly listed company, whose shares have fallen nearly 62% this year amid slowing growth, launched a turnaround plan in 2023 as it tries to boost sales. The company has also said it will increase its use of automation and artificial intelligence to boost productivity.",
      "\"We've made meaningful progress executing our strategy and strengthening Newell Brands, but there is more work to do,\" Newell Brands president and CEO Chris Peterson said in a statement. \"This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance.\"",
      "In October, Newell reported third-quarter net sales of $1.8 billion, down 7.2% from the year-ago period. Net income for the quarter rose to $21 million, compared with a net loss of $198 million in the year-ago period.",
      "Newell did not disclose which Yankee Candle stores will close in January of 2026, but said the move \"aligns the brand's footprint with modern consumer shopping behaviors.\"",
      "The company expects to take a charge of up to $90 million to complete the layoffs and store closures, mostly for severance costs. Over the longer term, the plan is expected to generate cost savings of up to $130 million.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

      "Bitcoin's plunge pulled other crypto-related stocks down with it, including mobile trading platform Robinhood, which tumbled 3.5%, and Coinbase, which lost 4.2%. Other leading digital currencies, including ethereum and XRP, also sank.",
      "Why are crypto prices sliding?",
      "Experts who spoke to CBS News said global economic developments are weighing on the crypto sector. Bitcoin prices sank after a Bank of Japan official hinted at a possible interest rate hike at its upcoming meeting on Dec. 18-19. Higher interest rates tend to stoke market demand for safer assets, while putting pressure on riskier investments, including crypto.",
      "\"$BTC dumped [because] BOJ put Dec rate hike in play,\" Arthur Hayes, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, wrote on X early Monday.",
      "The selloff is also part of a broader decrease in risk appetite that is reverberating across other tech stocks, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory group deVere Group. He noted that bitcoin's performance has mirrored that of the Nasdaq Composite, where a 4% pullback in tech has translated into a near 30% drop in the value of bitcoin.",
      "\"Bitcoin has increasingly behaved as a leading indicator for broader risk assets, particularly U.S. technology stocks,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve rate decision on Dec. 9-10, with investors expecting policymakers to again lower the Fed's benchmark interest rate. The likelihood of a rate cut now stands at 87%, according to CME FedWatch.",
      "While the market is pricing in a Fed rate cut, it could be accompanied by more hawkish forward guidance, which could hurt risk assets like bitcoin, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "\"There's a lot of moving pieces beyond just the actual policy decision,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "Despite the slump in bitcoin, some experts maintain a bullish outlook. Eric Schiffer, CEO of the Patriarch Organization, \u00a0a private equity firm, said he expects a rebound next year as the Fed further eases interest rates.",

    "summary": "A long-lost painting by 17th-century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens sold at auction for well beyond its asking price.",
    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",
      "A flurry of paintings by famous artists have sold at auctions in recent days.",
      "Last week, a previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million at a Paris auction.",
      "Also in November, a self-portrait by celebrated Mexican artist Frida Kahlo\u00a0sold for $54.66 million\u00a0in New York, a record for a painting by a woman. Two nights before that, a Gustav Klimt canvas\u00a0fetched $236.4 million\u00a0\u2014 a record for a modern art piece.",

      "\"All impacted U.S. carriers have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work,\" Duffy said.",
      "The emergency update stems from an incident Oct. 30 when a JetBlue flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced an issue with its flight controls. The plane dropped about 100 feet in seven seconds, according to preliminary flight data from Flightradar24, and was diverted to Tampa, Florida.",
      "Between 15 and 20 people were injured and taken to area hospitals upon\u00a0landing, according to Vivian Shedd, a spokesperson for Tampa Fire Rescue.",
      "Airbus identified an apparent issue relating to \"intense solar radiation,\" which \"may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\" and recommended an emergency software update to the A320 family of aircraft \u2013 a common passenger plane for U.S. carriers.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued emergency orders Friday that grounded the affected planes. The EU safety agency's order took effect Saturday at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, meaning planes awaiting the updates would be essentially grounded. The order allows for the planes to be flown up to three times without passengers to get them to a location for the fix.",
      "The software change comes as U.S. passengers were beginning to head home from the Thanksgiving holiday, which is the busiest travel time in the country. More than 500 U.S.-registered aircraft will be impacted, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Several U.S. carriers use the Airbus A320 family in their fleet. Spirit and Frontier only fly the A320 family of planes, with many popular carriers maintaining several hundred in their fleet. Delta flies about 315 A320 jets, United has about 200 planes and American has around 480 planes.",
      "United told CBS News the order impacts six aircraft in its Airbus fleet. Delta expects only a small portion of its A320 fleet, less than 50 aircraft, to be impacted by the updates.",
      "American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News Friday evening that it had downgraded the number of impacted aircraft from more than 340 to 209, and that it expected the majority of those 209 to be updated by Friday \"and through the night.\"",
      "\"All aircraft will be completed ahead of the EASA Emergency Airworthiness Directive taking effect tomorrow at 6 p.m. CT,\" American said in a statement.",
      "Hawaii Airlines said it was unaffected.",
      "Internationally, Japan's All Nippon Airways canceled 65 domestic flights on Saturday and said further cancellations were possible. Air India said on X that it had completed the reset on more than 40% of the planes that needed it, and that there were no cancellations so far. France's transport minister said the issue had a limited impact in the country. Disruptions were also minimal in the U.K., Germany and Scandinavia.",
      "Airlines for America, the trade association for the leading U.S. airlines, predicted that carriers will fly a record 31 million passengers from last Friday, Nov. 21, through this coming Monday. The FAA says it expects this year's Thanksgiving holiday travel period to be the busiest in 15 years.",

    "summary": "Shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday despite wider economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year's holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday \u2014 spending billions of dollars both in stores and online.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. It was a slight increase from the company's spending estimate of $11.7 billion.",
      "Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute. Mobile shopping was estimated to drive more than half of all sales, according to Adobe.",
      "Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said.",
      "In-store traffic continues to dwindle",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and $79 billion globally. And e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $6.2 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute - with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes - or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers.",
      "As a result, in-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that U.S. Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024.",
      "But \"the story isn't just that shoppers stayed home; it's that they're changing how and when they shop,\" Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext said in emailed comments on Saturday. He explained that customers are now spreading out purchases over a longer time frame and \"walking into stores with a far narrower mission than we've seen in past holiday seasons.\"",
      "Black Friday remains a major date on retailers' calendar - and Shasteen added that Friday's drop is \"notably better\" than a sharper 6.2% decline RetailNext saw in in-store traffic for the days leading up to Thanksgiving. This indicates that, while shoppers remain cautious and are pulling back on in-store spending overall, \"they're still willing to show up for the biggest promotional moments,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect heightened holiday spending to continue through the weekend. In terms of e-commerce, Adobe expects U.S. shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday - before reaching an estimated $14.2 billion peak on Cyber Monday, which would mark yet another record.",
      "Tariffs create strain on businesses and households",
      "Still, rising prices could be contributing to some of those numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs\u00a0on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. The federal government had raised $195 billion in customs duties for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "Despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%.",
      "This year's holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security - amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",
      "For the November-December holiday season overall, the National Retail Federation estimates U.S. shoppers will spend more than $1 trillion for the first time this year. But the rate of growth is slowing - with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024's holiday season.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies on other short-term loans have been rising. And more and more shoppers are turning to \"buy now, pay later\" plans, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks gained in a short Friday session to close near a record high, capping a five-day rally that helped the S&P 500 index erase nearly all its losses from earlier in the month.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 36 points, or 0.5%, to close at 6,849, 42 points shy of its Oct. 28 record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 289 points, or 0.6%, to close at 47,716. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on Friday but ended November with a decline of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks.",
      "Stock indexes closed at 1 p.m. EDT on Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "The multi-day rebound came after a largely volatile month for stocks, sparked by concerns about a possible bubble in artificial intelligence and tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle tumbled 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.",
      "\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.",
      "Some investors have expressed worry that an AI bubble\u00a0could burst, triggering devastating financial losses. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals.",
      "Some tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.",
      "The market turned around on hopes that the Federal Reserve would again cut interest rates at its meeting next month. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence that the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10.",
      "Traders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.",
      "The minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.",
      "Investors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event. Macy's fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.",
      "Amid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.",
      "Earlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.",

      "As millions of Americans search apps and websites for deals, experts warn that consumers should be on the lookout for fraudsters who will try to capitalize on the holiday shopping rush.",
      "\"Limited time only, gotta do it now, before it sells out, whatever it is. That whole sense of urgency is something bad guys love,\" Lisa Plaggemier, executive director of the National Cybersecurity Alliance,\u00a0told CBS News Texas.",
      "Fake QR codes, phony social media posts and phishing emails are just some of the tools scammers use to lure consumers into unwittingly forking over their information.",
      "To pull off their schemes, fraudsters are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence. One common scam is creating \"deepfakes\" \u2014 videos that appear to be a celebrity or influencer promoting a product but are in fact a dupe \u2014 to bait people into visiting counterfeit websites. That means that what you see may not be what you get.",
      "Once there, fraudsters can steal both your payment information and your personal credentials.",
      "\"You can't rely on your eyes and ears anymore,\" Plaggemier said.",

      "Here are some tips to avoid scams if you're planning to make online purchases on Black Friday.",
      "Check the URL to make sure it's from a reputable retailer. Scammers often create fake websites that mirror other businesses' URLs. The fake ones, however, will contain misspellings or extra numbers and letters. For example, a fraudster might use the lookalike URL be5tbuy.com to mimic bestbuy.com, according to LifeLock. If something seems amiss, take a moment to reconsider your purchase.\u00a0Use a credit card.\u00a0Experts say using a credit card can better protect against fraud. With debit cards, the onus falls on you to get your money back, according to NerdWallet, a personal finance website. With credit cards, it's up to the card issuer to get the money back, meaning the consumer faces less legwork and an easier path to getting a refund. Whatever card you use, experts encourage shoppers to track their purchase history to make sure nothing is amiss.\u00a0Be skeptical of offers or discounts that seem too good to be true. Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce, told CBS News in an email that shoppers should verify offers directly on the retailer's web page.Read the fine print.\u00a0While it may be easy to skim over purchase details, experts encourage shoppers to give them some extra attention. Melanie McGovern, the director of public relations and social media at the nonprofit Better Business Bureau, told CBS News Texas that shoppers should check shipping dates, return policies and \u00a0restocking dates for sold-out items. \"Just doing general things before you make that purchase will help you to make sure you get the item before the holidays,\" she told CBS News Texas.Use the Better Business Bureau's Scam Tracker.\u00a0The tool lets you report scams and read those documented by other consumers, helping you avoid falling for the same tactics.Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages.\u00a0Scammers often send messages that appear to come from a legitimate company, urging you to take an action such as updating your payment information.

    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers about 19 types of cookware that may contain lead, increasing the risk that the toxic metal could wind up in people's food.",
      "Consumers should check whether they have the items in their homes, and throw them away if they do, the FDA said in an alert posted on its website.",
      "\"Do not donate or refurbish this cookware,\" the agency noted.",
      "The suspect cookware, all manufactured outside the U.S. and mostly in India, is made from aluminum, aluminum alloys and brass that have been tested by the FDA and state agencies, with the results showing that they can leach lead into food.",
      "The FDA's warning expands on its August alert about the cookware, with the agency adding nine products to its list of items to discard due to the risk of lead exposure.",
      "According to the FDA, any exposure to lead is considered unsafe, with even low levels of exposure potentially causing serious health problems. Lead poisoning can lead to symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, memory loss, and pain or tingling in your hands or feet, among other issues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Children are especially sensitive to lead, which can damage their brains and nervous systems, slowing their growth and development, the agency says. Women of childbearing age and new mothers who are breastfeeding their infants are also at risk for lead poisoning, the FDA notes.",
      "The agency advises consumers who are concerned they may have been exposed to lead to contact their health care provider.",
      "Below are the cookware products the FDA says should be discarded, along with the manufacturer or distributor when that is specified. The items were sold by a handful of retailers in states including California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, as well as Washington, D.C. The FDA didn't specify if the products were sold more widely, but noted that other items could be added to its alert.",

    "story": [
      "Discounts and deals abound around Thanksgiving, but other days may offer better prices for holiday shopping, according to retail experts.",
      "This year may be a mixed bag for discounts, as some business owners have told CBS News that rising costs are giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales. Still, holiday spending this year could top $1 trillion for the first time, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation, which expects roughly 187 million people to shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year.",
      "So far in 2025, consumer spending has been driven by high-earning households, while low- and middle-income families are feeling pinched by inflation and affordability pressures, economic research shows.",
      "Here's when to expect the best Black Friday weekend deals, broken down by product category.",
      "Shop in-store for big appliances",
      "Looking to buy a big appliance, like a refrigerator, washing machine, or kitchen appliance? It's best to shop in person at brick-and-mortar stores on Black Friday, according to Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, a provider of retail research.",
      "\"We expect to see lots of promotions that are unique to in-store purchases at retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Shoppers should also head to retailers early, because inventory could be limited. Additionally, she expects retailers to adjust pricing in real time, based on consumer demand. Promotions could even vary on a store-by-store basis, depending on inventory levels, Weinswig noted.",
      "When to find travel deals",
      "While the Tuesday after Thanksgiving has been dubbed \"Travel Tuesday,\" it's not necessarily the cheapest time to book. Instead, consumers should start looking for deals as early as Thursday evening, said Julian Kheel, founder of Points Path, a flight search engine.",
      "The best way to keep on top of such promotions is to sign up for your favorite airline or hotel's email alerts, Kheel said. You can always unsubscribe after you've made a reservation, he notes.",
      "\"Most companies will try to get ahead of the competition by launching sales by the morning of Black Friday at the latest,\" he said. \"So don't wait until late Tuesday to look for a great travel deal.\"",
      "Deals on consumer electronics",
      "Cyber Monday is expected to be the best day to find deals on consumer electronics like TVs, speakers, computers and more, according to Adobe Digital Insights analyst Vivek Panyda.",
      "\"We'll see discounts in the range of 10% to 28%,\" he told CBS News.",
      "When to buy toys",
      "Black Friday will provide the lowest prices for popular kids' toys, according to retail analysts. It won't pay to wait later than that for deals, especially on hot items like Legos and Labubu dolls that tend to fly off shelves quickly, according to Pandya.",
      "Marshal Cohen, retail advisor at Circana, also advised that consumers should look beyond advertised prices and comparison shop for additional savings.",
      "\"Retailers are competing with so much of the same product,\" he said. \"So don't just rely on the ad you get. Take time to comparison shop and make sure it's really going to be the best price.\"",

      "Butler said his company has had to pass along some costs to consumers. He estimated that 85% of Americans still choose artificial Christmas trees over real ones, and said he's actively lobbying lawmakers to push for tariff relief. He says the price of an approximately $100 artificial tree has risen about $10 to $15 due to tariffs.",
      "\"We want to be treated the same as bananas, coffee, mangoes, etc.,\" Butler said, in reference to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump earlier this month that exempts products including beef, coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, cocoa and certain spices from the new tariffs. \"Those things are not grown in the U.S. We know that those are now being exempted.

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",

      "Trump backs candidate, claims effort to \"change the results\"",
      "Days before the vote, former Tegucigalpa mayor Asfura won Mr. Trump's backing \u2014 as the U.S. president sought to put his finger on the scale of another Latin American election.",
      "In a Monday post on his own Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump accused the Honduran electoral body of \"trying to change the results\" of the vote, adding: \"If they do, there will be hell to pay!\"",
      "He claimed that the CNE had \"abruptly stopped counting\" ballots on the night of the election when the initial count \"showed a close race between\" Asfura and Nasralla, noting the slight lead that tally showed for Asfura.",

      "Ally Javier Milei came out on top in Argentina's mid-term elections, but it is not yet clear if Mr. Trump's endorsement will be enough to secure victory for Asfura, whose campaign slogan was: \"Grandad, at your service!\"",
      "Could Trump help swing Honduras back to the right?",
      "The election is a clear defeat for ruling leftists trailing far behind in the vote count. A swing to the right could help build U.S. influence in a country that under leftist government had looked increasingly to China.",

      "Hernandez, who has always maintained his innocence, is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the United States, where he was convicted of belonging to one of \"the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world.\"",

      "Many Hondurans have fled north to escape grinding poverty and violence, including minors fearing forced recruitment by gangs.",
      "This escape route has been made more difficult by Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, and nearly 30,000 Honduran migrants have been deported from the U.S. since his second term started in January.",

    "summary": "Some state proposals would use funds from $50 billion rural health program to start drone delivery of medications or to bring telehealth to libraries, day cares and senior centers.",
    "story": [
      "Medication-delivering drones and telehealth at local libraries are among the ideas state leaders revealed in November for spending their share of a $50 billion federal rural health program.",
      "The Trump administration, which has promised \"radical transparency,\" said in an FAQ that it plans to publish the \"project summary\" for states that win awards. Following the lead of federal regulators, many states are withholding their complete applications, and some have refused to release any details.",
      "\"Let's be clear,\" said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association. \"The hospital CEOs, the clinic administrators, the community leaders: They're going to want to know what their states are doing.\" The NRHA's members include struggling rural hospitals and clinics, which federal lawmakers promised would benefit from the Trump administration's Rural Health Transformation Program.",
      "Morgan said his members are interested in what states propose, which of their ideas are approved or rejected, and their budget narratives, which detail how the money could be spent.",
      "Improving rural health care is an \"insanely complicated and difficult task,\" Morgan said.",
      "The five-year Rural Health Transformation Program was approved by Congress in a law \u2014 the One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 that also drastically cuts Medicaid spending, on which rural providers heavily depend. It's being watched closely because it's a much-needed influx of funds \u2014 with a caveat from the Trump administration that the money be spent on transformational ideas, not just to prop up ailing rural hospitals.",
      "The law says half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application. The rest will be distributed through a points-based system. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that, in part, mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly promised to open the government to the American people. His agency has a webpage devoted to \"radical transparency.\"",
      "\"We're working to make this the most transparent HHS in its 70-year history,\" Kennedy said in written testimony to lawmakers in September.",
      "Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University, said HHS is \"acting in a way that utterly lacks transparency\" and that the public has the right to demand \"greater openness and clarity.\" Without transparency, the public cannot hold HHS accountable, he said.",
      "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services spokesperson Catherine Howden said the agency will follow the federal regulations governing competitive grant materials when releasing information about the rural health program.",
      "Grant applications are \"not released to the public during the merit review process,\" Howden said, adding, \"The purpose of this policy is to protect the integrity of evaluations, applicant confidentiality, and the competitive nature of the process.\"",
      "Democrats and many health care advocates are concerned politics will affect how much money states get.",
      "\"I am very concerned about retaliation,\" said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). Because Democrats control her state's politics, \"our application might not be as seriously considered as other states that have Republican leadership,\" she added.",
      "Illinois' Democratic members of the U.S. House sent a letter to CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz in November asking for \"full and fair consideration\" of their state application. Illinois officials have not yet released their state's proposal to KFF Health News, which has a pending public records request.",
      "Heather Howard, a professor of the practice at Princeton University, said she is \"pleasantly surprised at how transparent the states have been.\"",
      "Howard directs the university's State Health and Value Strategies program, which is tracking the rural health fund, and praised most states for publicly posting their project summaries.",
      "\"To me, it speaks to the intense interest in this program,\" Howard said. Her team, reviewing about two dozen state summaries, found themes including expansion of home-based and mobile services, increased use of technology, and workforce development initiatives like scholarships, signing bonuses, and child care assistance for high-demand positions.",
      "\"I think it's exciting,\" Howard said. \"What's great here is the experimentation we're going to learn from.\"",
      "Telerobotics appeared in Georgia's and Alabama's applications, she said, including a proposal to use robotic equipment for remote ultrasounds.",
      "Another theme that \"warms my heart,\" Howard said, was the effort among states to create advisory groups or committees, including in Idaho, where work groups are expected to focus on technology, workforce development, tribal collaboration, and behavioral health.",
      "All 50 states submitted applications to federal regulators by the Nov. 5 deadline and awards will be announced by the end of the year, according to CMS.",
      "As of late November, nearly 40 states had released their project narrative, the main part of the application, which describes proposed initiatives, according to KFF Health News tracking. More than a dozen states have also released their budget narratives.",
      "A handful of states \u2014 Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Wyoming \u2014 released all parts of the application.",
      "KFF Health News filed public records requests for states' complete applications. Some states have refused to release any of their application materials.",
      "Nebraska, for example, rejected a public records request, saying its application materials are \"proprietary or commercial information\" that \"would give advantage to business competitors.\"",
      "Kentucky shared its application summary but said the remainder of the application is a \"preliminary draft\" not subject to release under state laws.",
      "Erika Engle, a spokesperson for Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, said the governor \"is committed to transparency\" but declined to share any of the state's proposal.",
      "Hawaii and other states are still processing formal public records requests.",
      "The rural health program is part of the July law projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years.",
      "Those cuts are expected to affect rural health facilities' bottom lines, threatening their ability to stay open. A recent Commonwealth Fund report found that rural areas continue to lack access to primary care. But the guidelines for the rural health program say states can use only 15% of their new funding to pay providers for patient care.",
      "Between the Medicaid cuts and funding boost from the new program, \"there's real opportunity for national policy to impact rural, both in the negative and the positive potentially,\" said Celli Horstman, a senior research associate at the New York-based policy think tank who co-authored the report.",
      "Among the publicly available rural health transformation proposals, Democratic-leaning states show support, or are willing to adopt, some of the administration's goals but will lose out on points from eschewing others.",
      "For example, New Mexico said it would introduce legislation requiring students to take the Presidential Fitness Test and physicians to complete continuing education courses on nutrition. But it won't prevent people from using their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to buy \"non-nutritious\" foods such as soda and candy.",
      "Many states want to invest in technology, including telehealth, cybersecurity, and remote patient monitoring equipment. Other themes include increasing access to healthy food, improving emergency services, preventing and managing chronic illnesses, and enlisting community health workers and paramedics for home visits.",
      "Specific proposals include:",
      "Arkansas wants to spend $5 million through its \"FAITH\" program \u2014 Faith-based Access, Interventions, Transportation, & Health \u2014 to enlist rural religious institutions to host education and preventive screening events. Congregations could also install walking circuits and fitness equipment.Alaska, which historically relied on dogsled teams to bring medication to remote areas, is looking to test the use of \"unmanned aerial systems\" to speed up pharmacy deliveries to such communities.Tennessee wants to increase access to healthy activities by spending money on parks, trails, and farmers markets.Maryland wants to start mobile markets and install refrigerators and freezers to improve access to fresh, healthy food that often spoils in rural areas with few grocery stores.",

    "story": [
      "The Canadian publishing house behind the \"Franklin\" children's books appeared to condemn Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Monday, after the top military official posted a cartoon image of the famous anthropomorphic turtle blowing up an apparent drug boat.",
      "Hegseth's post \u2014 which shows Franklin shooting a rocket-propelled grenade from a helicopter, with the faux book title \"Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists\" \u2014 appeared on the defense secretary's X account Sunday evening, as questions swirled about the Trump administration's monthslong campaign of boat strikes around South America, and specifically a reported second strike targeting survivors who were in the water.",
      "A day later, Toronto-based Kids Can Press said in a statement posted to social media: \"Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity. We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values.\"",
      "Kids Can Press is the publisher of more than a dozen picture books that depict Franklin navigating life with his parents and friends, with titles like \"Franklin Rides a Bike,\" \"Franklin Goes to School\" and \"Franklin Goes to the Hospital.\" The stories have also been adapted for TV.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Kids Can Press for comment. In a statement Monday night, Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told CBS News: \"We doubt Franklin the Turtle wants to be inclusive of drug cartels... or laud the kindness and empathy of narco-terrorists.\"",
      "For your Christmas wish list\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pLXzg20SaL",
      "Hegseth's post drew flak earlier Monday from Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a retired Navy captain who is\u00a0facing a controversial investigation by the Pentagon\u00a0for participating in a video that encouraged service members not to obey illegal orders.",
      "\"He is in the national command authority for nuclear weapons, and last night he's putting out, on the internet, turtles with rocket-propelled grenades,\" Kelly told reporters. \"I mean, have you seen this? This is the secretary of defense. This is not a serious person.\"",
      "Days before Hegseth's post, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. military carried out more than one strike on a single boat on Sept. 2, killing two survivors from the initial attack after Hegseth allegedly ordered the military to kill everybody onboard. The White House confirmed Monday that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers have argued the second strike may have been a war crime, pointing to domestic and international laws forbidding military forces from attacking wounded people who no longer pose a threat. One Pentagon manual says \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" combatants should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has said its boat attacks have complied with the law and argues that the strikes are necessary to crack down on drug trafficking.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday that Adm. Frank Bradley, who commanded the Sept. 2 operation, \"worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were scheduled to attend what sources described as a decisional meeting regarding the next steps in the escalating pressure campaign against the Maduro regime.",
      "Mr. Trump said recently he's spoken with Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, while the U.S. president has also built up a significant military force in the region as a part of what he's described as an anti-drug campaign against the cartels his administration has designated as terror groups. The State Department has designated Maduro himself as a terrorist.",
      "CNN was first to report the meeting, which comes amid the president's looming threats of military action on land and intensifying scrutiny by lawmakers over the Pentagon's lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Monday that the president would meet with his national security team on Venezuela and \"on many matters.\" Details on the planned meeting have not emerged.",
      "The Washington Post reported Friday that Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors in the first U.S. strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean. The U.S. attack on the vessel was announced by Mr. Trump on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the initial strike left two survivors in the water, and the commander of the operation then ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the survivors.",
      "A working group of former judge advocates general said that if this is true, it would constitute \"war crimes, murder, or both.\" The group pointed to the Geneva Conventions, which says that members of armed forces who are out of the fight because of \"sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely,\" and acts including \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds\" are banned. The U.S. military has killed at least 80 people in boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific in \"Operation Southern Spear,\" which it says is targeting narco-terrorists.",
      "The JAG group called on Congress to probe any use of the military involving \"the intentional targeting of anyone \u2013 enemy combatants, non-combatants, or civilians \u2013 rendered hors de combat (\"out of the fight\") as a result of their wounds or the destruction of the ship or aircraft carrying them.\"",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a reported second strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year, while pledging to look into the incident.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine and if there were two people around,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One. \"But Pete said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was also asked Monday evening about whether he has confidence in Hegseth and about the boat strike.",
      "\"The question will be based on the facts as we find them out,\" he responded. \"We're going to have some discussions within the committee. Until such times we know the full facts, we won't be making comment.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said that Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\" But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed, adding that he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump warned that Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed, and Venezuela said the U.S. had unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and wants to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace.\"",
      "The Trump administration says it's aiming to stop drugs from being smuggled into the U.S., while Venezuela says Mr. Trump seeks Maduro's ouster. Over the past several weeks, the U.S. has moved a number of military ships to the western Atlantic and the Caribbean and reopened a naval base in Puerto Rico.",
      "On Sunday, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
      "\"If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "The Trump administration is looking into whether Minnesota tax money found its way to al Shabaab, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and al Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday.",
      "Bessent wrote on X that the Treasury is \"investigating allegations that under the feckless mismanagement of the Biden Administration and Governor Tim Walz, hardworking Minnesotans' tax dollars may have been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab.\"",
      "The Treasury secretary shared a Nov. 19 report in the conservative publication City Journal that alleged millions of dollars from Minnesota state welfare programs had \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources. Several Minnesota Republicans, including Rep. Tom Emmer, pushed federal prosecutors to look into the allegations.",
      "Walz's office pointed CBS News to remarks last week in which the governor said he welcomes an investigation into where defrauded welfare money went and would work with investigators.",
      "Minnesota has been racked by allegations of large-scale fraud in the state's public assistance programs. Dozens of people have been charged in a $250 million scheme involving the nonprofit group Feeding Our Future and its partners, which federal prosecutors say stole federal nutrition aid by falsely claiming to help distribute meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials have also brought fraud charges involving housing aid and autism programs in the state.",
      "Many of the defendants in these alleged fraud schemes are members of Minnesota's large Somali community, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office wrote in an opinion piece last year. The former investigator, Kayseh Magan, added that community members are also frequently victims of the schemes.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly lashed out against Somali immigrants in Minnesota, claiming in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" and announcing an end to temporary deportation protections for Somali people in the midwestern state. Last week, the president alleged, without evidence, that \"hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country and ripping apart that once great state.\"",
      "Walz and other Minnesota Democrats have defended the state's Somali community. The governor told reporters last month, in response to the claims about al Shabaab: \"Do not paint an entire group of people with that same brush, demonizing them, putting them at risk, when there is no proof of that.\"",
      "Claims that state money could be flowing to al Shabaab and other terror groups have circulated for years in Minnesota. A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that Child Care Assistance Program funding is going to terrorist groups, though the organization didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have been sent overseas and eventually found its way to terrorists.",

      "The U.S. backed a peace proposal to end Russia's war on Ukraine last month, although much more work remains to be done. Putin has called U.S. proposals a \"set of issues put forward for discussion\" rather than a draft agreement. Last week, Mr. Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement,\" after a U.S. official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend that the U.S.-backed plan, which was originally 28 points, has evolved, after some alleged it was heavily slanted toward Russia's priorities, with one provision calling for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Those two things aren't going to be seen as concessions to European leaders, who believe Russia should give back Ukrainian territory it has occupied. Ukraine has also pushed for security guarantees as part of any deal to end the war, though Russia has rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, which would obligate the U.S. and other member states to come to its defense.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Florida for the talks with the Ukrainians over the weekend, called the conversations with the Ukrainians \"another very productive session\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "\"We don't just want to end the war. We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever,\" he said. \"So never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity. It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity.\"",
      "On Sunday, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio voiced concerns that the White House approach could be too pro-Russia.",
      "Asked by CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America First and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "Peace is far from a reality on the ground in Ukraine, as Russian missiles rained down again on Kyiv over the weekend, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from western Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered high praise for Witkoff's negotiating skills and personable nature, and given him an increasingly large portfolio.

The Post reported that the first strike left two men alive in the water. The paper said the commander of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley, ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the two. CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",

    "summary": "The shooting raised questions about whether the government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
    "story": [
      "The shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week has sparked a national debate about U.S. immigration policy and whether the federal government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, identified by authorities as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, to further expand its government-wide immigration crackdown. The administration has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, ordered a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries and frozen all asylum case decisions.",
      "Lakanwal's exact motives remain unclear. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health deteriorated in recent years, and that he became isolated and detached from his family.",
      "Trump administration officials have blamed the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. in 2021, while critics of President Trump have faulted his government for approving his asylum case earlier this year. But a review of Lakanwal's immigration case, based on conversations with U.S. officials and other official sources, shows there were several opportunities for federal authorities, under both administrations, to vet Lakanwal and identify any potentially concerning information.",
      "This is what we know about the immigration process Lakanwal underwent to enter the U.S. and to try to remain here permanently.",
      "September 2021: Lakanwal arrives in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in September 2021 as part of \"Operation Allies Welcome,\" the Biden administration's effort to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees airlifted from Kabul following the chaotic American military withdrawal and Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.",
      "U.S. officials familiar with his case told CBS News that Lakanwal was granted humanitarian parole. Government statistics show parole was offered to more than 77,000 evacuees so they could live and work in the country legally for two-year increments. Parole was designed to be a stopgap measure while the evacuees applied for permanent forms of legal status, such as asylum or Special Immigrant Visas for those who assisted the American war effort.",
      "All Afghan evacuees were supposed to undergo an initial round of vetting at military bases in Italy, Germany, Qatar, Spain and the United Arab Emirates before being allowed to enter the U.S. Those who raised security concerns were sent to Kosovo. After arriving in the U.S., many evacuees were housed in American military bases in several states before settling in communities throughout the country.",
      "At the time, Republican lawmakers in Congress raised concerns about the vetting process undertaken by the Biden administration during the Afghan resettlement effort. A 2022 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General said the screening process encountered several obstacles and that some federal officials \"did not always have critical data\" to properly vet the evacuees.",
      "December 2024: Lakanwal requests asylum",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in December 2024, arguing he would face persecution if returned to Afghanistan, according to U.S. officials who requested anonymity to discuss internal government information.",
      "His application would have been another opportunity for the U.S. government to vet his case. USCIS generally requires asylum applicants to show up to in-person interviews at one of its offices across the country.",
      "A DHS official told CBS News the USCIS asylum vetting process generally involves the collection of biometrics, a review of social media activity, FBI background checks and other screenings. The process also includes an inquiry into whether the applicant can prove he or she would face persecution if deported because of one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a \"particular social group.\"",
      "In recent years, USCIS has been prioritizing Afghan asylum claims, processing them faster than the cases of other nationalities due to a Biden-era federal court settlement. The vast majority of Afghan asylum cases are approved. Government data shows 20,354 \u2014 96% \u2014 of 21,201 Afghan asylum requests decided by USCIS since the summer of 2021 were granted. Only 120 cases were denied during that time.",
      "Two U.S. officials and an ex-Afghan military official told CBS News that Lakanwal was part of a \"Zero Unit,\" one of a number of CIA-backed forces in the former Afghan government's military and intelligence apparatus that gained infamy for their secrecy and alleged brutality. That work could have made him a target for reprisals by the Taliban.",
      "April 2025: Lakanwal is granted asylum",
      "USCIS approved Lakanwal's asylum application in April 2025, granting him \u2014 and any derivative immediate relatives \u2014 asylee status, U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "While a grant of asylum is a determination that the applicant meets the legal definition of a refugee, it does not immediately bestow permanent legal status to the beneficiary. Asylees have to submit another application to request a green card, or lawful permanent resident status, which they can receive no sooner than one year after the grant of asylum. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that Lakanwal filed that application, known as an adjustment of status request, and that it was pending at the time of the attack.",
      "U.S. law allows the government to terminate someone's asylum status in certain circumstances, including when asylees commit serious crimes or fraud. A DHS official told CBS News that process requires USCIS to notify the asylee of the intent to terminate the status.",
      "Those whose asylum status is revoked are placed in deportation proceedings before federal immigration judges, who are overseen by the Justice Department. In Lakanwal's case, that process would likely not be finalized until after the adjudication of the criminal charges he faces because of last week's shooting.",

      "Citing a series of recent media reports, the committee Democrats allege Patel has used the FBI's Gulfstream passenger jet for a series of recent flights for a \"date night\" in Tennessee and an outing with friends in Texas.",
      "The panel's Democrats have asked Patel to respond with travel records, passenger information and any communication with passengers about the recent flights.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who is the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, and another committee member, Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California, wrote to the FBI to ask about Patel's Oct. 25 flight to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"You flew there because your girlfriend was performing at a wrestling match on the campus of Pennsylvania State University,\" the Democrats wrote in the letter. \"After attending her performance, you used the government's jet to fly with her home to Nashville the following day. Your 'date night' had no apparent connections to your official duties.\"",
      "The inquiry also questioned a trip to Texas that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "\"Later that weekend, you took the FBI jet to San Angelo, Texas, for four days, where Republican Party mega-donor Bubba Saulsbury hosted you at Boondoggle Ranch\u2014'a scenic hunting resort' that touts itself as the ideal place to 'waste money or time on unnecessary or questionable projects,'\" Raskin and Kamlager-Dove wrote.",

      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That allows them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel and to move quickly in the event of an emergency. They must reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",
      "CBS News reporting in May found Patel also appears to have made use of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets to travel to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, a country singer, lives.

    "summary": "Juan Orlando Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of Honduras.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday that he will be pardoning former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who in 2024 was convicted in New York for drug trafficking and weapons charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison.",
      "The president explained his decision on social media by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "The idea drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hern\u00e1ndez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"",
      "A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia, said of the pardon on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday claimed it was a \"clear Biden overprosecution,\" alleging that there was some \"egregious\" information that came out during Hern\u00e1ndez's trial.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump announced his intention to pardon the ex-president, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife Ana Garc\u00eda and their adult children gathered on the steps of their home in Tegucigalpa.",
      "Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump, saying that Mr. Trump had corrected an injustice, maintaining that Hern\u00e1ndez's prosecution was a coordinated plot by drug traffickers and the \"radical left\" to seek revenge against the former president.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on Friday was part of a broader message by the U.S. president backing Tito Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Mr. Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Mr. Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"",
      "Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.",
      "In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.",
      "Mr. Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, who the Trump administration has accused of leading a drug cartel, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships, including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.",
      "The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.",
      "Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba as acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba, who served as a personal lawyer to President Trump, as the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit was unanimous against the Trump administration, which has attempted to use a novel mechanism to place lawyers who have not received Senate approval into temporary U.S. attorney positions across the country.",
      "The case before the 3rd Circuit arose after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey challenged the validity of Habba's appointment as a violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and sought to have their indictments dismissed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled in August that Habba has been serving without lawful authority since the beginning of July, when she was tapped to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. Brann said she must be disqualified from participating in ongoing cases.",
      "The Justice Department appealed that decision to the 3rd Circuit, which is now the first federal appeals court to weigh in on the administration's scheme for installing certain U.S. attorneys.",
      "\"The court's decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,\" lawyers Abbe Lowell, Gerry Krovatin and Norm Eisen said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. attorneys wherever appropriate.\"",
      "Lowell argued before the 3rd Circuit, and Krovatin represents one of the defendants.",
      "Thomas Mirigliano, a lawyer who represented a second defendant, said \"the panel issued a clear and carefully reasoned decision that recognizes the extraordinary power vested in U.S. attorneys and reinforces the limits Congress has set on who may occupy those positions. We appreciate the Court's thoughtful approach and the clarity it brings to this important issue.\"",
      "Neither Habba nor the Justice Department immediately responded to requests for comment.",
      "Habba was tapped to serve as interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey earlier this year, but her appointment to the role was limited to 120 days, unless the U.S. district court in New Jersey voted to extend her tenure or she was confirmed to the post by the Senate. Habba's nomination, however, was unlikely to win approval in the upper chamber, as New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination.",
      "Ahead of the 120-day deadline, the judges in New Jersey declined to allow Habba to continue serving as U.S. attorney and instead voted to install her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position. But that decision was met with swift pushback from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who fired Grace.",
      "Then, Mr. Trump and top administration officials employed a multi-step maneuver to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and get around the district court's decision. First, the president withdrew Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Then, Habba resigned as interim U.S. attorney. Bondi then appointed Habba as \"special attorney\" and to fill Grace's role as first assistant U.S. attorney. Finally, because the position as the New Jersey's top prosecutor was vacant, Habba was elevated to the role of acting U.S. attorney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "That law, also known as the Vacancies Act, limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "In their decision, the judges on the 3rd Circuit found that the Trump administration's argument in support of Habba's role \"should raise a red flag,\" since it would allow the Justice Department to circumvent the Vacancies Act and effectively allow anyone to hold a U.S. attorney position indefinitely.",
      "\"Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U.S. Attorney indefinitely,\" Judge Michael Fisher wrote for the court. \"This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional [presidential appointment and Senate confirmation] process entirely. It also essentially eliminates the requirements of the FVRA and the U.S. Attorney-specific statute.\"",
      "Fisher was selected for the 3rd Circuit by President George W. Bush. He was joined in the decision by Judge L. Felipe Restrepo, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge D. Brooks Smith, tapped for the 3rd Circuit by Bush.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to install temporary U.S. attorneys in Nevada and Los Angeles using the mechanism it employed for Habba, but has faced resistance from the courts. The most high-profile of those decisions came last week, when a federal judge ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 08:56:34 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and more than a dozen of his allies were charged with offenses in Georgia relating to the 2020 presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Georgia judge on Wednesday agreed to dismiss the state's case against President Trump and his allies stemming from the 2020 presidential election after the local prosecutor who took over the case said he would no longer pursue the charges \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a brief order dismissing the case \"in its entirety\" shortly after Peter Skandalakis, who stepped in to replace Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after she was disqualified from the case, filed a motion informing the court of his decision to abandon the prosecution of Mr. Trump and more than a dozen others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.",
      "Skandalakis wrote in a memo accompanying the notice that overt acts listed in the indictment that were taken by the president and other Republicans \"are not acts I would consider sufficient\" to sustain a racketeering case. Skandalakis said that after reviewing the evidence, he concluded that a federal prosecution was more appropriate than one pursued by the state of Georgia, and said the \"strongest and most prosecutable case\" against those who allegedly sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election was the one being pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The president was charged with four federal counts stemming from an alleged effort to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, but Smith dropped the case after Mr. Trump won a second term in the White House.",
      "Steve Sadow, Mr. Trump's lawyer in the Georgia case, said in response to Skandalakis' motion, \"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the prosecution an \"illegal, unconstitutional and unAmerican hoax.\"",
      "\"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "A spokesperson for Giuliani cheered the decision.",
      "\"The decision to dismiss all criminal charges against Mayor Rudy Giuliani is long overdue and represents a complete repudiation of the demonstrably false claims that partisan actors used to justify his improper disbarment,\" Ted Goodman, Giuliani's spokesperson, said in a statement. \"The integrity of our justice system cannot be fully restored until Mayor Giuliani's law license is reinstated and the hundreds of other victims of the political weaponization against President Trump and his supporters receive the justice they deserve.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and 18 of his associates were indicted by a Fulton County grand jury in August 2023 under Georgia's racketeering law and were accused of coordinating a scheme to thwart certification of the 2020 election results in the state. The indictment capped an extraordinary and historic five months, across which the president was charged in four separate cases involving allegations of conduct that bookended his first term in office. Mr. Trump was the first former president to be charged with a crime.",
      "Two of those cases were brought by Smith and involved federal offenses, and a third was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney and stemmed from an alleged \"hush money\" payment to an adult film actress before the 2016 election. Smith ended his prosecutions of the president \u2014 one related to the 2020 election and the other involving his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after leaving office in January 2021 \u2014 after he won a second term.",
      "In the New York case, Mr. Trump was found guilty of 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in June 2024 and has appealed the conviction.",
      "Mr. Trump was initially charged with 13 felony counts in Georgia, but several have been dismissed in the years since the indictment. He pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. Four of the president's 18 co-defendants accepted plea deals from prosecutors.",
      "The prosecution in Fulton County moved the slowest of the criminal cases involving the president, and proceedings were derailed for months by the bombshell revelation that Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor to assist in the investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies.",
      "The two acknowledged the relationship but said it didn't begin until months after Wade was hired in November 2021.",
      "The trial court judge overseeing the case, Scott McAfee, held a multi-day hearing to examine whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because of her relationship with Wade and travels with him, during which both prosecutors testified.",
      "McAfee ultimately declined to disqualify Willis from the case but said Wade had to step aside, which he did. But Mr. Trump and a group of his co-defendants appealed the ruling.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed McAfee's decision in December and said disqualification of Willis was the only remedy to restore public confidence in the integrity of the proceedings. The Georgia Supreme Court turned away Willis' appeal\u00a0in September, leaving the ruling mandating her removal from the case against Mr. Trump intact.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, which of Skandalakis is the executive director, was tasked with finding a replacement to take over the case from Willis. He announced earlier this month that he would helm the prosecution himself after several others contacted declined to do so.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said a reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday that a reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
      "\"If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Washington Post reported Friday that in the U.S.' first strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors. A follow-on strike was ordered to comply with the instructions, killing two survivors in the water, the Post reported. Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "Targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are wounded is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, which also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\" A group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. And the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees pledged to investigate the reported follow-on strike.",
      "Asked about the reported follow-on strike while aboard Air Force One on Sunday, President Trump said, \"First of all, I don't know that that happened, and Pete [Hegseth] said he didn't even know what people were talking about.\"",
      "\"So, we'll look into it. But no, I wouldn't have wanted that, a second strike,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. If there were two people around \u2014 but Pete [Hegseth] said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him ... I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he didn't order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean. Kaine outlined to CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that lawmakers have been seeking answers to a number of questions about the strikes, including seeking evidence that \"the folks on board were really narco traffickers,\" the question of why to strike rather than interdict, and the legal rationale for the strikes.",
      "\"We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration, the supposed legal rationale for the strikes at international waters,\" Kaine said. \"It was very shoddy.\"",
      "The Virginia Democrat said, \"It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say-so, which is not what the Constitution allowed.\"",
      "Kaine has twice tried to pass war powers resolutions aimed at preventing the president from conducting strikes against Venezuela, earning support from two Republicans.",
      "\"That was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed,\" Kaine said.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\" The post comes as the administration has increased pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, with signs that military action, including possible ground action, could be imminent.",
      "Kaine said if there's ground action, the numbers in the Senate would change. And he noted that he would move \"immediately\" on a war powers resolution \"should there be military action.\"",
      "\"The circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote,\" Kaine said. \"We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations \u2014 so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth \u2014 we do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee and previously led the House Intelligence Committee, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. He said \"Congress does not have information\" that the reported follow-on strike occurred.",
      "\"If that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,\" Turner added.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio expressed concern Sunday that the White House-backed proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine is too pro-Russia, while urging that any peace arrangement must look at Russia as a \"skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Turner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the president's \"goal of peace is incredibly important,\" while acknowledging comments made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's supporting a sovereign Ukraine as negotiators gathered in Miami on Sunday morning.",
      "The team of Ukrainian negotiators began meeting Sunday morning with Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law. Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow later this week.",
      "As the meeting kicked off Sunday, Rubio outlined that \"the end goal is obviously not just the end of the war,\" but also \"securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\"",
      "Rubio's comments come after the White House floated a peace proposal earlier this month that critics said favored Russia, initially including several provisions that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had rejected in the past. But the plan has since been revised, Mr. Trump has outlined, citing progress on both sides.",
      "Asked by CBS' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America First and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "\"It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States, it's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber, it continuously identifies both NATO and the west, the United States, as its adversary,\" Turner said. \"You have to understand that the balance of this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.\"",
      "Asked about a transcript of a call published by Bloomberg in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching a Kremlin aide on how to negotiate with President Trump, Turner said \"the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.\"",
      "Turner said \"this is not a military against military action, they are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin,\" Turner added.",
      "As for Witkoff, Turner said \"I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during the long, stretched out aspects of negotiations as reflective. But I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.\"",
      "\"The orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy's is very concerning,\" Turner said. \"Because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.\"",
      "On Sunday afternoon, Rubio called the day's meeting \"another very productive session,\" reiterating the intention to end the war while also working to \"help Ukraine be safe forever.\" He called it a \"shared vision.\"",
      "\"But there's more work to be done,\" Rubio said after the meeting. \"This is delicate, it's complicated, there are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there's another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week when Mr. Witkoff travels to Moscow.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members. One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America, and we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina this morning. Claire, thanks so much for being with us, and happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely. So during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again, but even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah. So I'm so glad that you- you made that point. I- I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic, as an example. We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system, they're people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs so this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country,",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits, but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now, there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work, because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big missing rungs, if you will, so we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well. We as a nation should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things, it will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: \u00a0Yeah, unfortunately, the lines are longer than- than the food that is available, and one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves, as I have for mine and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family ofttimes to be able to do that, and then for them to turn up in spite of all of those barriers, and not- us not be able to provide them with what they really need so I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I've been a person who's experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do, so many of them are my heroes. And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network, who show up shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their well being. So we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment, until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So the kinds of things that we ought to do: we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates, but we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around, that we can hold hands shoulder to shoulder, because when people experiencing hunger win, we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Kevin, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So we've all eaten the turkey. Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods, in part, are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen- those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend, but we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday and the online sales were up almost 10%, in store sales were up 4%, it was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving. And so I think that the folks who are saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about going back and getting presents for the kids and so on. They've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people- incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report and with strong income and the government shut down over so that people presumably have a little pent up demand as well. I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up. Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka Trucks said a couple days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China. What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like egg prices are down. Gasoline prices drop below $2 a gallon in a lot of places, mortgage rates are down--",
      "NANCY CORDES: --you mean below- gas prices on average are still at $3 a gallon.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah that's right for a few states they got below two. And so the point is just that- in the end, what matters is in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys, and that averaged about 5% under Joe Biden, and is a little bit above two and a half percent- about cut in half for President Trump. And the bottom line, though, is really the wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we could have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though you're right, there are some things that cost more, some things that cost less, but on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68% of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4% year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office. How do you explain that?",
      "HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned quite accurately, the 1.4% increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4% is very, very low inflation. And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill' cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on, and all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets, and that's why they're optimistic about next year. Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at first half of next year that could be in the 4% range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July, and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well. And so we're really optimistic, and we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week, a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years, then you dropped the proposal, and then the President said on Air Force One, somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all. Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened as, you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care, and that's why we had $50 billion for rural hospitals in the 'Big, Beautiful, Bill,' why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing. And the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach. And so I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work- work this out, because we have a solution. The White House has a solution for cost- cost sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those. But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month, and so- so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have, it's really just the very, very high cost people who are closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Bloomberg is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the front runner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that Bloomberg has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressive about this week when that story leaked was that really, I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who is going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down. And so I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision. So for now, Director of the White House, National Economic Council, that's your title today. Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 30, 2025.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela, because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice, you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action, and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SEN. KAINE: I d- I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed, but that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela, and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action. And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific together with Adam Schiff, and the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth. We do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new Washington Post report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard, the first suspected drug boat that was targeted, to be killed when two people survived. The military went back in, reportedly with a follow-on strike. What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narcotraffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Colombian, one Ecuadoran in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin where they were released. So if they were narcotraffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict. If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher-ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures. And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about is the entire legal rationale for the strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar after weeks and weeks out of the administration. The supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters, it was very shoddy. Because it's classified, I can't tell you what's in it. But I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said the strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies like the U.K. to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to rein in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: A lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising. On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan OrlandoHern\u00e1ndez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. He's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the President's plan to pardon him, given how strongly the President feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?\u00a0SEN. KAINE: This is shocking, and again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narcotrafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about? The President of Colombia has said that he thinks it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for a year as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this- this military effort is so important to the President when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The President says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls \"third world countries,\" we don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact, these two guards, members, Ms. Beckstrom andMr. Wolfe, what a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving, celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment, to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do. And this demonstrates, yet again, something we've seen so often our troops, including our guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways, and we can be so proud of them, but the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all, or an order to send guardsmen and women in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, and I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result. The President's decision to say, okay, this particular criminal who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant, that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19 quote \"third world countries\" you don't know which ones they are. You shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law. But don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third world countries are bad. Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant, and our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target- target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of Congress- of conversation rather, in Congress--SEN. KAINE: --It will--NANCY CORDES: --this week. Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us, and Happy Thanksgiving.SEN. KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.\u00a0NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",

      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it. Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REP. TURNER: This is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who doesn't enact a murderous act right before Thanksgiving and the- I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here. We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al-Qaeda, to avenge 9//11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism. What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision--",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, they were- their intention was that they would be still there. That Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be a return to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated. You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia, they were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us. And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process. So obviously that the vetting process\u2013",
      "NANCY CORDES:-- But then- then they were identified--",
      "REP. TURNER:-- but they made it in. They made it in, right? They made it into this country. So obviously the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan. In which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits. And they not only ran for the exits, they did so at night. You know, Congress was, you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with this consequence now, the investigation is underway.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so, and Congress did a number of investigations, at a number of hearings, and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, a manner in which they completely withdrew. But that investigation is underway. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The President has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150. Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REP. TURNER: When you ask this, is that the answer? You have to first talk about what the question is, and the question is, is there a national issue of- of crime and safety? And certainly the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And certainly in the nation's capital, there has been- there has been unbelievable reports of just the- the criminal activity, though, the- those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right. No question, I think crime is down 30% something like that in DC in the last four months. I want to turn to Ukraine now, another issue very important to you. A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now. There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think we all have those concerns. The- the- you know, the President's goal of peace is incredibly important, and we saw today with Secretary Rubio his statement of, you know, we have to have a strong and sovereign Ukraine, and I- and that's everyone's goal, and the- and certainly a prosperous Ukraine. And we saw the Ukrainian representative there, who is, you know, committed. And we certainly think, and I think everyone thinks that President Zelenskyy is committed to peace. But you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have- you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has- is a self declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new, advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States. It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So in this and of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary. You have to understand that the balance of this- this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Speaking of the question of being pro-Russian, this week, Bloomberg got a hold of this transcript of a call between Steve Witkoff, the special envoy, and a Putin advisor, in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching the Russian on how to win over President Trump. And there are several Republicans that have great concerns about that. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania called it a major problem. Don Bacon of Nebraska said Witkoff fully favors the Russians and should be fired. What do you think?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelensky was on his way to the White House. And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that, especially as you have, you know- in this instance Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people. It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this it's killing civilians. It is- it is not just this. Is not a military against military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine. The- the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main US negotiators here and should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern. And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent. And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: President Trump said this was just regular deal making. I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the President said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed. Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, the President did not say that, and the President certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur. And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the President has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean, and with respect to the drug trade that the President has been discussing with Congress, it is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The Washington Post is reporting that before the strike on the very first suspected drug vote in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water. Now some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REP. TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations. Obviously, if that occurred, that would be- be very serious, and I agree that- that- that would- would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in- in this. There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is- is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out. Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",
      "REP. TURNER: I appreciate it.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "NANCY CORDES: I'm Nancy Cordes in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump escalates his anti- immigration crackdown after the deadly shooting of National Guard troops in D.C. And, as the president's team pushes for peace in Ukraine, the pressure campaign on Venezuela intensifies.",
      "The horrific shooting in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national, left one National Guard member dead and another fighting for his life, angering President Trump, who accused the Biden administration of allowing thousands of Afghans into the country without proper vetting.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Your DOJ I.G. just reported this year that there was thorough vetting by DHS and by the FBI of these Afghans who were brought into the U.S., so why do you blame the Biden administration for what this man did?",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Because they let him in. Are you stupid?",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, no.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Are you a stupid person? Because they came in to - - on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Investigators have yet to find a clear motive behind the shooting, but President Trump isn't waiting. He's halting immigration from Afghanistan and elsewhere. We will bring you the latest on the shooting and the policy response.",
      "Plus: Russia launches a massive drone and missile strike on Kyiv, defying the U.S. push for peace in Ukraine.",
      "And the president warns commercial planes to clear the airspace over Venezuela. Is that a sign of an imminent attack by the U.S.?",
      "We will get the latest on both fronts from Republican Congressman Mike Turner and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.",
      "And we will check in with President Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, on the biggest shopping weekend of the year and get a reality check on the worsening hunger crisis with Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is off today.",
      "As Thanksgiving weekend draws to a close, for some, the holiday shopping spree is officially under way, while others are braving the crowds at airports and on highways to get home.",
      "Here in Washington, a simmering debate over immigration and national security has boiled over following the shooting of two National Guard members.",
      "Our homeland security and justice correspondent, Nicole Sganga, is here with the latest.",
      "You have been out front on this story, Nicole. What's the latest?",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: The targeted attack just blocks away from the White House killed 20-year-old Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. This morning, Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition, fighting for his life.",
      "Moments ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Rahmanullah Lakanwal may have been radicalized on American soil, but argued the attack was the consequence of failed vetting.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NICOLE SGANGA (voice-over): The investigation is under way. Intelligence analysts are now tasked with combing through the suspect's devices and online presence for signs of radicalization.",
      "So far, sources tell CBS News there have been no confirmed extremist ties. Rahmanullah Lakanwal served for eight years on a CIA-backed Zero Unit team, an Afghan paramilitary outfit notorious for intense combat and high-risk raids.",
      "U.S. and Afghan officials tell CBS News the suspect had been deeply disturbed by casualties in his unit and more recently troubled by the killing of his close friend by armed men in Pakistan. Lakanwal first entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome following the fall of Kabul.",
      "The 29-year-old was granted asylum in the U.S. this April. Now he faces first-degree murder charges. A 2025 Justice Department audit found only 55 evacuees arriving to the U.S. under the program were flagged by terrorism- screening databases. Last year, just nine remained on the watch list.",
      "This weekend, D.C. police accompanied National Guard on their street patrols. Governor Patrick Morrisey oversees West Virginia's National Guard.",
      "What do you say to Americans who are watching this play out and, in the wake of this tragedy, they might feel like Guardsmen now have a target on their back?",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY (R-West Virginia): I think people who question the mission should look at what's happened in Washington, D.C., and you had a city that had a lot of problems with crime, and there have been clear and meaningful reductions. I think that matters a lot.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: President Trump has ordered 500 more National Guard members to D.C., bringing the total to nearly 3,000 troops.",
      "And, on Friday, the U.S. directed immigration officers to pause all asylum decisions, leaving over two million applicants in limbo, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Nicole Sganga, thank you so much for staying on top of this.",
      "And for more on the vetting of the suspect before he entered the country, we are joined now by Samantha Vinograd, who is a former top counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security under President Biden and was deeply involved in the process for screening and vetting. She is now a national security contributor here at CBS News.",
      "Sam, so good to have you with us.",
      "Just this morning, the attorney general said that this suspect entered the U.S. with minimal to little vetting. Is that accurate?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, Nancy, I'm happy to talk about the vetting.",
      "But, at this point, we don't have indications that the horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure. Instead, the attorney general also said this morning it appears the individual was radicalized once here. And let's be clear on what the vetting system is and what it isn't.",
      "The vetting system is a system in which an individual's identifiers, their biographic information and biometric information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images, are run against datasets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history.",
      "The vetting system is not predictive of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not at some point going to become violent. What I can tell you is this. And I was involved in the process. Every Afghan evacuee underwent vetting overseas before they were cleared to be manifested for a flight to the United States.",
      "They underwent vetting once they were manifested for a flight at a port of entry before entering the United States. And then Afghan evacuees, including the suspect, were vetted again once in the U.S. by the Biden administration.",
      "And this suspect underwent the most comprehensive vetting under the current administration when he applied for asylum. That process would typically involve an interview and a review of social media handles.",
      "NANCY CORDES: OK, I hear what you're saying, but I want to read to you something that a DOJ inspector general report laid out earlier this year.",
      "They said that, when tens of thousands of Afghans arrived at once here in the U.S. at the end of the war \u2013 quote \u2013 \"The normal processes required to determine whether individuals posed a threat to national security and public safety were overtaken by the need to immediately evacuate and protect the lives of Afghans, increasing the potential that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation.\"",
      "Were there vetting corners that had to be cut here?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, during the Afghanistan withdrawal in the subsequent period, there were various priorities in place, certainly. We wanted to help our Afghan partners and bring at-risk Afghans here.",
      "But protecting national security and public safety was the foremost priority. And that's why a process was designed that vetted individuals overseas, but it was never intended to be a one-and-done. It was a multistage process with various U.S. government agencies.",
      "Afghan evacuees were vetted overseas by graphic and biometric vetting. And then there were other stages of vetting that occurred once individuals were here. So we have to put this vetting process in context.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Let's talk about this suspect specifically.",
      "What can you tell us about these so-called Zero Units that the suspect was a part of in Afghanistan? He worked with the CIA for years, right?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: He did, which means that he was vetted by the CIA prior to beginning work in the Zero Unit, which was a paramilitary and intelligence force that partnered with the CIA incredibly closely on some very intense missions.",
      "So this suspect reportedly underwent vetting by the CIA for the first time over a decade ago. He had highly specialized training. He did undergo vetting at the time that he started working with the CIA and went on some very complex missions. These units were accused of certain human rights abuses.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And, as you pointed out, the attorney general did say this morning that it's believed that the shooter was radicalized here in the United States.",
      "The AP is now reporting that his behavior deteriorated so sharply in recent months that a community advocate was afraid that he was suicidal. Where does this investigation go from here?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, this horrific tragedy could be the result of an individual that quickly mobilized to violence without any ties to foreign terrorism. And as we have discussed in other cases, trying to find lone actors before they initiate an attack is harder than trying to find a needle in a haystack.",
      "That work, trying to find a lone actor who's mobilizing to violence quickly, involves intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism officials here in the U.S., not vetting experts, but here in the U.S. at all levels of government, federal, state, and local, to try to find size \u2013 signs that an individual is mobilizing to violence and try to get them help before they actually initiate an attack.",
      "NANCY CORDES: When the president says that he wants to have everyone who came in here to the United States from Afghanistan, about 90,000 people, rescreened, reexamined, how would that work? And does DHS have the resources to do that?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, to be very clear, DHS is not the only entity involved in vetting. Various members of the counterterrorism, law enforcement, and intelligence community perform vetting.",
      "I do have questions about the number of resources available to engage in that exercise, just based upon resource constraints within the federal government. But it is possible. It will take time. But, to be clear, Afghan evacuees have been re-vetted since coming to the United States. They were re-vetted under the Biden administration.",
      "And then, as they have adjusted their status to asylum or other things, they had to go through already other vetting processes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You know, you talk about this suspect and trying to find signs that he was radicalized. How will investigators go about doing that?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, investigators are certainly already speaking to individuals that knew the suspect, friends, family, co-workers, the organizations that helped support him in the community.",
      "And we don't yet know, Nancy, whether this individual was known to law enforcement in his community. I think we will learn that in the coming days.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Great insight.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thanks, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sam Vinograd, CBS News contributor, thank you so much.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Congressman, thanks for being with us. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Thank you, Nancy. Happy Thanksgiving to you also.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, you heard what Sam Vinograd just had to say about the vetting process. You've also heard what administration officials are saying about it.",
      "Do you believe that this was a failure of vetting, or do you believe this is someone who just became radicalized or became mentally disturbed here in the United States?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Nancy, this is very difficult, because, I mean, this is classic terrorism. And this is where an individual who tries to break the heart of a nation who does an act, a murderous act, right before Thanksgiving, and the \u2013 I think what Samantha is missing in all of this is that we didn't go to Afghanistan to bring Afghanis here.",
      "We went to Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, to dismantle and destroy al Qaeda, to avenge 9/11, to dismantle and to overthrow the Taliban, and to ensure that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for terrorism.",
      "What occurred is that the Biden administration allowed Afghanistan to fall and fled, and, in doing so, then found itself in a situation where those who had been aiding us were then at risk, and in doing so made the decision\u2026",
      "NANCY CORDES: You don't think they would have been at risk either way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, they were \u2013 their intention was that they would be still there, that Afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists, that it would not be returned to the Taliban, and there would not be a need for those people to be evacuated.",
      "You wouldn't see American planes on the tarmac, as you showed, with people running to try to get on them. By the way, those planes wouldn't be being chased by people if they were on their way to China or Russia. They were on their way to America, and those people were fleeing what the Biden administration was allowing to unfold, which is that it would once again be a nation that would be at risk to us.",
      "And so, you know, that's how you get to the situation where those individuals are at risk. Now, obviously, the vetting was flawed. By your own report, you showed that individuals who were on our known terrorist watch list made it into this country through that process, so, obviously, that the vetting process\u2026",
      "NANCY CORDES: But then they were \u2013 then they were identified\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But they made it in. They made it in, right?",
      "NANCY CORDES: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: They made it into this country. So, obviously, the process was flawed, and it was also a process that should have been unnecessary, if there hadn't been this hasty fall of Afghanistan, which the Biden administration had promised us all that they were not going to run for the exits.",
      "And they not only ran for the exits. They did so at night. You know, Congress was \u2013 you know, after hearing, after hearing, you know, raised the issues of the manner in which the Biden administration fled and what the consequences would be. And we're all living with those consequences. Now, the investigation is under way.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Weren't their hands tied in part by the fact that Trump had cut a deal with the Taliban promising to leave by a certain date?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, their hands were not tied. The manner in which they did so \u2013 and Congress did a number of investigations and a number of hearings and filed a number of reports that showed that it was the actions of the Biden administration, the manner in which they completely withdrew.",
      "But that investigation is under way. It's going to be underway as to this individual, and I think we all need to wait for that investigation to be concluded.",
      "NANCY CORDES: The president has called for 500 more National Guard troops to be sent to the nation's capital. Your state has already contributed 150.",
      "Do you believe that more troops being deployed is the answer, or do you think it's time to wind this deployment down?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, when you ask, is that the answer, you have to first talk about what the question is.",
      "And the question is, is there a national issue of \u2013 of crime and safety? And, certainly, the American people, by all polls, indicate that people are experiencing it and report that there is. And, certainly, in the nation's capital, there has been.",
      "There has been unbelievable reports of just the \u2013 the criminal activity, those \u2013 the \u2013 those individuals who have succumbed to, you know, violent crime. And, certainly, there's been a reporting that the National Guard presence has made a difference.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Right, no question, I think crime is down 30 percent, something like that, in D.C. in the last four months.",
      "I want to turn to Ukraine now\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \u2026 another issue very important to you.",
      "A team of Ukrainian negotiators is meeting right now in Miami with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. What's your understanding of where the negotiations stand right now? There were concerns initially that the White House plan was too pro-Russia. Do you still have those concerns?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think we all have those concerns.",
      "The \u2013 the \u2013 you know, the president's goal of peace is incredibly important, and we saw today with Secretary Rubio his statement of, you know, we have to have a strong and sovereign Ukraine.",
      "And I \u2013 and that's everyone's goal and the \u2013 and certainly a prosperous Ukraine. And we saw the Ukrainian representative there, who is, you know, committed. And we certainly think and I think everyone thinks that President Zelenskyy is committed to peace.",
      "But, you know, one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have \u2013 you can't be America first and pro-Russia, because Russia has \u2013 is a self-declared adversary of the United States. It's fielding new advanced nuclear weapons that are specifically targeting the United States.",
      "It's constantly attacking the United States with offensive cyber. It continuously identifies both NATO and the West, the United States as its adversary. So, in this \u2013 and, of course, when it identifies Ukraine as its adversary, it does so in identifying the West and the United States as its adversary.",
      "You have to understand that the balance of this \u2013 this peace arrangement has to be one where you have to look at Russia as a skeptical adversary.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Speaking of the question of being pro-Russian, this week, Bloomberg got a hold of this transcript of a call between Steve Witkoff, the special envoy, and a Putin adviser, in which Witkoff appeared to be coaching the Russian on how to win over President Trump.",
      "And there are several Republicans that have great concerns about that. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania called it a major problem. Don Bacon of Nebraska said Witkoff fully favors the Russians and should be fired.",
      "What do you think?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the part that concerned me most is that there appeared to be an orchestration of giving Putin an opportunity to speak to Trump before President Zelenskyy was on his way to the White House.",
      "And I wouldn't want any orchestration of lessening President Zelenskyy's relationship with Trump, because it's very important when you have negotiations that \u2013 especially as you have, you know, in this instance, Russia is being, you know, obviously, unbelievably murderous of the Ukrainian people.",
      "It is an aggressive authoritarian regime in this. It's killing civilians. It is \u2013 it is not just \u2013 this is not a military-against-military action. They are bombing into Ukraine and murderously killing civilians in Ukraine.",
      "The \u2013 the Ukrainian people are being subjected to this, and the \u2013 President Trump needs to be able to hear Zelenskyy's voice clearly, and not just the authoritarian, murderous Putin.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, given your concerns, should Witkoff continue to serve as one of the main U.S. negotiators here, and he \u2013 should he be sent by President Trump to Moscow this week to meet with Putin?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I \u2013 I think you can't take just one slice of someone's conversation during a long, stretched-out aspect of negotiations as reflective, but I think it's certainly important that, when we do get that opportunity, that our voices are heard of caution and concern.",
      "And the orchestration of inserting Putin's voice before Zelenskyy is very concerning, and I think the White House should be very concerned about any efforts to orchestrate Putin's voice at the White House before Zelenskyy's, because Ukraine's sovereignty and security needs to be preeminent.",
      "And we heard that this morning from Rubio, and that needs to be the focus.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And President Trump said this was just regular dealmaking.",
      "I want to turn to Venezuela, because you're on the House Armed Services Committee. We've all been watching the military buildup in the waters around Venezuela. Just yesterday, the president said airlines should consider Venezuelan airspace closed.",
      "Do you take that to mean that a military operation is imminent?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the president did not say that, and the president certainly has not given Congress any notice that that is going to occur.",
      "And he certainly has not made the case. There is a buildup that the president has not explained in a way that relates solely to the actions that are currently going down in the Caribbean and with respect to the drug trade that the president has been discussing with Congress. It is certainly a significant concern in Congress.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that, before the strike on the very first suspected drug boat in September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered that everyone on board be killed, and then, when two of the 11 people on board survived, a follow-on strike was ordered to finish them off in the water.",
      "Now, some law of war experts are saying that that was illegal, that killing people who are no longer able to fight is a war crime. What is your view and what questions do you have for the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Congress does not have information that that had occurred. Both the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking members have opened investigations.",
      "Obviously, if that occurred, that would be \u2013 be very serious, and I agree that that would \u2013 would be an illegal act. That is not the legal opinion or the information or the legal justification, the acts that have been described to Congress that are being undertaken in \u2013 in this.",
      "There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so- called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification has been provided. But this is \u2013 is completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Very interesting to hear you say that this might be an illegal act. I know your committee is asking more questions. We'd love to learn what you find out.",
      "Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio, thank you so much for being with us.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Some sad news out of California overnight. Four people were killed and 10 others hurt when a gunman opened fire during a family celebration at a banquet hall in Stockton, California. The local sheriff's office says early indications suggest the shooting was targeted.",
      "A suspect has not been identified and is still at large. Police are urging anyone with any information that may be helpful to come forward.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We will be right back with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, and Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We're joined by Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.",
      "Senator, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Absolutely, Nancy.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to start out by asking you about the situation in Venezuela because there are now serious signs that military action, including potentially ground action, could be imminent. You have tried twice to pass war powers resolutions that would force President Trump to get approval from Congress first before any military action. Twice you have failed. Do you think the numbers on this will change if there is ground action and will it even matter at that point?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I do \u2013 I do believe the numbers will change. You're right, I, along with others, filed a resolution, no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. It failed. But that was before all of these assets have amassed around Venezuela and before President Trump said that the airspace needs to be closed. I will move with colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Paul, Senator Schiff, immediately should there be military action.",
      "And then secondly, I also attempted to stop the, what I view as illegal boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific, together with Adam Schiff. And the circumstances have changed in the months since we had that vote. In each of these instances, we were able to get two Republicans to vote together with Democrats. We think the escalating pace and some of the recent revelations, so, for example, the recent revelation about the kill everyone order apparently dictated by Secretary Hegseth, we do believe that we will get more support for these motions when they are refiled.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You're referring to this new \"Washington Post\" report that says that Secretary Hegseth called for everyone aboard the first suspected drug boat that was targeted to be killed. When two people survived, the military went back in, reportedly, with a follow-on strike.",
      "What questions do you have for the Pentagon about that situation?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, first, if that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true. And the questions that we've been asking for months are, give us the evidence that the folks on board were really narco traffickers. In one instance, there were two survivors, one Columbian, one Ecuadorian in a different strike. Instead of arresting them and prosecuting them, the U.S. picked them up and returned them to their countries of origin, where they were released. So, if they were narco traffickers, why would we do that? We need more evidence about that. And we definitely need the administration to finally answer the question of why strike rather than interdict? If you know where the ships are, you can interdict. And when you do, you get evidence. You get individuals. You can squeeze them to give testimony against their higher ups. You get evidence with the drug seizures.",
      "And finally, the other question that my colleagues and I are deeply worried about, is the entire legal rationale for these strikes. We had to pry with a crowbar, after weeks and weeks, out of the administration the supposed legal rationale for the strikes in international waters. It was very shoddy because it's classified. I can't tell you what's in it, but I can tell you it was not at all persuasive that these are legal actions. And so together with a whole series of things, the early retirement of the head of SOUTHCOM, the news that the SOUTHCOM's lead attorney said these strikes were not lawful, the decision of allies, like the U.K., to stop sharing intelligence with the United States in this area because they believe the strikes are illegal. It's time for Congress to reign in a president who is deciding to wage war on his own say so, which is not what the Constitution allows.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Yes, a lot of lawmakers on both sides have questions that are similar to the ones you're raising.",
      "On a related note, President Trump just announced this weekend that he plans to pardon former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was accused of conspiring with drug cartels to move 400 tons of cocaine from Honduras to the U.S. he's currently serving a 45-year sentence. Were you surprised by the president's plan to pardon him given how strongly the president feels about drugs coming from other countries like Venezuela?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: This is shocking. And again, this is not an individual who was accused of running drugs to the United States. He was convicted in a federal court in the United States. One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine. More than 400 tons.",
      "He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts. And less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco trafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House. And if he doesn't care about narco trafficking, and this was also shown earlier this year with the pardoning of Ross Ulbricht, then what is this Venezuela thing really about?",
      "The president of Columbia has said that he think it's about the U.S. trying to seize oil assets in Venezuela. I lived in Honduras for years as a missionary way back when. The conspiracy theories are running wild in the Americas about why this military effort is so important to the president when he's pardoning drug kingpins who are running drugs into the United States. These are also questions that we're going to have to dig deeply into when we return to Washington tomorrow.",
      "NANCY CORDES: I want to ask you about some big developments in Washington this week. The Trump administration is making big changes in the wake of this tragic shooting of two National Guard members. They are halting all asylum decisions. They are halting Afghan immigration applications. The president says he wants a permanent pause to immigration from what he calls third world countries. We don't know how many countries. Do they have a case that it makes sense to put some of these processes on hold while they figure out what happened here?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, you know, first, let's just acknowledge this sad fact. These two Guards members, Ms. Beckstrom and Mr. Wolfe. What a tragedy for them and their families. And you know what? They should have been at home at Thanksgiving celebrating Thanksgiving with their families, not deployed in a political deployment to do law enforcement in D.C. that the D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies can do.",
      "And this demonstrates yet again something we've seen so often. Our troops, including our Guards members, they're going to serve in brave and courageous and self-sacrificing ways. And we can about so proud of them.",
      "But the orders that they get from their civilian leaders, that's where the problem comes in. Whether it's a Hegseth order to kill them all or an order to send Guards men and women, in a political stunt deployment to cities around the country, these two individuals should have been celebrating Thanksgiving with their families. And I just mourn for them and all who suffer as a result.",
      "The president's decision to say, OK, this particular criminal, who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, who came in under an asylum grant that President Trump and his administration decided this past summer, that now we're going to pause processes or asylum from 19, quote, \"third world countries,\" we don't know which ones they are, you shouldn't paint with a broad brush. Go after a criminal to the full extent of the law, but don't say that all Afghans in the United States, those who served with our military and who lost their lives and their health and their families in many ways by doing so, don't say that they're all bad. Don't say that people who come from third-world countries are bad.",
      "Virginia, about one out of nine of us is an immigrant. And our immigrant communities in Virginia have been an enormous source of strength to our commonwealth and to our country. And it's wrong to target them all for the bad actions of an individual, just like we wouldn't target other communities in the United States for the bad actions of one individual.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Something tells me this is going to be a big topic of conversation in Congress this week.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: It will.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Senator Kaine, I really appreciate you being with us and Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: So glad we could do it. Thanks.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett.",
      "Kevin, thanks so much for being with us.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT (Director, White House National Economic Council): Great to be here.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, we've all eaten the turkey.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Holiday shopping has begun in earnest. So, let's talk about what the holiday shopping season looks like. We've got new surveys from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that paint a modest picture of the holiday spending outlook. They say low and middle income Americans are planning to pull back a little bit because they perceive that prices are higher. And they say, if spending is up this year, it's going to be because goods in part are more expensive. Is this the temporary result or long-term result of the Trump tariffs?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, what we've seen \u2013 those were reports about what people anticipated would happen over the Thanksgiving weekend. But we now have hard data for Black Friday and even for Saturday. And the online sales were up almost 10 percent, in-store sales were up four percent. It was really a blockbuster weekend after Thanksgiving.",
      "And so I think that the folks who were saying, wow, maybe people are going to be anxious about, you know, going back and getting presents for the kids and so on, they've been disproven this weekend. And I think the reason is that people \u2013 incomes are up this year. We had a great jobs report. And with strong income and the government shutdown over so that people presumably have a little pent-up demand as well, I think that we're looking at a great recovery from a weak few weeks because of the shutdown.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Sure. I'm wondering how much of that spending increase you think is attributable to the fact that prices are up? Let me give you an example. The maker of Tonka trucks said a couple of days ago that a toy truck that cost $30 last year is going to cost $40 this year, partly because they lost about eight weeks of shipping due to the U.S. trade war with China.",
      "What's your advice to holiday shoppers who don't want to spend more this year than they did last year, or can't afford to spend more?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, as you know, it depends on what you're looking at. Like, egg prices are down. Gasoline prices dropped below $2 a gallon in a lot of places. Mortgage rates are down.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mean below \u2013",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, mortgage rates are down.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Gas prices, on average, are still at $3 a gallon across the country, right?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, that's right. For a few states, they got \u2013 they got below $2. And so the point is just that, in the end, what matters is, in the aggregate, the average across everything that everybody buys. And that averaged about 5 percent under Joe Biden and is a little bit above 2.5 percent, about cut in half for President Trump.",
      "And the bottom line, though, is really that wages have been growing faster than prices, and that's why real incomes this year are up by about $1,200 so far. That's why we can have a great Black Friday and a great Thanksgiving sales weekend because people feel like they have more money in their pockets. Even though, you're right, there are some things that cost most and some things that cost less. But on average, we're about half the inflation rate of Joe Biden.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Polls show that the public, despite some of the data you're presenting, is getting more skeptical. In our latest CBS News poll, 68 percent of Americans said they believe that President Trump's policies are pushing grocery prices up. They're up about 1.4 percent year to date. And economic sentiment, the number of people who think the economy is good, has actually dropped six points since he took office.",
      "How do you explain that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, you mentioned, quite accurately, the 1.4 percent increase in grocery prices. I think the interesting thing about that is that that's way below the Fed's target of two for everything else, right? And so you'd have to concede that 1.4 percent is very, very low inflation.",
      "And so I think that the bottom line is that we've got the big, beautiful bill cutting taxes on overtime, taxes for tips and so on. And all that money is going to start to be in people's pockets. And that's why they're optimistic about next year.",
      "Scott Bessent said last week that he's looking at the first half of next year that could be in the four percent range. And the reason is that we passed the tax cuts in July and so they didn't have time to change all the tax forms and everything. And so people are going to get really, really big refunds in the fall as well.",
      "And so we're really optimistic. And we think that the good news around Thanksgiving is a sign of something that's even stronger to come.",
      "NANCY CORDES: You mentioned purchasing power. One thing that is going to affect purchasing power for 22 million Americans is the expiration of Obamacare premium subsidies. Last week a funny situation. The White House floated this plan to extend the subsidies for two years. Then you dropped the proposal. And then the president said, on Air Force One, \"somebody said I wanted to extend it for two years. I don't want to extend it for two years. I'd rather not extend them at all.\"",
      "Was this a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, I think that people were talking to each other. But what happened, as you know, as a professional journalist, is that sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional. And I think that somebody did that. And then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process.",
      "But President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care. And that's why we had $50 million for rural hospitals in big, beautiful bill, why we tried to get $30 billion in for cost sharing and the Democrats didn't like that. They had an alternative approach.",
      "And so, I think that what we're going to see now, between now and Christmas, is that people are going to work this out because we have a solution \u2013 the White House has a solution for cost sharing and the Democrats have an alternative. And, you know, people don't want \u2013 you know, for the few seniors that have really, really massive increases to see those.",
      "But don't forget, the vast majority of people in the Affordable Care Act are getting their insurance for less than $50 a month. And so while this is an issue that needs to be worked out, we don't want to cause panic for the folks who are worried that they're going to lose the thing that they have. It's really just the very, very high cost people who are, you know, closer to retirement age that have the problem.",
      "NANCY CORDES: \"Bloomberg\" is reporting, as I'm sure you know, that you are now considered the frontrunner to replace Fed Reserve Chair Jay Powell when his term expires in the spring. Secretary Bessent, who is heading up this search, said he was holding final interviews this week. How did yours go?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, I am not sure that \"Bloomberg\" has the story right. I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates. The thing that I was most impressed about this week when that story leaked was that really I think the news for markets was that President Trump is close to announcing a new person who's going to replace Jay Powell. And if you look at the market response to that, it was very, very positive. We had a great Treasury auction. Interest rates went down.",
      "And so, I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates. And that's what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me, which, you know, is probably about as valuable as the rumor about the health care policy that we just talked about.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Well, I guess we'll find out if they're right, sooner rather than later, when we hear the president's decision.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. That's true.",
      "NANCY CORDES: So, for now, director of the White House National Economic Council, that's your title today, Kevin Hassett, thank you so much.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes. Thank you.",
      "NANCY CORDES: And we'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members.",
      "One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America. And we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina, this morning.",
      "Claire, thanks so much for being with us and Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT (CEO, Feeding America): Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely.",
      "So, during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again. But even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes. So, I'm so glad that you made that point. I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic as an example.",
      "We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system are people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs. So, this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big \u2013 missing rungs, if you will. So, we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well.",
      "We, as a nation, should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things. It will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yes, unfortunately, the lines are longer than the food that is available. And one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves as I have for mine, and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family off times to be able to do that. And then for them to turn up, in spite of all of those barriers and not \u2013 us not be able to provide them with what they really need.",
      "So, I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I have been a person who has experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do. So many of them are my heroes.",
      "And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network who show up, shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their wellbeing. So, we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So, the kinds of things that we ought to do, we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates. But we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around.",
      "NANCY CORDES: OK.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: And we can hold hands, shoulder to shoulder, because when \u2013 people experiencing hunger when we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "summary": "Officials have said the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, entered the U.S. as part of Operation Allies Welcome after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Sunday that the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members near the White House last week was \"radicalized since he's been here in this country\" after arriving in Sept. 2021 from Afghanistan.",
      "Officials have said the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, entered the U.S. as part of Operation Allies Welcome after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lakanwal was granted asylum by the Trump administration earlier this year. The CIA said Thursday that Lakanwal previously worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar that ended in 2021 following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "Since Wednesday's shooting, the Trump administration has ordered all asylum applications paused, according to an internal directive obtained by CBS News and two sources familiar with the order.",
      "\"We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,\" Noem said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" She provided no further details.",
      "On Wednesday, a gunman opened fire near the White House on National Guard members stationed in Washington. One of the victims, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died Thursday, while the other, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized.",
      "The suspect was shot by a National Guard member and is also hospitalized. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said he faces murder charges.",
      "On ABC's \"This Week,\" Noem suggested the suspect was not thoroughly vetted before he came to the U.S.",
      "\"What they did was check a few names and a few data points,\" Noem alleged. \"But what President Trump has put in place now for vetting is biometric information, checking social media platforms, communications, contacts, matching updates of service that was never done under Joe Biden. He didn't do that. In fact, he brought people to this country and then just said, well, we'll vet them later.\"",
      "The White House has blamed policies of former President Joe Biden's administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. Samantha Vinograd, a top counterterrorism official in the Obama administration and a current CBS News contributor, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there are no indications the \"horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure.\"",
      "\"Let's be clear on what the vetting system is and it isn't,\" Vinograd said. \"The vetting system is a system in which an individual's identifiers \u2014 their biographic information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images \u2014 are run against data sets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history. The vetting system is not predicative of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not going to become violent.\"",
      "Vinograd said every Afghan refugee underwent vetting overseas before being cleared to enter the U.S., and then they were vetted again by the Biden administration. The suspect in last week's shooting also underwent the \"most comprehensive vetting\" under the Trump administration to receive asylum, Vinograd added.",
      "Since the shooting, the White House has put in place a number of restrictive immigration policies. On Thursday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director ordered, at Mr. Trump's direction, a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card cases involving nationals affected by a presidential proclamation that fully or partially suspended travel and immigration from 19 countries.",

    "summary": "President Trump posted on social media that Venezuela's airspace should be considered as \"closed in its entirety.\"",
    "story": [
      "Venezuela said the U.S. has unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and seeks to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace,\" after President Donald Trump posted on social media that the country's airspace should be considered as \"closed in its entirety.\"",
      "In a statement released Saturday \u2014 in response to the message posted earlier by Mr. Trump \u2014 Venezuela's government demanded \"unrestricted respect\" for its airspace. \"Such statements constitute a hostile, unilateral, and arbitrary act, incompatible with the most basic principles of international law, and are part of a permanent policy of aggression against our country,\" the Venezuelan government release read in part.",
      "Mr. Trump had said in a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0that all airlines, pilots, drug dealers, and human traffickers should consider the airspace \"above and surrounding\" the South American nation as \"closed in its entirety\" \u2014 an assertion that appeared to signal further\u00a0U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about Mr. Trump's post, and it was unclear whether he was announcing a new policy or simply reinforcing the messaging around his\u00a0campaign against Maduro, which has involved\u00a0multiple strikes\u00a0in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean on small boats accused of ferrying drugs as well as a\u00a0buildup of naval forces\u00a0in the region.",
      "More than 80 people have been killed in such strikes since early September.",
      "International airlines last week began to cancel flights to Venezuela after the Federal Aviation Administration told pilots to be cautious flying around the country because of heightened military activity. Three U.S. airlines that regularly fly over Venezuela airspace confirmed to CBS News earlier this month that they had not been using the country's airspace for a while.",
      "The FAA's jurisdiction is generally limited to the United States and its territories. The agency does routinely warn pilots about the dangers of flying over areas with ongoing conflicts or military activity around the globe, as it did earlier this month with Venezuela. The agency, which works with other countries and the International Civil Aviation Organization on international issues, urged civilian aircraft in Venezuelan airspace to \"exercise caution\" due to the \"worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.\"",
      "\"No authority outside the Venezuelan institutionality has the power to interfere, block or condition the use of national airspace,\" the Venezuelan government said in its statement Saturday, citing ICAO rules. It also said that flights that were part of a plan to repatriate Venezuelan migrants had been \"unilaterally suspended\" as a result of U.S. actions.",
      "The FAA and ICAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to ratchet up pressure on Maduro. The U.S. government does not view Maduro as the legitimate leader of the oil-rich but increasingly impoverished South American nation and he faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.",
      "U.S. forces have conducted bomber flights near Venezuela and the USS Gerald R. Ford, America's most advanced aircraft carrier, was sent to the area. The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations. With the aircraft carrier's arrival, the \"Operation Southern Spear\" mission includes nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and Marines.",
      "There are bipartisan calls for greater oversight of the U.S. strikes against vessels in the region after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of the Sept. 2 attack on suspected drug smugglers.",
      "Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee \"will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:16:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The discovery could cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the\u00a0species of the famous Lucy, scientists said Wednesday.",
      "The discovery is the latest twist in the tale of human evolution and could even cast some doubt on the status of Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens.",
      "Until the foot was discovered in Burtele in northeastern Ethiopia in 2009, Lucy's species was thought to be the only human relative living in the area more than three million years ago.",
      "But the appendage clearly does not belong to Lucy's species because it has an opposable toe \u2014 similar to a thumb \u2014 allowing its owner to grab onto tree branches like apes.",
      "The team of scientists who found the mystery foot went on to name a new species, Australopithecus deyiremeda, in 2015 based on some roughly 3.4-million-year-old jaw bones found in Burtele.",
      "The announcement was met with some skepticism in scientific circles. Due to the scarcity of fossils, attempts to add a new branch to the human family tree usually provoke fierce debate.",
      "The team was also unable to say that the foot bones \u2014 dubbed the Burtele foot \u2014 belonged to their new species.",
      "Now, in a study published Tuesday called \"Mystery owner of African hominin foot identified,\" the scientists announced that new fossils including a jawbone with 12 teeth found at the site show that the foot was that of A. deyiremeda.",
      "\"We have no doubt about the Burtele foot belonging to the same species as these teeth and the jaw,\" lead study author, Yohannes Haile-Selassie of Arizona State University, told AFP.",
      "The research also revealed more details about this species, offering further clues about who could have been the true ancestor of us Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Co-existence is deep in our ancestry\"",
      "A CT scan of the teeth suggested that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than its cousin Lucy, the study said.",
      "Isotope analysis of the teeth meanwhile showed that its diet consisted mainly of leaves, fruit and nuts of trees.",
      "The grasping big toe also suggested this human relative spent more time in the trees. Big toes played an important role in human evolution, allowing our ancestors to leave the trees behind and walk on two legs.",
      "A lingering question about A. deyiremeda was how it could have co-existed with Lucy's species at the same place and time, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "The new research suggests that the former spent its time in the forest, more likely eating from trees, while the latter spent more time on the ground, a difference that allowed them to live together.",
      "It also demonstrates that \"co-existence is deep in our ancestry\", Haile-Selassie emphasised.",
      "Earlier this year, in the same region where was Lucy was discovered, archaeologists found 3,000-million-year-old knives that are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth.\u00a0 Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, told CBS News that discovery can\u00a0help frame humans' existence\u00a0on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "Search for the identity of our true ancestor",
      "John McNabb, a paleolithic archaeologist at the UK's University of Southampton not involved in the study, praised the new research.",
      "\"There will always be sceptics, but I think these new finds, and their validation of older ones, will help many researchers to be more accepting of A. deyiremeda,\" he told AFP.",
      "It also \"adds a new player into the mix\" in the search for the identity of our true ancestor, McNabb added.",
      "Because A. deyiremeda was more primitive and had a less human-like foot than Lucy, it is unlikely to dethrone her as the prime suspect in this search, both scientists agreed.",
      "But the discovery \"opens this possibility that we might still find more species within that time period because it looks like the Australopiths were experimenting with bipedality,\" or walking on two legs, Haile-Selassie said.",
      "\"Could there be another species which could be a better candidate to be the ancestor of the genus Homo?\" he asked.",
      "\"We don't know -- it depends on what we find.\"",

    "summary": "Researchers have documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life. NASA plans to return these core samples to Earth for laboratory analysis, but the delivery is on indefinite hold as the space agency pursues cheaper options.",
      "Blue Origin's Blue and Gold NASA satellites en route to study Mars",
      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",

    "story": [
      "American astronomer-turned-medical physicist and now NASA astronaut Chris Williams joined two Russian cosmonauts aboard a Soyuz ferry ship Thursday for a Thanksgiving Day flight to the International Space Station.",
      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",
      "Also  on hand to welcome Williams and his crewmates aboard the station: NASA  Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut  Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

    "title": "Kids with smartphones by age 12 at higher risk of health issues, study says",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:16:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can do the work currently performed by nearly 12% of America's workforce, according to a recent\u00a0study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The researchers, relying on a metric called the \"Iceberg Index\" that measures a job's potential to be automated, conclude that AI already has the cognitive and technical capacity to handle a range of tasks in technology, finance, health care and professional services.",
      "The index simulated how more than 150 million U.S. workers across nearly 1,000 occupations interact and overlap with AI's abilities. Specifically, it measures exposure to AI capabilities and how the rapidly emerging technology overlaps with workers' occupational skills.",
      "The study doesn't seek to shed light on how many workers AI may already have displaced or could supplant in the future. To what extent such tools take over job functions performed by people depends on a number of factors, including individual businesses' strategy, societal acceptance and possible policy interventions, the researchers note.",

      "For example, AI can streamline filling out paperwork, freeing nurses up to spend more time with patients. It can also quickly and accurately produce software code, forcing software engineers with limited skills to shift their focus.",
      "In addition, \"[F]inancial analysts will not disappear, but AI systems may demonstrate capability across significant portions of document-processing and routine analysis work,\" the researchers said. \"This reshapes how roles are structured and which skills remain in demand, without necessarily reducing headcount.\"",

      "\"AI systems now generate more than a billion lines of code each day, prompting companies to restructure hiring pipelines and reduce demand for entry-level programmers,\" the researchers wrote. \"These observable changes in technology occupations signal a broader reorganization of work that extends beyond software development.\"",

      "Kate Armstrong: I think it was rage. I think it was control and power that he wanted to exert over Kristil.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:44:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Luigi Mangione, the man charged with murdering the UnitedHealthcare CEO\u200b, is in court for hearings on which evidence will be allowed\u200b at trial.",
    "story": [
      "Luigi Mangione, the man charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was in court Monday for pretrial hearings about which evidence will be allowed in his upcoming trial in New York City.",
      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to nine state charges, including murder, as well as other federal charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty. Back in September, a judge dropped two other state terrorism charges against him.",
      "The 27-year-old's defense attorneys are arguing that certain evidence should be excluded from trial because of how they say it was obtained.",
      "Prosecutors with the Manhattan's district attorney's office have denied the defense's accusations, but the judge called for a series of suppression hearings to go over the concerns.",
      "The hearings are expected to last several days, and possibly all week. His trial date has not yet been set.",
      "A look inside the courtroom",
      "Mangione walked into court wearing a gray suit with a patterned button down shirt. He appeared to lift his eyebrows to acknowledge the court officers and his attorneys, but he did not look at the gallery. Per his attorneys' request, his restraints were removed before he sat down, so he can take notes.",
      "His attorneys had also requested he be allowed to wear civilian clothing during these hearings, rather than the tan prison clothing from his last court appearance. The judge granted him two suits, three shirts, three sweaters, three pairs of pants, five pairs of socks and one pair of shoes without laces that can be worn while he is being transported from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.",
      "Inside the courtroom, there appear to be roughly eight rows of journalists and three rows of the public, including some wearing shirts with Mangione's name or photo and the color green.",
      "Outside the courtroom, some people camped out to try and get a spot inside.",
      "The hearing was expected to begin around 10 a.m. but got off to a late start around 11 a.m.",
      "Mangione smiled as he chatted with his attorneys before the hearing began and took notes throughout.",
      "First look at Pennsylvania McDonald's surveillance video",
      "The first witness called to the stand was NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Sgt. Chris McLaughlin, who was asked to review surveillance images obtained in the hours and days after the shooting, including what appears to be a photo of Mangione standing at the counter of a Starbucks wearing a gray backpack and facemask with his nose showing, two photos of him inside an Upper West Side hostel without a facemask, and a Facebook post showing a man on a bicycle and a man with a gun.",
      "Mangione's attorneys objected to the relevance of the witness. While the photos were displayed, Mangione was seen taking notes and leaning over to speak with his lawyers.",
      "The prosecution also played video of the moment Thompson was shot nearly a year ago outside a hotel in midtown Manhattan, but stopped it before the husband and father of two fell to the ground.",
      "The second witness called to testify worked for the company that handled the security cameras at the McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Mangione was taken into custody\u00a0days after the shooting.",
      "For the first time, prosecutors shared security video from a McDonald's in Pennsylvania where Mangione was arrested. There was no audio for it. In the video, Mangione can be seen sitting and eating, and at one point speaking with officers.",
      "A 911 coordinator from Blair County, Pennsylvania then took the stand, before court broke for lunch. A 911 call from a manager at the McDonald's was played.",
      "\"I have a customer here that some other customers were suspicious of,\" the manager said in the recording. The manager went on to explain that the customers were really upset, and thought he looked like the person police were searching for in connection with Thompson's murder.",
      "The surveillance video shows Managione sit down at a side dining room near the restroom at 9:01 a.m. At 9:28 a.m., two officers approach him, and he stands with his hands in the air. Employees and customers can be seen coming and going while this is happening.",
      "At one point, Mangione is seated again and seems to be eating while speaking with officers. At around 9:40 a.m., more officers show up, and Mangione is eventually seen standing and being searched.",
      "\"Didn't want an Epstein-style situation\"",
      "Corrections officer Thomas Rivers testified next. He works at State Correctional Institution Huntington, the facility where Mangione was held after he was arrested. Mangione was placed there due to its increased security capabilities, Rivers said. Mangione was held there under a constant watch because \"SCI Huntington didn't want an Epstein-style situation,\" Rivers said, referring to the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Rivers testified he spoke with Mangione during his time being held at Huntington. They spoke about Mangione's travels in Thailand, including something Mangione said he saw - a \"gang fight between lady boys.\"",
      "Rivers said that Mangione talked about people who grow up in Third World countries grew up with a level of suffering not present in the U.S., but tend to be happier.",
      "Rivers said the two also talked about comparisons the media was making between Mangione and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, and they discussed books by George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Henry Thoreau.",
      "Here's what Mangione's attorneys are arguing",
      "Mangione's defense says statements he made to law enforcement should be suppressed, because they claim officers failed to provide Miranda warnings, which is when a suspect is informed of their constitutional rights.",
      "The defense also says evidence seized at the time of\u00a0his arrest at the McDonald's in Pennsylvania\u00a0shouldn't be allowed, because they claim law enforcement did a warrantless search of his backpack after he was handcuffed and surrounded by officers. Among the items inside the backpack were a gun with a\u00a03D printed receiver, ammunition and\u00a0a red notebook\u00a0he allegedly used as his diary.",
      "Defense attorneys don't want the notebook entries or other writings put into evidence at these pretrial hearings, claiming they will prejudice Mangione if they are made public and potential jurors hear about it.",
      "Lastly, the defense is also arguing against non-eyewitness identification testimony at trial, meaning someone who was not a witness to an alleged crime who makes an identification from a picture or video.",
      "Luigi Mangione's attorneys set to argue over what evidence should be admitted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Walshe trial opens with his explanation of wife's death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperbaric chamber experts testify in deadly Michigan explosion case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney Chris Madel announces Minnesota gubernatorial run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBronx man resentenced to time served for attempted murder conviction",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:24:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Sasha DiGiulian free-climbed the roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall in Yosemite National Park over the course of 23 days.",
    "story": [
      "American climber Sasha DiGiulian has become the first woman to free-climb El Capitan's longest route \u2014 a journey she said ended up being the \"most formative and challenging climb\" of her career.",
      "\"When we got to the top, after 23 days of this climb, I took a step and I just started laughing cause I was like, I haven't walked in so long,\" DiGuilian told CBS News in a phone interview Monday.",
      "DiGiulian free-climbed the roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall in Yosemite National Park over the course of more than three weeks, nine days of which were spent waiting out bad weather on a wall ledge. Having eyed El Cap for years, DiGiulian is one of the few to summit via the long and difficult Platinum route.",
      "\"For the last few years I've been so committed to this specific line ... This climb kind of consumed me,\" she said.",
      "DiGiulian, 33, and her climbing partner Elliot Faber were periodically accompanied by support personnel and a videographer.",
      "Made famous by the Oscar-winning documentary \"Free Solo,\" which captured climber Alex Honnold's famed ascent in June 2017, El Capitan is more than twice the height of the Empire State Building in the northern valley of Yosemite National Park in California.",
      "The rock formation has 17 different free-climbing routes, according to DiGulian. Free-climbing is when climbers ascend with their hands and feet, using equipment and ropes only to protect against falling, which they set up in between pitches, or anchor points. In longer climbs like on El Capitan, climbers divide up the terrain into pieces.",
      "DiGiulian holds a World Champion title in rock climbing and is based in Boulder, Colorado. She confirmed to CBS News that the climbing emoji is based on her image.",
      "DiGiulian said she and Faber arrived in Yosemite on Oct. 8 and began preparations to spend 14-16 days climbing the Platinum route, also known as the Direct Line, which has 39 pitches. They established rope points and hiked with more than 30 gallons of water to the top of the rock wall to be accessed later on.",
      "Faber helped establish the route years ago, mapping out credit card-sized protrusions on rock, but he had not actually climbed it. That changed on Nov. 3, when DiGiulian and Faber began their ascent.",
      "Although they incorporated weather windows into their planning, an unforeseen storm brought everything to an abrupt halt on day nine. The duo set up camp on the 32nd pitch known as the mountain's Golden Edge to wait out wind, rain, cold and snow.",
      "\"This is my portaledge,\" DiGiulian says in an Instagram video on Nov. 14.",
      "The pair used a Jetboil to cook, ate freeze-dried food for dinner, consumed Send bars (a line of green protein bars DiGiulian invented herself), rationed Kindle battery to read, and went back and forth on airplane mode to communicate with the world below. DiGiulian also said the tent door flapping in the wind made it difficult to sleep. Despite battling fatigue, boredom and the elements, she said they enjoyed incredible mountain views, glorious sunrises and days on end to contemplate their mission.",
      "\"The storm was kind of this mental but also physical challenge because you're just stripped of any sense of normal,\" DiGiulian said.",
      "Finally, after several days of being unable to climb, the weather started to let up. Despite the wet and slippery rock \u2014 very difficult climbing conditions \u2014 the pair resumed their ascent after 18 days on the wall, nine of which were spent waiting out the storm.",
      "The remaining terrain was some of the most difficult, and not made easier by the slick surfaces, DiGiulian said. She put on a helmet due to the ice chunks falling from the 400 feet above.",
      "\"I don't know what it is that enabled me to like to climb this route and get through it beyond just sheer drive to push myself,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Just short of the summit, Faber had to leave El Cap due to a family emergency. DiGiulian waited on the wall for two days, hoping they could finish together. When Faber was ultimately not able to return, he gave his partner his blessing to summit alone.",
      "\"He was just kind, I guess, between a rock and a hard place,\" DiGiulian said.",
      "Accompanied by some friends and a camera crew, DiGiulian summited El Capitan on Wednesday, Nov. 26, after a grueling 23 days \u2013 the first woman to free-climb the ascent on the Platinum route.",
      "It usually takes climbers multiple days to reach the summit, depending on the route's difficulty. El Capitan draws tens of thousands of climbers each year, according to Yosemite National Park, most taking 5-7 days to summit (on the easier routes, weather conditions permitting) and 60% of climbers typically succeed. Emily Harrington became the first woman to summit the rock formation in under 24 hours via the Golden Gate route in 2021.",
      "DiGiulian has been adventuring since childhood. \"Climbing is this space for me where I get to be really locked in and focused on what my physical and mental self is capable of,\" she said. \"I love puzzle solving.\"",

    "story": [
      "As one of America's coffee capitals, Portland, Oregon, has grounds for worry: coffee prices have soared to historic highs.",
      "\"We have bags of coffee on our menu that are $28.50. That's a lot of money for a bag of coffee,\" said Laila Ghambari, owner of Guilder Coffee Company, a caf\u00e9 that sells specialty coffee.",
      "Ghambari and her brothers practically grew up inside an espresso machine. Her father owned a coffee shop, and Ghambari became the U.S. barista champion in 2014. Now, she's a small business owner grappling with the expense of tariffs, which are still impacting her business even though coffee and other products were granted an exemption last month.",
      "\"Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,\" Ghambari said.",
      "Coffee prices were already high due to supply and demand pressures for premium beans along with climate issues, especially crop-killing frost. The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee hit a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, according to\u00a0the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In December 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, one pound of ground coffee cost a little over $4. And in August, retail coffee prices in the U.S. had jumped 20.9% from the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 the sharpest increase in nearly three decades.",
      "Then, back in April, the U.S. imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 10% on coffee-producing countries. Ghambari said it cost her roughly fifty cents a bag.",
      "Christopher Hendon, a chemistry professor at the University of Oregon   known as \"Dr. Coffee,\" studies the global industry and said the tariffs cost independent coffee operators more than consumers.",
      "\"[The consumer is] probably not feeling it,\" Hendon said. \"You might not care today, because the price didn't change all that much, but you might care if your local caf\u00e9 disappears.\"",

      "\"I had to lay off the two full-time employees. So now it's down to just myself and one part-time employee,\" Wicker said, adding, \"The fact that we're still standing is a function of having a little bit of savings to keep the lights on.\"",
      "Despite the reversal that lifted tariffs on coffee, relief will take time because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
      "Ghambari said it won't be until February when the first import of tariff-free coffees will land in her warehouse.",

      "The case worker, a volunteer who supported many Afghan families with business and finance-related issues, told CBS News that when they first met in 2022, Lakanwal did not speak good English, so they spoke thorough an interpreter. The worker described him as a very gracious host, chatty and charismatic. However, the case worker said, a severe turn in his personality was noticeable in 2024.",
      "In an email sent on Jan. 11, 2024, to the nonprofit group U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, the concerned case worker said Lakanwal had not worked in a year and his family had been served an eviction notice for nonpayment of rent. Details of the emails were\u00a0first published\u00a0by The Associated Press.",
      "\"World Relief volunteers are trying to patch things for that family \u2014 but I think the father has mental health issues that are not addressed, and he won't talk to anyone,\" the email, sent the year before Lakanwal's asylum claim was approved, read in part.",
      "World Relief is one of the refugee resettlement agencies that assisted in the relocation of Afghan evacuees. Washington state took in nearly 3,000 Afghan nationals, including Lakanwal, his wife and their five sons.",
      "The family had been living in Bellingham, and Lakanwal drove across the country to Washington, D.C., before the attack, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said during a news conference last week. One of the victims, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died Thursday, while the other, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically injured and remains hospitalized.",

      "\"He spends most of his time for weeks on end in his darkened bedroom, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife and older kids,\" the email said.",
      "The email also describes \"manic episodes for one or two weeks at a time where he will take off in the family car,\" but also \"interim\" periods where he \"tries to make amends.\" The case worker, who is not a mental health professional, later said in the email that they believed Lakanwal is suffering \"\u2026PTSD from his work with the US military in Afghanistan.\"",
      "According to a former Afghan commando who spoke with CBS News, Lakanwal led a unit of Afghan special forces in the south of the country and worked closely with the international troops before the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The former commando also said that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom the former commando said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024, which is a lawful immigration process overseen by the Department of Homeland Security. As part of that process, he would have gone through extensive vetting \u2014 including background checks, social media reviews, and in-person interviews. He had multiple, in-person asylum meetings at a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in 2024, the case worker said.",
      "He passed his reviews and was eventually granted asylum in April 2025.",
      "The case worker told CBS News that neither DHS nor USCIS ever reached out about the emails, and said they don't believe the government ever saw the emails or considered them in his asylum process.",
      "\"Rahmanulla was a man who was extremely proud and capable in the world he came from, who felt defeated in the world he came to,\" the case worker said.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that Lakanwal, who is facing murder charges, was \"radicalized since he's been here in this country.\"",
      "\"We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,\" Noem said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" She provided no further details.",
      "\"This violent act does not reflect the Afghan community, which continues to contribute across the United States and undergoes some of the most extensive vetting of any immigrant population,\" said Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for the resettlement of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military.",
      "Lakanwal was shot by another National Guard member during his attack and is also hospitalized. He has been sedated and placed on a ventilator since the shooting, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. The treatment has complicated investigators' efforts to interview him.",
      "As part of the investigation, U.S. intelligence analysts are combing Lakanwal's communications and online footprint for signs of international coordination or ideological radicalization, multiple U.S. officials said. An early review of his social media and messaging channels has not revealed links to foreign handlers or extremist groups.",

    "summary": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the commander of a September operation \"worked well within his authority and the law\" when ordering a follow-on strike.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House on Monday said a U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in September included more than one strike on the vessel, seemingly confirming a Washington Post report that the U.S. targeted the boat for a second time to take out survivors of the initial attack.",
      "The Post reported on Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors before the U.S. attack on a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the first strike left two men alive in the water. The paper said the commander of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley, ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the two. CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "The report sparked calls for an investigation by lawmakers of both parties in Congress, some of whom raised the prospect that targeting the survivors could constitute a war crime. Hegseth has called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Post's report during the White House briefing on Monday. \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\" a reporter asked.",
      "\"The latter is true,\" Leavitt replied, before reading out a written statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "At another point, CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked Leavitt: \"So was the initial order from Secretary Hegseth, 'everyone be killed,' and did that come from President Trump?\"",
      "\"I saw that quoted in a Washington Post story. I would reject that the secretary of war ever said that,\" Leavitt said. \"However, the president has made it quite clear that if narcoterrorists, again, are trafficking illegal drugs towards the United States, he has the authority to kill them. And that's what this administration is doing.\"",
      "Later on Monday, Hegseth wrote on social media that Bradley is \"an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support.\"",
      "\"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since,\" Hegseth said.",
      "President Trump said Sunday that he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike but defended Hegseth's handling of the incident, saying the secretary told him he did not order the subsequent attack.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One, saying he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth.",
      "He added: \"I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "A group of former military lawyers argued in an assessment on Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. In Congress, the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees pledged to investigate the matter. And Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that the strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" while GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio agreed that it \"would be an illegal act\" if true.",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who served in the role from 2011-2013 under former President Barack Obama, said on \"CBS Evening News\" Monday that the reported second strike constitutes a war crime \"because these individuals were injured. They were in the water.\"",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them,\" Panetta said. \"You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try protect their lives at that point. And that the concern right now whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "On Monday, GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\" But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed, adding that he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "The developments come as the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean since the first attack on Sept. 2.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he has concerns about the boat strikes more broadly, Mr. Trump said Sunday: \"Very little, because you can see the boats, you can see the drugs in the boats and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans.\"",
      "\"The amount of drugs coming into our country by sea is infinitesimal compared to what it was just a few months ago,\" the president said.",

    "story": [
      "Travelers around the United States faced delays at major airports during the busy holiday weekend, as winter weather disrupted airlines' schedules and software issues temporarily grounded a popular plane model in the days after Thanksgiving.",
      "There were 12,113 inbound and outbound flight delays reported across the U.S. on Sunday, according to the tracking site FlightAware. The tracker also showed 1,424 flight cancellations. Airports in Chicago, New York City, Boston, Des Moines, Fort Lauderdale and Detroit were among those most affected. There was also at least one rail disruption in Providence, Rhode Island, where a fire broke out beneath three Amtrak train cars with passengers inside. The Providence Fire Department said crews extinguished the fire and relocated the train cars, and no one was injured. CBS News reached out to Amtrak for information about wider delays but did not receive an immediate response.",
      "A powerful snowstorm in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions initially interrupted air travel for some in the wake of last week's holiday. National Weather Service offices issued a flurry of winter storm warnings and advisories from Montana to Ohio as a result, and forecasters cautioned that airport delays and slow-moving traffic would likely follow. That was especially true for places where snowfall was expected to accumulate at rates of more than one inch per hour.",
      "The storm at first dropped upwards of 8 inches of snow on northern Iowa, the National Weather Service said. By Saturday night, more than 1,400 flights were canceled at airports in Chicago, where the winter storm was expected to bring as much as 10 inches of snow, CBS Chicago reported.",
      "Similar accumulation was forecast in other parts of Illinois as well as in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Airports in Detroit faced more than 300 flight delays and dozens of cancellations as the storm moved over that area Saturday night, CBS Detroit reported.",
      "Airlines also reported disruptions over the weekend after the Federal Aviation Administration flagged thousands of Airbus A320 airliners around the world in need of software updates, including the one that Pope Leo XIV was using to travel around the Middle East.",

      "\"Additional cancellations are possible as we continue working through the software updates,\" the statement said. \"We understand the impact this has on customers, especially during a busy holiday travel period, and we are doing everything we can to minimize disruptions.\"",
      "FlightAware showed JetBlue had canceled 74 flights originally scheduled for Sunday, which was about 7% of its schedule. Asked whether the updates would be finished Sunday or continue into Monday, a JetBlue source told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that the airline was \"working as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines also confirmed that some of their Airbus planes required updates under the FAA directive.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:16:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

      "Known locally in Mexico as the \"Chapitos,\" or \"little Chapos,\" Joaquin Guzman Lopez and his brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, are accused of running a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. Federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send \"staggering\" quantities of fentanyl into the United States.",
      "Joaquin Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise.",
      "He and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the U.S. on a private plane. Both men have previously pleaded not guilty to various drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed.",
      "As part of the plea deal, Joaquin Guzman Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually.",
      "His defense attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, commended both U.S. and Mexican authorities.",
      "\"The government has been very fair with Joaquin thus far,\" he told reporters after the court hearing. \"I do appreciate the fact that the Mexican government didn't interfere.\"",
      "In July, Ovidio Guzman Lopez became the first son of drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman to enter a plea deal. He pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Legal experts called the plea deal a significant step for the U.S. government in their investigation and prosecution of Sinaloa cartel leaders.",
      "Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the U.S. over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father's former role as leaders of the cartel.",

    "summary": "Flyers without Real IDs, passports or other accepted forms of identification will need to pay a $45 fee starting Feb. 1.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",
      "What's an acceptable form of ID?",
      "Travelers with Real IDs or other accepted forms of identification don't have to pay the $45 fee to travel. Here are some of the documents the TSA says can substitute for a Real-ID-compliant driver's license:",
      "State-issued Enhanced Driver's License (EDL) or Enhanced ID (EID)U.S. or foreign government-issued passportU.S. passport cardDHS trusted traveler cards ((Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)U.S. Department of Defense IDPermanent resident cardBorder crossing card",

      "The TSA's website has a\u00a0complete list of compliant types of IDs.",
      "Who has a Real ID?",
      "The TSA noted that more than 94% of passengers currently use Real IDs or other acceptable forms of identification.",
      "The TSA had previously proposed a rule that would charge travelers without a Real ID an $18 fee at security checkpoints, according to a\u00a0notice\u00a0published in the Federal Register earlier this month.",
      "The cost of getting a Real ID varies by state. New York, for example, has no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the regular cost of getting a driver's license or renewing it, but\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees.",

      "Newell also\u00a0said in a statement that it will close roughly 20 Yankee Candle stores across the U.S. and Canada early next year as part of its cost-cutting plan. The layoffs are set to begin this month, according to the Atlanta-based company. Newell's other brands include Mr. Coffee, Oster, Rubbermaid and Sunbeam.",
      "The publicly listed company, whose shares have fallen nearly 62% this year amid slowing growth, launched a turnaround plan in 2023 as it tries to boost sales. The company has also said it will increase its use of automation and artificial intelligence to boost productivity.",
      "\"We've made meaningful progress executing our strategy and strengthening Newell Brands, but there is more work to do,\" Newell Brands president and CEO Chris Peterson said in a statement. \"This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance.\"",
      "In October, Newell reported third-quarter net sales of $1.8 billion, down 7.2% from the year-ago period. Net income for the quarter rose to $21 million, compared with a net loss of $198 million in the year-ago period.",
      "Newell did not disclose which Yankee Candle stores will close in January of 2026, but said the move \"aligns the brand's footprint with modern consumer shopping behaviors.\"",

    "summary": "The shooting raised questions about whether the government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
    "story": [
      "The shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week has sparked a national debate about U.S. immigration policy and whether the federal government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, identified by authorities as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, to further expand its government-wide immigration crackdown. The administration has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, ordered a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries and frozen all asylum case decisions.",
      "Lakanwal's exact motives remain unclear. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health deteriorated in recent years, and that he became isolated and detached from his family.",
      "Trump administration officials have blamed the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. in 2021, while critics of President Trump have faulted his government for approving his asylum case earlier this year. But a review of Lakanwal's immigration case, based on conversations with U.S. officials and other official sources, shows there were several opportunities for federal authorities, under both administrations, to vet Lakanwal and identify any potentially concerning information.",
      "This is what we know about the immigration process Lakanwal underwent to enter the U.S. and to try to remain here permanently.",
      "September 2021: Lakanwal arrives in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in September 2021 as part of \"Operation Allies Welcome,\" the Biden administration's effort to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees airlifted from Kabul following the chaotic American military withdrawal and Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.",
      "U.S. officials familiar with his case told CBS News that Lakanwal was granted humanitarian parole. Government statistics show parole was offered to more than 77,000 evacuees so they could live and work in the country legally for two-year increments. Parole was designed to be a stopgap measure while the evacuees applied for permanent forms of legal status, such as asylum or Special Immigrant Visas for those who assisted the American war effort.",
      "All Afghan evacuees were supposed to undergo an initial round of vetting at military bases in Italy, Germany, Qatar, Spain and the United Arab Emirates before being allowed to enter the U.S. Those who raised security concerns were sent to Kosovo. After arriving in the U.S., many evacuees were housed in American military bases in several states before settling in communities throughout the country.",
      "At the time, Republican lawmakers in Congress raised concerns about the vetting process undertaken by the Biden administration during the Afghan resettlement effort. A 2022 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General said the screening process encountered several obstacles and that some federal officials \"did not always have critical data\" to properly vet the evacuees.",
      "December 2024: Lakanwal requests asylum",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in December 2024, arguing he would face persecution if returned to Afghanistan, according to U.S. officials who requested anonymity to discuss internal government information.",
      "His application would have been another opportunity for the U.S. government to vet his case. USCIS generally requires asylum applicants to show up to in-person interviews at one of its offices across the country.",
      "A DHS official told CBS News the USCIS asylum vetting process generally involves the collection of biometrics, a review of social media activity, FBI background checks and other screenings. The process also includes an inquiry into whether the applicant can prove he or she would face persecution if deported because of one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a \"particular social group.\"",
      "In recent years, USCIS has been prioritizing Afghan asylum claims, processing them faster than the cases of other nationalities due to a Biden-era federal court settlement. The vast majority of Afghan asylum cases are approved. Government data shows 20,354 \u2014 96% \u2014 of 21,201 Afghan asylum requests decided by USCIS since the summer of 2021 were granted. Only 120 cases were denied during that time.",
      "Two U.S. officials and an ex-Afghan military official told CBS News that Lakanwal was part of a \"Zero Unit,\" one of a number of CIA-backed forces in the former Afghan government's military and intelligence apparatus that gained infamy for their secrecy and alleged brutality. That work could have made him a target for reprisals by the Taliban.",
      "April 2025: Lakanwal is granted asylum",
      "USCIS approved Lakanwal's asylum application in April 2025, granting him \u2014 and any derivative immediate relatives \u2014 asylee status, U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "While a grant of asylum is a determination that the applicant meets the legal definition of a refugee, it does not immediately bestow permanent legal status to the beneficiary. Asylees have to submit another application to request a green card, or lawful permanent resident status, which they can receive no sooner than one year after the grant of asylum. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that Lakanwal filed that application, known as an adjustment of status request, and that it was pending at the time of the attack.",
      "U.S. law allows the government to terminate someone's asylum status in certain circumstances, including when asylees commit serious crimes or fraud. A DHS official told CBS News that process requires USCIS to notify the asylee of the intent to terminate the status.",
      "Those whose asylum status is revoked are placed in deportation proceedings before federal immigration judges, who are overseen by the Justice Department. In Lakanwal's case, that process would likely not be finalized until after the adjudication of the criminal charges he faces because of last week's shooting.",

    "summary": "Juan Orlando Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of Honduras.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday that he will be pardoning former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who in 2024 was convicted in New York for drug trafficking and weapons charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison.",
      "The president explained his decision on social media by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "The idea drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hern\u00e1ndez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"",
      "A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia, said of the pardon on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to shove drugs up the nose of gringos and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday claimed it was a \"clear Biden overprosecution,\" alleging that there was some \"egregious\" information that came out during Hern\u00e1ndez's trial.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump announced his intention to pardon the ex-president, Hern\u00e1ndez's wife Ana Garc\u00eda and their adult children gathered on the steps of their home in Tegucigalpa.",
      "Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump, saying that Mr. Trump had corrected an injustice, maintaining that Hern\u00e1ndez's prosecution was a coordinated plot by drug traffickers and the \"radical left\" to seek revenge against the former president.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on Friday was part of a broader message by the U.S. president backing Tito Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Mr. Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Mr. Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"",
      "Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.",
      "In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.",
      "Mr. Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, who the Trump administration has accused of leading a drug cartel, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships, including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.",
      "The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.",
      "Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

      "Neither Habba nor the Justice Department immediately responded to requests for comment.",
      "Habba was tapped to serve as interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey earlier this year, but her appointment to the role was limited to 120 days, unless the U.S. district court in New Jersey voted to extend her tenure or she was confirmed to the post by the Senate. Habba's nomination, however, was unlikely to win approval in the upper chamber, as New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination.",
      "Ahead of the 120-day deadline, the judges in New Jersey declined to allow Habba to continue serving as U.S. attorney and instead voted to install her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position. But that decision was met with swift pushback from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who fired Grace.",
      "Then, Mr. Trump and top administration officials employed a multi-step maneuver to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and get around the district court's decision. First, the president withdrew Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Then, Habba resigned as interim U.S. attorney. Bondi then appointed Habba as \"special attorney\" and to fill Grace's role as first assistant U.S. attorney. Finally, because the position as the New Jersey's top prosecutor was vacant, Habba was elevated to the role of acting U.S. attorney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "That law, also known as the Vacancies Act, limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "In their decision, the judges on the 3rd Circuit found that the Trump administration's argument in support of Habba's role \"should raise a red flag,\" since it would allow the Justice Department to circumvent the Vacancies Act and effectively allow anyone to hold a U.S. attorney position indefinitely.",
      "\"Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U.S. Attorney indefinitely,\" Judge Michael Fisher wrote for the court. \"This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional [presidential appointment and Senate confirmation] process entirely. It also essentially eliminates the requirements of the FVRA and the U.S. Attorney-specific statute.\"",
      "Fisher was selected for the 3rd Circuit by President George W. Bush. He was joined in the decision by Judge L. Felipe Restrepo, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge D. Brooks Smith, tapped for the 3rd Circuit by Bush.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to install temporary U.S. attorneys in Nevada and Los Angeles using the mechanism it employed for Habba, but has faced resistance from the courts. The most high-profile of those decisions came last week, when a federal judge ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",

      "The defense argues certain evidence should not be allowed during trial, so the judge has scheduled a series of suppression hearings, which are expected to last several days, possibly a week.",
      "The evidence that Mangione's defense wants to suppress at trial",
      "Mangione's defense attorneys argue statements he made to law enforcement should be suppressed because they claim officers failed to provide Miranda warnings, which is when a suspect is informed of their constitutional rights.",
      "The defense also argues evidence seized at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, shouldn't be allowed because they claim law enforcement did a warrantless search of his backpack after he was handcuffed and surrounded by officers.",
      "Among the items inside the backpack were a gun with a 3D printed receiver, ammunition and a red notebook he allegedly used as his diary. One of the entries reads in part, \"The target is insurance. It checks every box.\"",
      "There was also a note to the FBI that read in part, \"Frankly, these parasites had it coming.\"",
      "\"The prosecution argues that there was good reason to search the bag immediately because they had to find out if there was anything dangerous in the bag,\" explained legal analyst Rich Schoenstein. \"If you've just arrested somebody who you think has shot a man in the back in the middle of the street, you might be worried about what else is in that bag, and indeed there was a weapon in that bag, so I think the prosecution has the stronger argument here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Armed men entered through a window to ambush Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the most elusive of the Sinaloa cartel's leaders, who was then loaded onto a plane, drugged and spirited across the border to the United States, according to details revealed Monday in the plea hearing of the drug trafficker who abducted him.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, the 39-year-old son of former Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise in federal court in Chicago after admitting his role in overseeing the transport of tens of thousands of pounds of drugs to the U.S.",
      "As part of that plea agreement, U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions in the hours and days immediately after Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
      "How did the wily drug capo who had stayed ahead of authorities for decades end up in the United States like a present tied with bow?",
      "The plea agreement did not name Zambada, but in the days after his arrest, one of his lawyers shared a letter from him that explained he had been called to a meeting with Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and there he had been abducted.",
      "Andrew Erskine, an attorney representing the U.S. government, said Monday the alleged kidnapping of an unnamed individual was part of an attempt to show cooperation with Washington, which he said did not sanction those actions. He also said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez would not receive cooperation credit because of that.",
      "The arrest of both drug traffickers by U.S. authorities angered Mexico's then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who suspected the U.S. government was behind the operation. Washington denied involvement from the outset, but experts thought it would be virtually impossible to pull off without U.S. authorities having some knowledge.",
      "Erskine described the alleged kidnapping in court, saying Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had the glass from a floor-to-ceiling window removed from a room ahead of the meeting with the unnamed person.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez allegedly had others enter through the open window, seize the individual, put a bag over his head and take him to a plane. On board, he was zip tied and given sedatives before the plane landed at a New Mexico airport near the border with Texas.",
      "Zambada in his letter said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had called him to a meeting on the outskirts of Sinaloa state's capital, Culiacan, along with some local politicians, one of whom was later found dead.",
      "He said when he arrived there were a lot of armed men in green military uniforms, who he assumed were gunmen for the \"Chapitos,\" as \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons were known. According to a 2023 U.S. indictment, the Chapitos and their cartel associates used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Even though they ran a rival faction within the cartel, Zambada maintained communication with them and appeared to trust Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez enough to follow him into a dark room.",
      "On the plane that landed in New Mexico were only the pilot, Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. Aboard the plane, Zambada was given a drink containing sedatives, which Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez also drank a little of, according to Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez's account.",
      "Rather than congratulating or thanking the U.S. for arresting the elusive Zambada, Mexico's Attorney General's Office said it was studying the possibility of bringing treason charges against Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez or whoever else aided in the plot.",
      "The arrests set off a bloody fight in Sinaloa among their respective cartel factions for control of the business, violence that L\u00f3pez Obrador's successor President Claudia Sheinbaum is still dealing with.",
      "With the plea deal, Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez's defense attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he is expected to avoid life in prison.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years.",
      "In May, Mexico's security chief confirmed that\u00a017 family members\u00a0of the cartel leaders crossed into the U.S. as part of a deal between a son of the former head of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Trump administration. El Chapo's ex-wife, Griselda Lopez Perez, and her daughter were among the family members to enter the U.S.,\u00a0local media reported.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were scheduled to attend what sources described as a decisional meeting regarding the next steps in the escalating pressure campaign against the Maduro regime.",
      "Mr. Trump said recently he's spoken with Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, while the U.S. president has also built up a significant military force in the region as a part of what he's described as an anti-drug campaign against the cartels his administration has designated as terror groups. The State Department has designated Maduro himself as a terrorist.",
      "CNN was first to report the meeting, which comes amid the president's looming threats of military action on land and intensifying scrutiny by lawmakers over the Pentagon's lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Monday that the president would meet with his national security team on Venezuela and \"on many matters.\" Details on the planned meeting have not emerged.",
      "The Washington Post reported Friday that Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors in the first U.S. strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean. The U.S. attack on the vessel was announced by Mr. Trump on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the initial strike left two survivors in the water, and the commander of the operation then ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the survivors.",
      "A working group of former judge advocates general said that if this is true, it would constitute \"war crimes, murder, or both.\" The group pointed to the Geneva Conventions, which says that members of armed forces who are out of the fight because of \"sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely,\" and acts including \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds\" are banned. The U.S. military has killed at least 80 people in boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific in \"Operation Southern Spear,\" which it says is targeting narco-terrorists.",
      "The JAG group called on Congress to probe any use of the military involving \"the intentional targeting of anyone \u2013 enemy combatants, non-combatants, or civilians \u2013 rendered hors de combat (\"out of the fight\") as a result of their wounds or the destruction of the ship or aircraft carrying them.\"",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a reported second strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year, while pledging to look into the incident.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine and if there were two people around,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One. \"But Pete said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was also asked Monday evening about whether he has confidence in Hegseth and about the boat strike.",
      "\"The question will be based on the facts as we find them out,\" he responded. \"We're going to have some discussions within the committee. Until such times we know the full facts, we won't be making comment.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said that Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\" But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed, adding that he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump warned that Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed, and Venezuela said the U.S. had unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and wants to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace.\"",
      "The Trump administration says it's aiming to stop drugs from being smuggled into the U.S., while Venezuela says Mr. Trump seeks Maduro's ouster. Over the past several weeks, the U.S. has moved a number of military ships to the western Atlantic and the Caribbean and reopened a naval base in Puerto Rico.",
      "On Sunday, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",
      "\"If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Kaine has introduced war powers resolutions to prevent Mr. Trump from conducting strikes against Venezuela, although his efforts have fallen short in the Senate.

      "The U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat \u2014 the first salvo in a months-long string of attacks \u2014 has drawn new scrutiny in recent days, as the White House confirmed that the vessel was struck twice.",
      "The confirmation followed a Washington Post report that the first boat was struck a second time, killing a pair of survivors \u2014 prompting calls for investigations and concerns in Congress that the follow-up strike may have constituted a war crime. A\u00a0Pentagon manual on the law of war says combatants that are \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the series of boat strikes, casting them as a necessary tactic to stem the flow of narcotics from South America. But U.S. officials have not provided specific evidence that the vessels were smuggling drugs or posed a threat to the U.S. Some lawmakers from both parties have questioned the\u00a0 legality of the strikes.",
      "Here's what we know about the Sept. 2 strike and what the administration has said:",
      "Sept. 2: Trump says military \"shot out a boat\"",
      "President Trump announces to reporters during a Sept. 2 event that the U.S. had \"literally shot out a boat\" from Venezuela that he alleged was carrying drugs earlier in the day.",
      "In social media posts later that day, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the attack in further detail, and referred to it as a single strike.",
      "The president said on Truth Social that the strike had killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated as a terrorist group earlier this year. Mr. Trump posted a 29-second video that showed one strike on a boat.",
      "Mr. Trump said the boat was headed to the U.S., but Rubio said later in the day that the drugs were \"probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.\"",
      "The following day, Rubio stated that it was \"headed towards, eventually, the United States.\"",
      "Sept. 3: Hegseth says he \"watched it live\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes back on a Venezuelan official's claim that the video of the Sept. 2 strike may have been fake, telling \"Fox and Friends\" the following morning: \"I watched it live. We knew exactly who was in that boat. We knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Sept. 4: U.S. had \"absolute and complete authority\" to hit boat, Hegseth says",
      "Asked by CBS News what legal authority the Pentagon cited to strike the boat, Hegseth says: \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that.\" He called the importation of drugs to the U.S. an \"assault on the American people.\"",
      "Separately, the White House told Congress on Sept. 4 that it believes the strike was \"consistent with [the president's] responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests,\" according to a notification later obtained by CBS News.",
      "Sept. 11: Boat was allegedly turning around",
      "The New York Times and CBS News report the boat appeared to be turning around when it was hit. A source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the individuals onboard the boat saw a military aircraft overhead and attempted to turn back before the U.S. hit the boat.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement, \"The President acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring poison to our shores.\"",
      "Sept. 15: Another boat is hit",
      "Mr. Trump announces another strike against an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean, killing three \"male terrorists.\"",
      "The administration later said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in a message to Congress justifying the Sept. 15 strike that was viewed by CBS News. It called the three individuals killed in the second strike \"unlawful combatants.\"",
      "In total, the U.S. has struck more than 20 boats between early September and mid-November, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Oct. 16: Key admiral announces retirement",
      "Hegseth announces that Adm. Alvin Holsey will retire as commander of U.S. Southern Command at year's end. Holsey was one year into his tenure overseeing the region where the boat strikes took place. Typically, combatant commanders serve for three years on average.",
      "Separately, CBS News reported that two people survived a strike on a boat in the Caribbean on Oct. 16. Mr. Trump later said the survivors would be returned to their countries of origin. The two, from Ecuador and Colombia, were repatriated within a few days of the strike.",
      "Nov. 28: Report says the first strike left survivors who were then killed in second attack",
      "The Washington Post reports that the Sept. 2 strike left two survivors, who clung to the boat's wreckage before dying in a follow-on attack. The Post reported that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth ordered everybody to be killed.",
      "Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory.\"",
      "\"The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.\"",
      "He also defended the strikes' legality once again.",
      "In response, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Nov. 28 that they would conduct \"vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee released a statement promising to gather a full accounting of the operation.",
      "Nov. 30: Senator says it may rise \"to the level of a war crime\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia says on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the reported follow-on strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" pointing to international and domestic laws on attacks against wounded combatants.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, expresses similar concerns, saying, \"Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that \u2026 would be an illegal act.\"",
      "Nov. 30: Trump responds",
      "On Air Force One, the president tells reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a second strike on the boat.",
      "He added that Hegseth said he didn't order a follow-on strike, and \"I believe him 100%.\"",
      "Dec. 1: Leavitt confirms a second strike",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirms that there was a follow-on strike, but denied that it was done at Hegseth's behest. She says Adm. Mitch Bradley, who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the operation, was authorized by Hegseth to conduct strikes.",
      "A reporter asked Leavitt: \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\"",
      "She responded: \"The latter is true.\"",
      "Leavitt then read a prepared statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "Leavitt later told CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that she \"would reject\" that Hegseth ever said that everyone in the boat on Sept. 2 should be killed.",
      "Dec. 1: Senate Armed Services chair says he expects to obtain all the audio and video from the strikes",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen.

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff are meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, a White House source confirmed, as Mr. Trump presses for an end to the fighting in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting comes after U.S. and Ukrainian officials held talks in Florida over the weekend. Witkoff has met with Putin before, as he has turned his focus toward Ukraine after he and Kushner helped broker the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The U.S. backed a peace proposal to end Russia's war on Ukraine last month, although much more work remains to be done. Putin has called U.S. proposals a \"set of issues put forward for discussion\" rather than a draft agreement. Last week, Mr. Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement,\" after a U.S. official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend that the U.S.-backed plan, which was originally 28 points, has evolved, after some alleged it was heavily slanted toward Russia's priorities, with one provision calling for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Those two things aren't going to be seen as concessions to European leaders, who believe Russia should give back Ukrainian territory it has occupied. Ukraine has also pushed for security guarantees as part of any deal to end the war, though Russia has rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, which would obligate the U.S. and other member states to come to its defense.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Florida for the talks with the Ukrainians over the weekend, called the conversations with the Ukrainians \"another very productive session\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "\"We don't just want to end the war. We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever,\" he said. \"So never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity. It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity.\"",
      "On Sunday, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio voiced concerns that the White House approach could be too pro-Russia.",
      "Asked by CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America First and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "Peace is far from a reality on the ground in Ukraine, as Russian missiles rained down again on Kyiv over the weekend, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from western Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered high praise for Witkoff's negotiating skills and personable nature, and given him an increasingly large portfolio. The White House did not dispute a phone transcript published by Bloomberg last week in which Witkoff reportedly advised Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, on how Putin should approach Mr. Trump in peace negotiations.",
      "\"This story proves one thing: Special Envoy Witkoff talks to officials in both Russia and Ukraine nearly every day to achieve peace, which is exactly what President Trump appointed him to do,\" White House communications director Steven Cheung said in response to the transcript Bloomberg published.",

      "The Post reported on Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors before the U.S. attack on a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the first strike left two men alive in the water. The paper said the commander of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley, ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the two. CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The shooting raised questions about whether the government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
    "story": [
      "The shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week has sparked a national debate about U.S. immigration policy and whether the federal government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, identified by authorities as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, to further expand its government-wide immigration crackdown. The administration has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, ordered a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries and frozen all asylum case decisions.",
      "Lakanwal's exact motives remain unclear. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health deteriorated in recent years, and that he became isolated and detached from his family.",
      "Trump administration officials have blamed the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. in 2021, while critics of President Trump have faulted his government for approving his asylum case earlier this year. But a review of Lakanwal's immigration case, based on conversations with U.S. officials and other official sources, shows there were several opportunities for federal authorities, under both administrations, to vet Lakanwal and identify any potentially concerning information.",
      "This is what we know about the immigration process Lakanwal underwent to enter the U.S. and to try to remain here permanently.",
      "September 2021: Lakanwal arrives in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in September 2021 as part of \"Operation Allies Welcome,\" the Biden administration's effort to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees airlifted from Kabul following the chaotic American military withdrawal and Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.",
      "U.S. officials familiar with his case told CBS News that Lakanwal was granted humanitarian parole. Government statistics show parole was offered to more than 77,000 evacuees so they could live and work in the country legally for two-year increments. Parole was designed to be a stopgap measure while the evacuees applied for permanent forms of legal status, such as asylum or Special Immigrant Visas for those who assisted the American war effort.",
      "All Afghan evacuees were supposed to undergo an initial round of vetting at military bases in Italy, Germany, Qatar, Spain and the United Arab Emirates before being allowed to enter the U.S. Those who raised security concerns were sent to Kosovo. After arriving in the U.S., many evacuees were housed in American military bases in several states before settling in communities throughout the country.",
      "At the time, Republican lawmakers in Congress raised concerns about the vetting process undertaken by the Biden administration during the Afghan resettlement effort. A 2022 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General said the screening process encountered several obstacles and that some federal officials \"did not always have critical data\" to properly vet the evacuees.",
      "December 2024: Lakanwal requests asylum",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in December 2024, arguing he would face persecution if returned to Afghanistan, according to U.S. officials who requested anonymity to discuss internal government information.",
      "His application would have been another opportunity for the U.S. government to vet his case. USCIS generally requires asylum applicants to show up to in-person interviews at one of its offices across the country.",
      "A DHS official told CBS News the USCIS asylum vetting process generally involves the collection of biometrics, a review of social media activity, FBI background checks and other screenings. The process also includes an inquiry into whether the applicant can prove he or she would face persecution if deported because of one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a \"particular social group.\"",
      "In recent years, USCIS has been prioritizing Afghan asylum claims, processing them faster than the cases of other nationalities due to a Biden-era federal court settlement. The vast majority of Afghan asylum cases are approved. Government data shows 20,354 \u2014 96% \u2014 of 21,201 Afghan asylum requests decided by USCIS since the summer of 2021 were granted. Only 120 cases were denied during that time.",
      "Two U.S. officials and an ex-Afghan military official told CBS News that Lakanwal was part of a \"Zero Unit,\" one of a number of CIA-backed forces in the former Afghan government's military and intelligence apparatus that gained infamy for their secrecy and alleged brutality. That work could have made him a target for reprisals by the Taliban.",
      "April 2025: Lakanwal is granted asylum",
      "USCIS approved Lakanwal's asylum application in April 2025, granting him \u2014 and any derivative immediate relatives \u2014 asylee status, U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "While a grant of asylum is a determination that the applicant meets the legal definition of a refugee, it does not immediately bestow permanent legal status to the beneficiary. Asylees have to submit another application to request a green card, or lawful permanent resident status, which they can receive no sooner than one year after the grant of asylum. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that Lakanwal filed that application, known as an adjustment of status request, and that it was pending at the time of the attack.",
      "U.S. law allows the government to terminate someone's asylum status in certain circumstances, including when asylees commit serious crimes or fraud. A DHS official told CBS News that process requires USCIS to notify the asylee of the intent to terminate the status.",
      "Those whose asylum status is revoked are placed in deportation proceedings before federal immigration judges, who are overseen by the Justice Department. In Lakanwal's case, that process would likely not be finalized until after the adjudication of the criminal charges he faces because of last week's shooting.",

    "story": [
      "A Brazilian teenager was mauled by a lioness in full view of zoo visitors on Sunday, after scaling a six-meter wall and safety fencing and shimmying down a tree into the enclosure, authorities said.",
      "The municipal government of the coastal city of Joao Pessoa said a young man \u2014 identified by Brazilian media as Gerson de Melo Machado, 19 \u2014 had \"deliberately invaded the lioness's enclosure\" at the Arruda Camara Zoobotanical Park.",
      "\"In a rapid and surprising manner, he climbed a wall over six meters high, scaled the security bars, accessed one of the trees, and entered the enclosure,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "Viral videos of the attack showed the lioness, Leona, lying next to the glass separating her from visitors, who gasp in shock as the teen shimmies down a tree.",
      "The lioness spots him and makes a beeline for the tree, pulling Machado down to the ground. Bushes are seen shaking, and the teen stands up one more time before disappearing from view.",
      "\"It got him. It got him,\" visitors can be heard saying, with exclamations of \"my God!\"",
      "The government statement said Machado \"died from injuries caused by the animal.\"",
      "The zoo said in a statement on Instagram that the incident was \"extremely sad\" and that it was closed while investigations continue.",
      "\"We reiterate that the park follows rigorous technical standards and safety protocols, and we are fully cooperating with all responsible bodies to clarify the facts,\" the zoo said.",
      "In a separate Instagram post, the park said that \"euthanasia was never considered\" for Leona, who \"shows no aggressive behavior outside the context of the incident.\"",
      "\"The Bica team, veterinarians, handlers, and technicians are fully dedicated to Leona's well-being, ensuring that she recovers, stabilizes emotionally, and resumes her routine safely,\" the park said.",
      "Park vet Thiago Nery defended safety standards around the lion enclosure, which he said has more than eight meters of protection.",
      "\"This incident was completely unforeseeable, outside any scenario within the park's routine,\" he said.",
      "The government statement said initial investigations showed \"the man's actions may have been a possible suicide attempt.\"",
      "Child protection counselor Veronica Oliveira said in a video on Instagram that she had accompanied Machado for eight years as he \"went through all the institutional care in this city.\"",
      "She said his mother and grandparents suffered from schizophrenia, but state psychiatrists said he merely \"had a behavioral problem.\"",
      "\"He should have been in treatment,\" she said.",
      "In other media interviews, Oliveira said Machado had dreamed of being a lion tamer, and once cut through an airport fence and hid in the landing gear of a plane he thought was going to Africa.",
      "\"Society, without knowing your story, preferred to throw you into the lion's den,\" she said.",
      "Fatal lion attacks at zoos are extremely rare, but this marks the second such incident in fewer than three months. In September, a zookeeper in Thailand was killed by lions after he stepped out of his vehicle at a safari park.",
      "Last October, a group of lions\u00a0mauled a zookeeper\u00a0to death in Crimea after a door inside their enclosure was left unlocked.",
      "In 2018, a lion escaped its enclosure and\u00a0killed a recent college graduate\u00a0at a North Carolina conservatory during a routine cleaning. Authorities were told the lion was able to enter the same space as 22-year-old Alex Black because a large\u00a0ball prevented the lion's pen\u00a0from closing.",

      "\"I was so nervous. I immediately got my clothes, phone and went downstairs,\" he said.",
      "He never imagined that the blaze at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong would spread so quickly. It tore through bamboo scaffolding, mesh netting covering it, and then foam window coverings that had adorned the sprawling complex's eight buildings for ongoing renovation work.",
      "\"I got outside and saw a big fire,\" he told CBS News on Monday, as the official death toll from the blaze climbed to over 150. \"Fire was spreading everywhere, and I could hear the bamboo exploding. The fire spread to the other block. The mesh caught alight.\"",
      "That other block was his own building, where he knew his wife was still upstairs. He watched as the blaze spread up the sides, quickly blocking the main lobby.",
      "\"I called my wife immediately and said there's a big fire and we have to go now,\" the 67-year-old recalled through tears. \"I told my wife, don't come down.\"",
      "He had hoped that firefighters would be able to get the blaze under control before it was too late.",
      "On the other end of the phone, his distraught wife, Bai Shui Lin, told him she couldn't move through the thick smoke.",

      "\"I kept waiting, hoping the fire would be put out. I thought maybe only the outside would be affected. But the fire just kept getting bigger,\" he said.",
      "As the blaze spread to seven of the buildings on the complex, Yip watched from behind a police cordon for any sign of his wife being carried out, but he never saw her.",
      "He said he pored over lists of photos and names of victims for days as the death toll mounted, giving her description to nearby hospitals in the hope that she had been rescued.",
      "\"I couldn't find my wife,\" he said through tears. \"I tried everything.\"",
      "Five days later, police confirmed his worst fears in a phone call on Monday. Bai, his wife of 40 years, never made it out of their building.",
      "The couple's two sons had to confirm her identification, but her remains were burned so badly that authorities used an ID card found in her purse to verify it was her.",
      "Yip said she had gone door to door, warning neighbors of the fire that had spread to their building. He said she helped at least three other families make it out before it was too late.",
      "Both of their sons survived the catastrophic fire, but Yip said he was struggling with guilt over the loss of his wife.",

    "story": [
      "The World Health Organization issued new guidelines Monday recommending the use of GLP-1 drugs for treating obesity.",
      "In the\u00a0new guidelines, the United Nations health agency made two key recommendations \u2014 first, that GLP-1 therapies may be used by adults for long-term treatment of obesity, except for pregnant women. It also recommended intensive behavioral therapy, including changes related to diet and exercise, alongside the use of the medications.",
      "\"Obesity is a major global health challenge that WHO is committed to addressing by supporting countries and people worldwide to control it, effectively and equitably. Our new guidance recognizes that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care,\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom\u00a0 Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said in a news release. \"While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms.\"",
      "Both recommendations, however, are considered \"conditional.\" WHO noted that the first recommendation is considered \"conditional\" due to limited data on the medications' long-term efficacy and safety, as well as costs and other factors. The second recommendation was graded \"conditional\" based on \"low-certainty evidence\" that intensive behavioral therapy enhances GLP-1  treatment outcomes.",
      "Still, the organization calls the drugs \"more than a scientific breakthrough.\"",
      "\"They represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity-from a 'lifestyle condition' to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease,\" says an article published online Monday in the peer-reviewed medical journal  JAMA. The article was co-written by Francesca Celletti, who is senior advisor for obesity at WHO's Nutrition and Food Safety department.",
      "The World Health Organization highlighted the importance of equitable access to GLP-1 drugs, saying that it is calling for \"urgent action on manufacturing, affordability, and system readiness to meet global needs.\"",
      "\"Even with rapid expansion in production, GLP-1 therapies are projected to reach fewer than 10% of those who could benefit by 2030,\" WHO says.",
      "Well-known brand names of GLP-1 drugs in the U.S. include Ozempic and Mounjaro, which are FDA approved for treating diabetes, and Wegovy and Zepbound, which are approved for weight loss.",
      "WHO estimates that obesity affects more than 1 billion people globally and was associated with 3.7 million deaths last year. It also notes that in September, it added GLP-1 therapies to its \"Essential Medicines List\" for managing type 2 diabetes in groups that are high-risk.",

    "summary": "Diplomats have been focused on revisions to a proposed plan developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Sunday's session \u2014 which included special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump, and Ukrainian delegates \u2014 as \"productive and useful,\" but talks will continue this week in Moscow with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"We don't just want to end the war. We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever. So never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity,\" he said. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we build on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"",
      "Witkoff is set to travel to Moscow on Monday, a U.S. official later confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The negotiations come at a sensitive moment for Ukraine as it continues to push back against Russian forces that invaded in 2022 while dealing with a domestic corruption scandal.",
      "Diplomats have been focused on revisions to a proposed\u00a0plan\u00a0developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticized as being too weighted toward Russian demands. During the meeting Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine.",
      "Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's secretary of national security, thanked American negotiators in brief remarks following the meeting but provided little detail of their discussion.",
      "\"We discussed all the important matters that are important for Ukraine, for Ukrainian people and us, was super supportive. We were already had a successful meeting in Geneva, and today we continue this success,\" Umerov said. \"So at the moment, this meeting was productive and successful on the later stages, hopefully we'll keep you updated.\"",
      "Umerov has been involved in ongoing talks. But until now, Ukraine's head negotiator had been\u00a0Andriy Yermak, the powerful chief of staff of Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Friday, Zelenskyy announced the resignation of Yermak, after his home was searched by anti-corruption investigators.",
      "Zelenskyy's government has been roiled by fallout from a\u00a0scandal over $100 million\u00a0embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors, causing newfound domestic pressures for Zelenskyy.",
      "It was only a week ago that Rubio had met with Yermak in Geneva, with each side saying the talks had been positive in putting together a revised peace plan.",
      "Among the other members of the Ukrainian delegation were Andrii Hnatov, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, and presidential adviser Oleksandr Bevz.",
      "The plan, which Mr. Trump has since played down as a \"concept\" or a \"map\" to be \"fine-tuned,\" would have imposed limits on the size of Ukraine's military, blocked the country from joining NATO and required Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days. Negotiators have indicated the framework has changed, but it's not clear how its provisions have been altered.",
      "It had initially envisioned Ukraine ceding the entire eastern region of the Donbas\u00a0to Russia \u2014 a sticking point for Kyiv.",
      "On Tuesday, Witkoff and Kushner will be meeting with Putin in Moscow about Ukraine, a White House official said Monday. Both Witkoff and Kushner, like Mr. Trump, hail from the world of real estate that values dealmaking over the conventions of diplomacy. The pair also were behind a 20-point proposal that led to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Zelenskyy wrote on X that the Ukrainian delegation would \"swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war.\"",
      "In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelenskyy said the American side was \"demonstrating a constructive approach.\"",
      "\"In the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,\" he said.",

    "summary": "As the death toll in the Hong Kong apartment complex fire tops 150, Chinese authorities seek to stifle criticism amid new revelations of safety violations.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 As the confirmed death toll from the Hong Kong apartment complex fire climbed to at least 151 on Monday, officials said their investigation into the blaze had found that mesh used to cover scaffolding for ongoing renovations was not up to fire-safety codes.",
      "Frustration over what appears to have been clear safety lapses ahead of the devastating fire \u2014   which took more than two days to extinguish as it engulfed seven of the complex's eight towers \u2014 was being met with government moves to stifle criticism.",
      "Initial tests of the netting that had enshrouded the scaffolding showed it met safety regulations, but Hong Kong officials said Monday that investigators had since gained access to more areas to collect samples, including from higher floors.",
      "Hong Kong Chief Secretary Eric Chan said seven of the 20 new samples of the synthetic mesh had failed fire safety standards, suggesting contractors may have opted for cost-saving over the safety of residents and workers.",
      "\"They just wanted to make money at the expense of people's lives,\" Chan told reporters.",
      "Recovery teams found another eight bodies, including those of three firefighters located earlier but which workers had been unable to retrieve, Tsang Shuk-yin, head of the Hong Kong police's casualty enquiry unit told reporters on Monday. She said more than 30 people were still listed as missing, but some were likely among the nearly 40 sets of remains recovered but yet to be identified.",
      "\"We will have to wait until we get through all seven blocks before we can make a final report,\" she said, adding that some remains were likely so badly burned that identification could prove impossible.",
      "About 4,600 people lived in the eight buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex, which is in the Hong Kong suburb of Tai Po, not far from the border with mainland China.",
      "Monday was to be the last day of an official mourning period declared by authorities, and thousands of people turned out to pay their respects, laying flowers, toys and notes for the victims, many of whom where children and the elderly.",
      "Police have released photos from inside the charred buildings, where they found the bodies of residents who had tried to escape the inferno in stairwells and on rooftops.",
      "One deeply distraught man at the scene on Monday told CBS News that his sons had just identified the remains of his 66-year-old wife, who died in the fire. He said he was demanding answers from the government as to how the disaster could have happened.",
      "Anger has mounted in Hong Kong since the fire erupted on Wednesday morning last week. It had already been revealed that the fire alarms were turned off in the complex, and for months, residents had issued warnings about what they believed to be hazardous materials covering the buildings during the renovation.",
      "As of Monday, 14 people had been arrested for suspected manslaughter, and authorities were not ruling out further arrests.",
      "The level of public angst has rattled Beijing, to the extent that the central government issued a warning to Hong Kongers against any protests or using the fire to \"disrupt\" life in the city.",
      "The warning drew parallels to the crackdown on pro-democracy protests that paralyzed the city in 2019.",
      "Three people had been arrested on Monday under a sweeping national security law imposed in the wake of those protests. Their lawyer says they were detained for starting a petition calling for an independent inquiry into the fire \u2014   a sign of how concerned Beijing is that the tragedy could lead to fresh civil unrest in the previously semi-autonomous southern metropolis.",

    "story": [
      "Even if you don't know the meaning of the Oxford University Press' word of the year for 2025, you've probably been a victim of it on social media.",
      "The publisher for the Oxford English Dictionary said on Monday it chose \"rage bait\" as its top word for the year, capturing the internet zeitgeist of 2025.",
      "The word of the year is selected by lexicographers at Oxford University Press who analyze new and emerging words, as well as changes in the way language is being used, to identify words of \"cultural significance.\"",
      "What is \"rage bait\"?",
      "The phrase refers to online content that is \"deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive,\" to drive traffic to a particular social media account, Oxford said in a statement.",
      "\"The person producing it will bask in the millions, quite often, of comments and shares and even likes sometimes,'' lexicographer Susie Dent told CBS News partner BBC. This is a result of the algorithms used by social media companies, \"because although we love fluffy cats, we'll appreciate that we tend to engage more with negative content and content that really provokes us.\"",
      "It is similar to clickbait, where a headline is used to lure a reader into viewing an article or a video, but rage bait content's specific focus is on making people angry.",
      "\"The fact that the word 'rage bait' exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, told BBC News. \"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"",
      "2025 Word of the Year shortlist",
      "Rage bait topped two other contenders \u2013 \"aura farming\" and \"biohack\" \u2013 after public comment on a shortlist compiled by the publisher's lexicographers.",
      "\"Aura farming'' means to cultivate a public image by presenting oneself in \"a way intended subtly to convey an air of confidence, coolness or mystique.''",
      "\"Biohack'' is defined as \"an attempt to improve or optimize one's physical or mental performance, health or longevity.''",
      "Oxford's past winners",
      "Oxford University Press has selected a word of the year annually since 2004.",
      "Past winners include \"podcast\" in 2005, \"emoji\" in 2015, and in 2022, \"goblin mode,\" which described people who resisted returning to normal life after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Last year's word, brain rot, captured the mental drain of mindless scrolling on Instagram or TikTok.",
      "Cambridge Dictionary declared \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year, defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "Dictionary.com named \"67\"\u00a0as its 2025 word of the year.",

    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",
      "A flurry of paintings by famous artists have sold at auctions in recent days.",
      "Last week, a previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million at a Paris auction.",
      "Also in November, a self-portrait by celebrated Mexican artist Frida Kahlo\u00a0sold for $54.66 million\u00a0in New York, a record for a painting by a woman. Two nights before that, a Gustav Klimt canvas\u00a0fetched $236.4 million\u00a0\u2014 a record for a modern art piece.",

At that time, authorities warned people against sleeping out in the open or moving around at night alone, but some houses in the area don't even have doors and many lack indoor toilets, so residents have little option but to go out to relieve themselves in the night.",

      "The majority of India's roughly 3,000 wolves survive outside protected areas, often in close proximity to people.",
      "The animals, also known as the plains wolf and listed as vulnerable, are smaller than the stronger Himalayan wolf and can be mistaken for other species such as jackals.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 21:14:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV is wrapping up his visit to Turkey before heading to Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV wrapped up his visit to Turkey on Sunday before heading to Lebanon, where he aimed to bring a message of hope to its long-suffering people and bolster a crucial Christian community in the Middle East. He preached similar messages of peace and unity, within his own Catholic community and more broadly, during his earlier stops in Turkey.",
      "Leo had two key appointments in Istanbul before flying to Beirut: a prayer at the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral and a divine liturgy with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, whose invitation to commemorate an important Christian anniversary was the impetus for Leo's visit.",
      "Leo processed into the Armenian cathedral in a cloud of incense as a choir chanted. He praised the \"courageous Christian witness of the Armenian people throughout history, often amid tragic circumstances.\" It was a reference to the World War I-era slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks.",
      "Pope Francis had termed the massacre a \"genocide,\" angering Turkey, which denies a genocide took place. Leo was more diplomatic in his words on Turkish soil.",
      "While in Turkey, the pope also visited Istanbul's\u00a0Blue Mosque, an Ottoman-era historical structure that has become a popular site for tourists.",
      "\"The Pope visited the Mosque in silence, in a spirit of reflection and listening, with profound respect for the place and the faith of those gathered there in prayer,\" said the Holy See's press office in a statement. He was accompanied by Turkish Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, the Provincial Mufti of Istanbul Emrullah Tuncel, and the Grand Imam of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque) Kurra Haf\u0131z Fatih Kaya.",
      "On the second leg of his maiden papal trip, Leo will visit Lebanon at a precarious moment for the small Mediterranean country after years of successive crises. He is fulfilling a promise of Pope Francis, who had wanted to visit for years, but was unable to as his health worsened.",
      "Francis often quoted St. John Paul II, who in 1989 said that Lebanon was more than just a country. It was a \"message\" \u2014 a message of fraternity and coexistence. Under Lebanon's power-sharing system, the country's president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the parliamentary speaker a Shiite.",
      "Lebanon, a Muslim-majority country where about a third of the population is Christian, has always been a priority for the Vatican, a bulwark for Christians throughout the region. After years of conflict, Christian communities that date from the time of the Apostles have shrunk.",
      "Leo was expected to try to encourage Lebanese who believe their leaders have failed them, and to encourage Lebanese Christians to stay or, if they have already moved abroad, to come home.",
      "\"The Holy Father is coming at a very difficult moment for Lebanon and for our region,\" said Bishop George, archbishop of the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Beirut. Lebanese are worried about the future, he said, and still fear a possible return to all-out war with Israel.",
      "\"In this difficult moment, the pope's visit is a sign of hope. It shows that Lebanon is not forgotten,\" he told reportersbefore the visit.",
      "In 2019, the country's currency and banking system collapsed and many Lebanese saw their savings evaporate. The financial crisis drove shortages of electricity, fuel and medicine.",
      "Another disaster followed in 2020, when hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate improperly stored at the Beirut port detonated in an explosion that blasted through the surrounding neighborhoods, killing 218 people, wounding thousands more and causing billions of dollars in damage.",
      "The highlight of Leo's Lebanese visit will come on his last day, Dec. 2, when he spends time in silent prayer at the site of the blast on Aug. 4, 2020, and meets with some of its victims.",
      "Lebanese citizens were enraged by the blast, which appeared to be the result of government negligence, coming on top of the economic crisis. But an investigation has repeatedly stalled, and five years on, no official has been convicted.",
      "There are hopes among Lebanese that Leo will demand accountability from Lebanon's political class and insist that there can be no peace without truth and justice.",
      "Another important moment will come when Leo meets with young Lebanese. He's expected to give them words of encouragement, amid the decades-long flight abroad, while also acknowledging their disillusionment over the failures of generations before them.",
      "After the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah entered into a low-level conflict with Israel that escalated into a full-fledged war in September 2024, killing more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and causing widespread destruction.",
      "Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that nominally ended the conflict two months later, Israel continues to launch near-daily airstrikes that it says aim to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding.",
      "The pope \"is coming to bless us and for the sake of peace,\" said Farah Saadeh, a Beirut resident walking on the city's seaside promenade. \"We have to wait and see what will happen after he leaves, and we hope nothing is going to happen after his departure.\"",
      "Before Leo's arrival, Hezbollah urged the pope to express his \"rejection to injustice and aggression\" that the country is being subjected to. It was a reference to the Israeli strikes. The group also urged its supporters to line up along the road the papal convoy will take from the airport to the presidential palace to pay their respects.",
      "Hezbollah \u2014 a primarily Shiite group \u2014 has allied with several Christian political groups in the country, including the Free Patriotic Movement and Marada Movement.",
      "However, the Christian party with the largest parliamentary bloc, the Lebanese Forces, is an opponent of Hezbollah and has criticized the group for pulling the country into a war with Israel.",
      "In neighboring Syria, hundreds of thousands of Christians fled during the country's 14 years of civil war.",
      "The country's former autocratic President Bashar Assad was ousted in an offensive led by Islamist insurgents last December. Since then, there have been outbreaks of sectarian violence and some attacks on religious minorities, including a suicide attack on a church in Damascus in June.",
      "While the new government has condemned attacks on minorities, many accuse it of looking the other way or being unable to control allied armed groups.",
      "A delegation of some 300 Syrian Christians, headed by a Greek Melkite Catholic priest, was set to travel to Lebanon to join a meeting between Leo and youth groups and pray in a public mass on Beirut's waterfront.",
      "\"We are in need of someone like the pope to come and give us hope as Christians\" at a time of \"fear of an unknown future,\" said 24-year-old Dima Awwad, one of the delegation members. \"We wish that the pope would come to visit Syria as he visited Lebanon, to reassure the people and to feel that we are present as eastern Christians and that we need to be in this place.\"",

      "NANCY CORDES: We turn now to the fight against hunger in the United States. According to government data, 47.4 million people lived in what the Department of Agriculture calls a food insecure household in 2023. That's when a household can't necessarily obtain enough food to feed all of its members. One of the largest groups working to combat food insecurity is Feeding America, and we're joined now by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is in Charleston, South Carolina this morning. Claire, thanks so much for being with us, and happy Thanksgiving.",
      "CLAIRE BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Thanks for having me back.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Absolutely. So during the shutdown, we saw these incredibly long lines at food banks. The shutdown has now been over for a couple of weeks. SNAP benefits are going out again, but even before the shutdown, food insecurity was at its highest rate in nearly a decade. So, what is the situation now that you're seeing at food banks around the country as we head into the holidays?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah. So I'm so glad that you- you made that point. I- I think your viewers may be surprised to learn that food insecurity rates before the shutdown were higher than at any point during the pandemic, as an example. We're continuing to see very high demand. I think part of the reason is because the fastest growing group of people turning to the charitable food system, they're people who don't even qualify for any federal nutrition programs so this is an area that we've got to stay focused on. We know the kinds of things that work. We need to do those things so that we can really address what's happening with hunger and poverty in the country,",
      "NANCY CORDES: What do you think is contributing to the rise in hunger and this group of people who, as you say, don't qualify for benefits, but are showing an increased need for food?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: Yeah, I think it's that the system is broken. Right now, there's so many people, if you can imagine, in this country who can't afford to get a raise at work, because we have a system that does not incentivize people to continue to move up the ladder. We've got ladders with big missing rungs, if you will, so we can do something about that. We could have a sliding scale, for instance, that allows people to move out of poverty. By doing that, because food insecurity is actually a symptom of poverty, they'll move out of that as well. We as a nation should all want people to be able to provide for themselves. We should all want them to be able to get work that they can feel proud of and support their families with. We have the power to do all of those things, it will require that we work together, that we be honest about what's broken, and that we really get committed about fixing those things.",
      "NANCY CORDES: What are the main challenges that the organizations in your network are facing this holiday season as they try to feed people who are hungry? Is the food there for the people who need it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: \u00a0Yeah, unfortunately, the lines are longer than- than the food that is available, and one of the hardest things to witness will be seeing these people who have the same dreams, aspirations for their kids and themselves, as I have for mine and all of your viewers have for theirs, feeling the need to turn to the charitable food system. It takes a lot of courage and resiliency and commitment to family ofttimes to be able to do that, and then for them to turn up in spite of all of those barriers, and not- us not be able to provide them with what they really need so I have a deep respect for people experiencing hunger in this country. I've been a person who's experienced hunger before. I know many people who have, many people who still do, so many of them are my heroes. And then another set of heroes that I have are people working in this fight in the Feeding America network, who show up shoulder to shoulder with people experiencing hunger, who are so deeply committed to their well being. So we need to position people experiencing hunger to be able to fend for themselves, and we need to position food banks to be able to provide them with the support that they need in this moment, until they get there.",
      "NANCY CORDES: As you know, there are about two million Americans who are going to be affected by changes to the SNAP program that were made earlier this year in a vote by Congress. They will not be receiving SNAP benefits any longer. What are the economic implications of that? And in about 30 seconds, what can your organizations do about it?",
      "BABINEAUX-FONTENOT: According to the Congressional Budget Office, we're probably looking at about a six billion meal per year gap that's going to be created. So the kinds of things that we ought to do: we ought to address fraud where it exists. We ought to incentivize people to be able to get the hand up that they need and to move out of poverty. We ought to address error rates, but we ought to do all of these things strategically, and we ought to do them in a bipartisan way. This ought to be the kind of thing that this country can come together around, that we can hold hands shoulder to shoulder, because when people experiencing hunger win, we all do.",
      "NANCY CORDES: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, we have to leave it there. We've got a hard out. But thank you so much, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot from Feeding America. Thank you so much.",

    "summary": "The \"Zero Units\" were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among Afghanistan's most trusted domestic forces.",
    "story": [
      "An image of an ID badge circulating widely online that shows the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members says he was assigned to the \"Kandahar Strike Force\" or \"03\" unit, one of a number of so-called \"Zero Units\" that worked closely with U.S. and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan. A former senior Afghan military source confirmed to CBS News that the ID badge is authentic.",
      "A U.S. official briefed on the shooting investigation and a former senior Afghan National Defense and Security Forces member told CBS News that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been part of a \"Zero Unit,\" an Afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA. The units were exclusively composed of\u00a0Afghan nationals\u00a0and operated under the umbrella of the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, the intelligence agency established with CIA backing for Afghanistan's previous, U.S.-backed government. They were considered by the U.S. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in Afghanistan.",
      "Those units are often labeled \"death squads\" by human rights groups. The units were known in Afghanistan for their secrecy and alleged brutality, and members were implicated in numerous extrajudicial killings of civilians, particularly during night raids.",
      "The U.S. official briefed on the investigation confirmed the suspect had been disturbed by the casualties in this unit and, more recently, deeply troubled by the killing of his close friend overseas.",
      "The image of the ID badge also carries the words \"Firebase Gecko,\" which was the name of a base used by the CIA and special forces in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, inside what was previously the compound of the Taliban's founding leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Thursday the suspect had previously worked \"with the U.S. Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Sami Sadat, a former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, told CBS News that Lakanwal worked for the \"03\" unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the U.S.-backed government told CBS News on Thursday that \"03 unit, also known as The Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), was under special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.\" Lakanwal was part of the unit's operations team, Sadat said.",
      "\"He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,\" Sadat said.",
      "\"While we could not establish any connection between him and any terrorist organization, we also cannot completely rule it out,\" Sadat said. \"However, we can confirm that his background does not show any links to terrorists.\"",
      "Lakanwal's family faced serious threats from the Taliban, which led him to relocate them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the U.S., Sadat said Lakanwal was \"generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.\"",
      "As a member of a Zero Unit, the suspect would have been virtually guaranteed a route to asylum in the U.S. because members of these elite units were high on the list for\u00a0Taliban retaliation\u00a0after the group retook control of the country. Many members of these units played key roles in the August 2021\u00a0evacuation from Kabul, in return for a guarantee of space on a flight for themselves and their families out of Afghanistan.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under the Obama administration, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Afghan evacuees were thoroughly vetted prior to arriving in the U.S. after its withdrawal.",
      "In Lakanwal's case, the suspect would have been vetted by the CIA prior to joining the Zero Unit, Vinograd said, before referencing comments from national security leaders that suggested he became radicalized after coming to the U.S.",
      "\"This horrific tragedy could be the result of an individual that quickly mobilized to violence without any ties to foreign terrorism,\" said Vinograd. \"And, as we have discussed in other cases, trying to find lone actors before they initiate an attack is harder than trying to find a needle in a haystack.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Afghanistan's current Taliban government, and officials in Kabul did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment on the arrest in Washington.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 08:30:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous changes in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday asked the country's president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges \u2014 seeking to end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.",
      "Netanyahu, who has been battling the country's legal system over the charges, said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous changes in the region. But it immediately triggered denunciations from his opponents, who said it would weaken Israel's democratic institutions and send a dangerous message that he is above the rule of law.",
      "In a statement Sunday the prime minister's office said that Netanyahu had submitted a request for a pardon to the legal department of the Office of the President. The president's office called it an \"extraordinary request,\" carrying with it \"significant implications.\"",
      "\"After receiving all of the relevant opinions, the President will responsibly and sincerely consider the request,\" said the office of Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, in a statement.",
      "Netanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters. He has not yet been convicted of anything.",
      "Netanyahu rejects the allegations, and has condemned the case as a witch hunt orchestrated by the media, police and judiciary.",
      "The request comes weeks after U.S. President Trump urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu. Earlier this month Mr. Trump also sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case \"political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu said the trial has divided the country and that a pardon would help restore national unity. He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead the country.",
      "\"The continuation of the trial tears us apart from within, stirs up this division, and deepens rifts. I am sure, like many others in the nation, that an immediate conclusion of the trial would greatly help to lower the flames and promote the broad reconciliation that our country so desperately needs,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu has taken the stand multiple times over the past year, but the case has been repeatedly delayed as he has dealt with wars and unrest stemming from the Hamas-led militant attacks of October 2023.",
      "Netanyahu's pardon request consisted of two documents \u2014 a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by Netanyahu. They'll be sent to the justice ministry for opinions and will then be transferred to the Legal Advisor in the Office of the President, which will formulate additional opinions for the president.",
      "Many legal experts say the pardon request is not able to stop the trial.",
      "\"It's impossible,\" said Emi Palmor, former director general of the justice ministry.",
      "\"You cannot claim that you're innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene,\" she said. The only way to stop the trial is to ask the attorney general to withhold the proceedings, she said.",
      "Netanyahu's request sparked an immediate response from the opposition, which urged the president not to give in to his request.",
      "\"You cannot grant him a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life,\" said opposition leader Yair Lapid.",

    "summary": "Preliminary investigations showed the fire started Wednesday afternoon on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings, and then spread rapidly inside as the foam panels caught fire and blew out windows.",
    "story": [
      "The death toll in Hong Kong's apartment complex blaze rose to 146 on Sunday as investigators discovered more bodies in the burned-out buildings. A steady stream of people placed bouquets of flowers at an ever-growing makeshift memorial at the scene of the disaster, among the worst in the city's history.",
      "The Hong Kong police Disaster Victim Identification Unit has been going through the buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex meticulously and has found bodies both in apartment units and on the roofs, said the officer in charge, Cheng Ka-chun.",
      "The buildings remain structurally sound, but the search has been slow, he told reporters, still wearing his white coveralls with his hard hat and respiratory mask at his side. \"It is so dark inside, and because of the low light, it is very difficult to do the work, especially in places away from the windows.\"",
      "So far the team has examined four of the seven blocks, Cheng said.",
      "The latest searches turned up another 30 bodies, including 12 that had already been discovered by firefighters but hadn't been recovered, said Tsang Shuk-yin, the head of the Hong Kong police casualty unit.",
      "Another 100 people are unaccounted for and 79 have been injured, Tsang said.",
      "At the scene, well-wishers bowed and said short prayers, or left handwritten notes among the flowers.",
      "\"This really serves as a wake-up call for everyone, especially with these super high-rise buildings,\" said Lian Shuzheng, who waited in a line of hundreds of people to add her flowers to the growing cluster.",
      "People have also donated supplies to those who lost everything in the blaze, which started Wednesday and took until Friday to fully extinguish.",
      "The eight buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex in the suburb of Tai Po had all been clad in bamboo scaffolding draped with nylon netting for renovations, with windows covered by polystyrene panels. Authorities were investigating whether fire codes were violated.",
      "Other constructions by the same builder are halted",
      "Hong Kong officials announced late Saturday they had ordered the immediate suspension of work on 28 building projects undertaken by the same contractor, the Prestige Construction & Engineering Company, for safety audits.",
      "\"The five alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po, exposed serious deficiencies of PC&E in site safety management, including the extensive use of foam boards to block up windows during building repairs,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "The company did not answer calls Sunday for comment.",
      "Three men \u2014 the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company \u2014 were arrested the day after the fire broke out on suspicion of manslaughter, and police said company leaders were suspected of gross negligence. Police did not identify the firm by name.",
      "Those three were released on bail but then rearrested by Hong Kong's anti-corruption authorities, who have also arrested a further eight suspects including scaffolding subcontractors, directors of an engineering consulting company and the renovation project managers.",
      "Faulty fire alarms and foam panels under investigation",
      "The apartment complex of eight, 31-story buildings in Tai Po, a suburb near Hong Kong's border with mainland China, was built in the 1980s. It had almost 2,000 apartments and more than 4,600 residents.",
      "Many are now housed in short-term emergency shelters or city hotels, and authorities are working on longer-term solutions.",
      "\"It's heartbreaking,\" said Jeffery Chan, a civil servant who came to pay his respects on Sunday.",
      "\"As a Hong Konger, seeing people in the place where we live lose their families, lose everything in just one night \u2014 if you put yourself in their shoes, it is unbearable. They need encouragement, support and help from the people of Hong Kong,\" he said.",
      "Preliminary investigations showed the fire started Wednesday afternoon on a lower-level scaffolding net of one of the buildings, and then spread rapidly inside as the foam panels caught fire and blew out windows, according to Chris Tang, Hong Kong's secretary for security. Winds helped the flames jump from building to building and soon seven of the eight were engulfed.",
      "First responders found that some fire alarms in the complex, which housed many older people, did not sound when tested, according to Andy Yeung, the director of Hong Kong Fire Services.",
      "The dead included seven Indonesian migrant workers, and several dozen are still unaccounted for, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said. One Filipina domestic helper was also killed and 12 others remain unaccounted for, according to the Philippines Consulate General in Hong Kong.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, several hundred Filipinos packed a pedestrian street in central Hong Kong, saying prayers and singing hymns in tribute to the fire victims.",
      "In Beijing, the Ministry of Emergency Management announced a nationwide inspection of high-rise buildings to identify and remove fire hazards.",
      "\"Bamboo scaffolding, non-flame-retardant safety nets... and firefighting facilities and equipment such as fire hydrant systems, automatic sprinkler systems and automatic fire alarm systems, will be among the main items to be inspected,\" the ministry said.",
      "The Wang Fuk Court fire is the worst on record since a warehouse blaze in 1948 killed 176 people.",

      "Even light activity helps the stomach process food and reduces the pressure that leads to heartburn. No matter how appealing it may seem, Shachner recommends avoiding the post-feast nap.",
      "4. Not knowing your triggers",
      "Some foods and drinks are more likely to cause trouble. Common triggers include fatty or fried dishes, tomato sauces, citrus, chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, coffee and carbonated drinks, according to the doctor.",

      "An occasional bout of heartburn isn\u2019t usually cause for concern, but if you\u2019re having symptoms two or more times a week, or if over-the-counter remedies stop working, the doctor said it's important to pay attention.",

      "Senior Trump officials reiterated in recent days their plans to explore \"all options\" to proceed with criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey after a judge last week dismissed his case on the grounds that the interim U.S. attorney tasked with prosecuting the case had been unlawfully appointed.",

      "Here's what we know about the dismissal of Comey's criminal case and what obstacles the Trump administration might face in efforts to revive it.",
      "Comey was indicted in September on one count of allegedly lying to Congress during testimony before a Senate subcommittee in 2020 and one count of obstruction stemming from the same event.",
      "Trump announced days earlier that Lindsey Halligan would be heading up the Eastern District of Virginia to replace interim U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert. Siebert resigned under pressure to indict Comey and James, as Fox News and other outlets previously reported.",
      "Comey's lawyers quickly filed two motions to dismiss his criminal case, including on the grounds that Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney and former White House aide who presented the case to a grand jury, was unlawfully appointed.",
      "That question was reviewed by U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie, an outside district judge who ultimately sided with Comey's lawyers on the matter.",
      "\"Because Ms. Halligan had no lawful authority to present the indictment, I will grant Mr. Comey\u2019s motion and dismiss the indictment,\" Currie said.",

      "The Trump administration is free to seek to appeal Currie's dismissals to the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and Bondi vowed to do so \"immediately\" last week at a conference in Memphis.",
      "Currie dismissed Comey's case and James' case \"without prejudice\" \u2014 a detail that could leave the door open for the government to secure new indictments, should it choose to do so.",
      "But any attempts to bring new charges against either Comey or James would be held up further by appellate court review. It is unclear how long that process could take and many court watchers have declined to speculate on the process, given the many uncertainties that remain at play.",
      "Comey's case in particular has raised unique and potentially tricky questions for the Justice Department.",
      "Comey was charged with making false statements to Congress and for obstruction related to his testimony in September 2020. Both charges had a five-year statute of limitations that expired Sept. 30 \u2014 just three days after Bondi installed Halligan at the U.S. Attorney's Office.",
      "It is unclear whether the judge's order \"resets the clock\" on the statute of limitations under a federal law, as Trump's allies have argued it should. The statute would give the Trump administration six additional months from the date of Currie's dismissal to re-indict Comey.",
      "Under the same law, a dismissal by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals would trigger a 60-day window for the Trump administration to re-indict Comey.",
      "Currie's ruling addresses just one of two major issues that Comey's lawyers cited in their effort to toss his criminal case, however \u2014 and any attempt to revive the case or reverse the dismissal is widely expected to be featured heavily into the second motion to dismiss.",

      "Comey's lawyers filed not one, but two motions to dismiss his criminal case. The second filing seeks to do so as a result of what Comey's lawyers argued is \"vindictive\" and selective prosecution by the Justice Department.",
      "\"President Trump ordered the Department of Justice to prosecute Mr. Comey because of personal spite and because Mr. Comey has frequently criticized the president for his conduct in office,\" Comey's lawyers, Patrick Fitzgerald and Jessica Carmichael, said in the motion to dismiss, filed in late October.",
      "The motion ticks through the years-long, strained relationship between Trump and his onetime FBI director, which Comey's lawyers said bolsters their claim that the indictment \"arises from multiple glaring constitutional violations and an egregious abuse of power by the federal government.\"",
      "Unlike the motion to dismiss the case based on the unlawfulness of Halligan's appointment, which was reviewed by an outside judge, Comey's motion to dismiss\u00a0was slated to be heard by U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, the district judge assigned to Comey's case.",
      "It would be expected to come into play immediately, should an appeals court reverse Currie's ruling, since the motions to dismiss must be reviewed by a court before the start of a criminal trial.",
      "It would also almost certainly involve witness testimony from Trump officials with knowledge of the case to speak to what steps the administration took in the run-up to Comey's indictment, the timing of the charges brought against him and who in the administration ordered certain actions.",

      "Lawyers for Comey asked Nachmanoff to dismiss the case with prejudice \u2014 an outcome that, if granted, would block the government from seeking to re-indict Comey for the same actions.",
      "Still, it is notoriously difficult to have a case tossed on the grounds of selective or vindictive prosecution, and in order to do so, Comey's legal team must prove to the court both that prosecutors were acting with genuine animus in bringing the case against him \u2014 and that prosecutors singled him out because of that animus.",
      "Still, his lawyers presented an abundance of evidence in their filing that they argued satisfies that burden, and which primarily includes statements and admissions made by Trump and by senior administration officials.",
      "\"Objective evidence establishes that President Trump directed the prosecution of Mr. Comey in retaliation for Mr. Comey\u2019s public criticisms and to punish Mr. Comey because of personal spite,\" his lawyers said.",
      "Short of outright dismissal, the next steps would be expected to involve additional discovery and an evidentiary hearing.",
      "In the meantime, Bondi told reporters that Halligan will remain in her post at the U.S. Attorney's Office.",
      "As of this writing, neither the Trump administration nor Comey's lawyers seem to think the case is mooted.",
      "Comey's lawyers vowed to continue the fight after his case was dismissed: \"We will continue to challenge any further politically motivated charges through every lawful means available,\" Comey's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement last week.",
      "And Comey himself also weighed in on the matter in a video posted last week to social media.",
      "Trump \"will probably come after me again, and my attitude\u2019s going to be the same,\" Comey said, shortly after his case was dismissed. \"I\u2019m innocent. I am not afraid. And I believe in an independent federal judiciary.\"",
      "Senior Trump administration officials have said much of the same.",
      "\"This will not be the final word on this matter,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said last week.",

      "Moret first received a flood of alerts. These included two-factor authentication notifications that claimed someone was trying to access his iCloud account. Within minutes, he got phone calls from calm, helpful callers who claimed to be Apple agents ready to fix the issue.",
      "The twist is how convincing the entire setup felt. The scammers were able to exploit a flaw in Apple's Support system that lets anyone create a genuine support ticket without verification. They opened a real Apple Support case in his name, which triggered official emails from an Apple domain. This built instant trust and lowered Moret's guard.",
      "How scammers gained access to the account",
      "During a 25-minute call, the fake agents guided Moret through what they said would secure his account. They walked him through the steps to reset his iCloud password. They also told him a link would follow so he could close the case.",
      "That link took him to a fake site called appeal apple dot com. The page looked official and claimed his account was being secured. It then told him to enter a six-digit code sent by text to finish the process.",
      "When Moret entered that code, the scammers got exactly what they needed to sign into his account.",
      "He then got an alert that his Apple ID had been used to sign into a Mac mini he did not own. That confirmed the takeover attempt. Even though the scammer on the phone said this was normal, he trusted his instinct. He reset his password again, which kicked them out and stopped the attack.",

      "Scammers created a real-looking ticket to make the entire experience seem legitimate. You can confirm what's real by checking directly with Apple. Sign in at appleid.apple.com or open the Apple Support app to view your recent cases. If the case number isn't listed there, the message is fake, even if the email comes from an Apple domain.",
      "Never stay on a call that you did not initiate. Scammers rely on long conversations to build trust and pressure you into quick decisions. Hang up right away and call Apple Support directly at 1-800-275-2273 or through the Support app. A real agent will quickly confirm whether anything is wrong.",
      "If something feels off, look at the devices signed into your account. Go to\u00a0Settings, tap your\u00a0name and scroll to see all devices\u00a0linked to your Apple ID. Remove anything you don't recognize. This step can stop attackers fast if they've managed to get in.",
      "No real support agent will ever ask for your two-factor authentication codes. Treat any request for these codes as a major warning.",

      "FoloToy posted a detailed statement on X that laid out its version of what happened. In the post, the company said it viewed child safety as its\u00a0\"highest priority\" and that it was\u00a0\"the only company to proactively suspend sales, not only of the product mentioned in the report, but also of our other AI toys.\" FoloToy said it took this action \"immediately after the findings were published because we believe responsible action must come before commercial considerations.\"",

      "The data includes old passwords from\u00a0past breaches and fresh passwords stolen by info-stealing malware on infected devices. Synthient partnered with security researcher Troy Hunt, who runs Have I Been Pwned. He verified the dataset and confirmed that it contains new exposures.",
      "To test the data, Hunt started with one of his old email addresses. He already knew it had been added to past credential stuffing lists. When he found it in the new trove, he reached out to trusted Have I Been Pwned users to confirm the findings. Some had never appeared in breaches before, which proved that this leak includes new stolen logins.",

      "These simple actions strengthen your accounts fast and help you stay ahead of criminals who rely on stolen passwords.",
      "Do not leave a known leaked password in place. Change it right away on every site where you used it. Create a new login that is strong, unique and not similar to your old one. This step cuts off criminals who already have your stolen credentials.",
      "Avoid reusing passwords across sites. Once hackers get a working email and password pair, they try it on other services. This attack method, called credential stuffing, still succeeds because many people recycle the same login. One stolen password should not unlock every account you own.",
      "A strong password manager can generate new secure logins for your accounts. It creates long, complex passwords that you do not have to memorize. It also stores them safely so you can sign in quickly without taking risky shortcuts. Many password managers also scan for breaches to see if your current passwords have been exposed.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "If you want better protection, start using\u00a0passkeys on services that support them. Passkeys use cryptographic keys instead of text passwords. Criminals cannot guess or reuse them. They also stop many phishing attacks because they only work on trusted sites. Think of passkeys as a secure digital lock for your most important accounts.",
      "Data brokers collect and sell your personal details, which criminals can combine with stolen passwords. A trusted data removal service can help find and remove your information from people-search sites. Reducing your exposed data makes it harder for attackers to target you with convincing scams and account takeovers.",
      "While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you.

    "story": [
      "FOX Business correspondent Darren Botelho reports on growing concerns about the misuse of artificial intelligence after a major U.S. company, Anthropic, detected a cyberattack using AI by Chinese-sponsored hackers.",
      "Cybersecurity has been reshaped by the rapid rise of advanced artificial intelligence tools, and recent incidents show just how quickly the threat landscape is shifting.",
      "Over the past year, we've seen a surge in attacks powered by AI models that can write code, scan networks and automate complex tasks. This capability has helped defenders, but it has also enabled attackers to move faster than before.",
      "The latest example is a major cyberespionage campaign conducted by a Chinese state-linked group that used Anthropic's Claude to carry out large parts of an attack with very little human involvement.",
      "HACKER EXPLOITS AI CHATBOT IN CYBERCRIME SPREE",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "How Chinese hackers turned Claude into an automated attack machine",
      "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic investigators spotted unusual behavior that eventually revealed a coordinated and well-resourced campaign. The threat actor, assessed with high confidence as a Chinese state-sponsored group, had used Claude Code to target roughly 30 organizations worldwide. The list included major tech firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government bodies. A small number of those attempts resulted in successful breaches.",
      "Claude handled most of the operation autonomously, triggering thousands of requests and generating detailed documentation of the attack for future use. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "This was not a typical intrusion. The attackers built a framework that let Claude act as an autonomous operator. Instead of asking the model to help, they tasked it with executing most of the attack. Claude inspected systems, mapped out internal infrastructure and flagged databases worth targeting. The speed was unlike anything a human team could replicate.",
      "To get around Claude's safety rules, the attackers broke their plan into tiny, innocent-looking steps. They also told the model it was part of a legitimate cybersecurity team performing defensive testing. Anthropic later noted that the attackers didn't simply hand tasks to Claude; they engineered the operation to make the model believe it was performing authorized pentesting work, splitting the attack into harmless-looking pieces and using multiple jailbreak techniques to push past its safeguards. Once inside, Claude researched vulnerabilities, wrote custom exploits, harvested credentials and expanded access. It worked through these steps with little supervision and reported back only when it needed human approval for major decisions.",
      "The model also handled the data extraction. It collected sensitive information, sorted it by value and identified high-privilege accounts. It even created backdoors for future use. In the final stage, Claude generated detailed documentation of what it had done. This included stolen credentials, systems analyzed and notes that could guide future operations.",
      "Across the entire campaign, investigators estimate that Claude performed around 80-90% of the work. Human operators stepped in only a handful of times. At its peak, the AI triggered thousands of requests, often multiple per second, a pace still far beyond what any human team could achieve. Although it occasionally hallucinated credentials or misread public data as secret, those errors underscored that fully autonomous cyberattacks still face limitations, even when an AI model handles the majority of the work.",
      "Why this AI-powered Claude attack is a turning point for cybersecurity",
      "This campaign shows how much the barrier to high-end cyberattacks has dropped. A group with far fewer resources could now attempt something similar by leaning on an autonomous AI agent to do the heavy lifting. Tasks that once required years of expertise can now be automated by a model that understands context, writes code and uses external tools without direct oversight.",
      "Earlier incidents documented AI misuse, but humans were still steering every step. This case is different. The attackers needed very little involvement once the system was in motion. And while the investigation focused on usage within Claude, researchers believe similar activity is happening across other advanced models, which might include Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Musk's Grok.",
      "This raises a difficult question. If these systems can be misused so easily, why continue building them? According to researchers, the same capabilities that make AI dangerous are also what make it essential for defense. During this incident, Anthropic's own team used Claude to analyze the flood of logs, signals and data its investigation uncovered. That level of support will matter even more as threats grow.",
      "We reached out to Anthropic for comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "You may not be the direct target of a state-sponsored campaign, but many of the same techniques trickle down to everyday scams, credential theft and account takeovers. Here are seven detailed steps you can take to stay safer.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for known malware. It looks for suspicious patterns, blocked connections and abnormal system behavior. This is important because AI-driven attacks can generate new code quickly, which means traditional signature-based detection is no longer enough.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A good password manager helps you create long, random passwords for every service you use. This matters because AI can generate and test password variations at high speed. Using the same password across accounts can turn a single leak into a full compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "A large part of modern cyberattacks begins with publicly available information. Attackers often gather email addresses, phone numbers, old passwords and personal details from data broker sites. AI tools make this even easier, since they can scrape and analyze huge datasets in seconds. A personal data removal service helps clear your information from these broker sites so you are harder to profile or target.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Strong passwords alone are not enough when attackers can steal credentials through malware, phishing pages or automated scripts. Two-factor authentication adds a serious roadblock. Use app-based codes or hardware keys instead of SMS. While no method is perfect, this extra layer often stops unauthorized logins even when attackers have your password.",
      "Attackers rely heavily on known vulnerabilities that people forget or ignore. System updates patch these flaws and close off entry points that attackers use to break in. Enable automatic updates on your phone, laptop, router and the apps you use most. If an update looks optional, treat it as important anyway, because many companies downplay security fixes in their release notes.",
      "Malicious apps are one of the easiest ways attackers get inside your device. Stick to official app stores and avoid APK sites, shady download portals and random links shared on messaging apps. Even on official stores, check reviews, download counts and the developer name before installing anything. Grant the minimum permissions required and avoid apps that ask for full access for no clear reason.",
      "AI tools have made phishing more convincing. Attackers can generate clean messages, imitate writing styles and craft perfect fake websites that match the real ones. Slow down when a message feels urgent or unexpected. Never click links from unknown senders, and verify requests from known contacts through a separate channel. If a pop-up claims your device is infected or your bank account is locked, close it and check directly through the official website.",
      "By breaking tasks into small, harmless-looking steps, the threat actors tricked Claude into writing exploits, harvesting credentials and expanding access.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The attack carried out through Claude signals a major shift in how cyber threats will evolve. Autonomous AI agents can already perform complex tasks at speeds no human team can match, and this gap will only widen as models improve. Security teams now need to treat AI as a core part of their defensive toolkit, not a future add-on. Better threat detection, stronger safeguards and more sharing across the industry are going to be crucial. Because if attackers are already using AI at this scale, the window to prepare is shrinking fast.",

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Update your phone, computer browsers and apps on a regular schedule. These updates patch security gaps that criminals try to exploit. When you fall behind on updates, weak passwords become even riskier because attackers can pair old software flaws with easy logins.",
      "Leaked passwords often come from old profiles on data broker sites you forgot about. A data removal service can wipe your personal info from those sites and reduce how much of your data ends up on breach lists. When less of your information is floating around online, your accounts become less tempting targets.",

    "story": [
      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "Android users have been dealing with a steady rise in financial malware for years. Threats like Hydra, Anatsa and Octo have shown how attackers can take over a phone, read everything on the screen and drain accounts before you even notice anything wrong. Security updates have helped slow some of these strains, but malware authors keep adapting with new tricks.",
      "The latest variant spotted in circulation is one of the most capable yet. It can silence your phone, take screenshots of banking apps, read clipboard entries, and even automate crypto wallet transactions. This threat is now known as Android BankBot YNRK, and it is far more advanced than typical mobile malware.",

      "How the malware infiltrates devices",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "Android banking malware is getting harder to spot as attackers use new tricks to take over phones and drain accounts. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "BankBot YNRK hides inside fake Android apps that appear legitimate when installed. In the samples analyzed by researchers at Cyfirma, the attackers used apps that impersonated official digital ID tools. Once installed, the malware begins profiling the device by collecting details such as brand, model and installed apps. It checks whether the device is an emulator to avoid automated security analysis. It also maps known models to screen resolutions, which helps it tailor its behavior to specific phones.",
      "To blend in, the malware can disguise itself as Google News. It does this by changing its app name and icon, then loading the real news.google.com site inside a WebView. While the victim believes the app is genuine, the malware quietly runs its background services.",
      "One of its first actions is to mute audio and notification alerts. This prevents victims from hearing incoming messages, alarms or calls that could signal unusual account activity. It then requests access to Accessibility Services. If granted, this allows the malware to interact with the device interface just like a user. From that point onward, it can press buttons, scroll through screens and read everything displayed on the device.",
      "BankBot YNRK also adds itself as a Device Administrator app. This makes it harder to remove and helps it restart itself after a reboot. To maintain long-term access, it schedules recurring background jobs that relaunch the malware every few seconds as long as the phone is connected to the internet.",
      "What does the malware steal",
      "Once the malware receives commands from its remote server, it gains near-complete control of the phone. It sends device information and installed app lists to the attackers, then receives a list of financial apps it should target. This list includes major banking apps used in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, along with several global cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "With Accessibility permissions enabled, the malware can read everything shown on the screen. It captures UI metadata such as text, view IDs and button positions. This helps it reconstruct a simplified version of any app's interface. Using this data, it can enter login details, swipe through menus or confirm transfers. It can also set text inside fields, install or remove apps, take photos, send SMS, turn call forwarding on and open banking apps in the background while the screen appears inactive.",
      "In cryptocurrency wallets, the malware acts like an automated bot. It can open apps such as Exodus or MetaMask, read balances and seed phrases, dismiss biometric prompts, and carry out transactions. Because all actions happen through Accessibility, the attacker never needs your passwords or PINs. Anything visible on the screen is enough.",
      "The malware also monitors the clipboard, so if users copy OTPs, account numbers or crypto keys, the data is immediately sent to the attackers. With call forwarding enabled, incoming bank verification calls can be silently redirected. All of these actions happen within seconds of the malware activating.",

It checks apps as you install them, alerts you to risky permissions and blocks known malware threats. Many top antivirus options also scan links and messages for danger, which adds an important layer of protection when scams move fast.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Avoid downloading APKs from random websites, forwarded messages or social media posts. Most banking malware spreads through sideloaded apps that look official but contain hidden code. The Play Store is not perfect, but it offers scanning, app verification and regular take-downs that greatly reduce the risk of installing infected apps.",
      "System updates often patch security issues that attackers exploit to bypass protections. Updating your apps is just as important, since outdated versions may contain weaknesses. Turn on automatic updates so that your device stays protected without you having to check manually.",
      "A password manager helps you create long, unique passwords for every account. It also saves you from typing passwords directly into apps, which reduces the chance of malware capturing them from your clipboard or keystrokes. If one password gets exposed, the rest of your accounts remain safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "2FA adds a confirmation step through an OTP, authenticator app or hardware key. Even if attackers steal your login details, they still need this second step to get in. It cannot stop malware that takes over your device, but it significantly limits how far an attacker can go with stolen credentials.",
      "GOOGLE ISSUES WARNING ON FAKE VPN APPS",
      "Malware often abuses permissions such as Accessibility or Device Admin because they allow deep control over your phone. Check your settings to see which apps have these permissions and remove anything that looks unfamiliar. Also, look through your installed apps and uninstall any tool or service you do not remember adding. Regular reviews help you spot threats early before they can steal data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "BankBot YNRK is one of the most capable Android banking threats discovered recently. It combines device profiling, strong persistence, UI automation and data theft to gain full control over a victim's financial apps. Because much of its activity relies on Accessibility permissions, a single tap from the user can give attackers complete access. Staying safe means avoiding unofficial APKs, reviewing installed apps regularly and being cautious of any sudden request to enable special permissions.",

      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "A U.S. neurotechnology startup called Paradromics is gaining momentum in the fast-growing field of brain-computer interfaces. The FDA has approved its first human trial built to test whether its fully implantable device can restore speech for people with paralysis. This milestone gives the Austin company a strong position in a competitive space, shaping the future of neural technology.",
      "Paradromics received Investigational Device Exemption status for the Connect-One Early Feasibility Study using its Connexus BCI. It is the first approved study to explore speech restoration with a fully implantable system. The research team wants to evaluate safety and see how well the device converts neural activity into text or a synthesized voice.",

      "BRAIN IMPLANT TURNS THOUGHTS INTO DIGITAL COMMANDS",
      "How the brain implant works",
      "The implant uses hundreds of tiny electrodes to capture detailed signals from the motor cortex where the brain forms sounds and shapes words. (Paradromics)",
      "Paradromics developed a fully implantable speech-focused brain device called the Connexus BCI. The company designed it to capture detailed neural signals that support real-time communication for people who cannot speak. This system uses high-resolution electrodes and an implanted wireless setup to record activity from individual neurons involved in forming speech.",
      "The Connexus BCI has a titanium body with more than 400 platinum-iridium electrodes placed just below the brain's surface. Each electrode is thinner than a human hair. These electrodes record neural firing patterns in the motor cortex, where the brain controls the lips, tongue and larynx.",
      "Surgeons place the implant under the skin and connect it with a thin cable to a wireless transceiver in the chest. That transceiver sends data through a secure optical link to a second transceiver worn on the body. The external unit powers the system with inductive charging similar to wireless phone chargers.",
      "The collected signals then move to a compact computer that runs advanced language models. It analyzes the neural activity and converts it into text or into a synthetic voice based on the user's past recordings.",
      "Inside the Paradromics BCI human trial",
      "The trial begins with two participants. Each person will receive one 7.5-millimeter-wide electrode array placed 1.5 millimeters into the part of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx. During training sessions, the volunteers will imagine speaking sentences while the device learns the neural signatures of each sound.",
      "This is the first BCI trial that formally targets real-time synthetic voice generation. The study will also test whether the system can detect imagined hand movements and translate those signals into cursor control.",
      "If early results meet expectations, the trial could expand to ten people. Some participants may receive two implants to capture a richer set of signals.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Cyberguy reached out to Paradromics for comment and received the following statement:",
      "Researchers are testing whether Paradromics\u2019 fully implantable brain device can turn neural activity into real-time speech for people with paralysis. (Synchron)",
      "\"Communication is a fundamental human need. For people with severe motor impairment, the inability to express themselves with family and friends or request basic needs makes living difficult. The FDA approved clinical study for the Connexus Brain-Computer Interface is the first step toward a future where commercially available neurotech can restore the ability to naturally speak and seamlessly use a computer.",
      "The fully implanted Connexus BCI is designed to record brain signals from individual neurons, capturing the massive amounts of data required for high performance applications like speech restoration and complex mouse and keyboard hand actions. Built from proven medical-grade materials, Connexus BCI is engineered for daily long-term use, backed by more than three years of stable pre-clinical recordings.",
      "How Paradromics compares to other BCI companies",
      "Paradromics joins Synchron and Neuralink at the front of the implanted BCI race. Synchron uses a stent-like device placed in a blood vessel to record broad neural patterns. Neuralink uses flexible threads with many recording sites to capture high-bandwidth signals from individual neurons.",
      "Paradromics sits in the middle of these two approaches by using a fully implantable system that still captures single-neuron detail. Researchers believe this design may offer long-term stability for everyday communication.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could make a major difference for people who have lost their ability to speak after ALS, stroke or spinal cord injury. A system that converts thought into speech could help them talk in real time and regain independence. It may also allow hands-free computer control, which can improve daily living.",
      "If the trial succeeds, the tech could change how assistive communication devices work and speed up patient access to advanced tools.",
      "During the trial, volunteers imagine speaking while advanced AI models learn their neural patterns and convert those signals into text or a synthetic voice. (Paradromics)",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Paradromics is taking a careful but bold path toward practical BCI communication. The first stage is small but meaningful. It sets the foundation for devices that may restore speech with natural flow and faster response times. As more trials move forward, this field could shift from experimental to everyday use faster than many expect.",

      "Security researchers say a phishing platform called Quantum Route Redirect, or QRR, is behind a growing wave of fake login pages hosted on nearly 1,000 domains. These pages look real enough to fool many users while also slipping past some automated scanners.",
      "QRR runs realistic email lures that mimic DocuSign requests, payment notices, voicemail alerts or QR-code prompts.

      "A fast follow to other major Microsoft credential attacks",
      "QRR appeared soon after Microsoft disrupted a major phishing network known as RaccoonO365. That service sold ready-made Microsoft login copies used to steal more than 5,000 sets of credentials, including accounts tied to over 20 US healthcare organizations. Subscribers paid as little as $12 a day to send thousands of phishing emails.",

Investigators tied him to the phishing code and a crypto wallet that earned more than $100,000. Microsoft and Health-ISAC have since filed a lawsuit in New York that accuses him of multiple cybercrime violations.",
      "Other recent examples include kits like VoidProxy, Darcula, Morphing Meerkat and Tycoon2FA. QRR builds on these tools with automation, bot filtering and a dashboard that helps attackers run large campaigns fast.",
      "What makes QRR so effective",
      "QRR uses about 1,000 domains. Many are real sites that were parked or compromised, which helps the pages pass as legitimate. The URLs also follow a predictable pattern that can look normal to users at a glance.",
      "The kit includes automated filtering that detects bots. It sends scanners to harmless pages and sends real people to the credential-harvesting site. Attackers can manage campaigns inside a control panel that logs traffic and activity. These features let them scale up quickly without technical skill.",
      "Security analysts say organizations can no longer depend on URL scanning alone. Layered defenses and behavioral analysis have become essential for spotting threats that use domain rotation and automated evasion.",

      "This can include arrival time, general order details, time spent and bill totals. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You do not need to book through OpenTable for this to happen. You only need an account and matching contact information.",
      "Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them.",
      "Why restaurants want these insights",
      "Restaurants have tracked guest preferences for years. Staff may note favorite dishes or preferred seating. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. This helps them shape a smooth visit.",
      "OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. A single business dinner can mark someone as a high spender. Eating with friends who order cocktails can make a person look like a cocktail lover. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals.",
      "THAT'S NOT A HUMAN TALKING TO YOU IN THE FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU",
      "How the AI works",
      "OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like \"glass of cabernet\") to consistently categorize them as \"red wine,\" \"white wine,\" etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles.",
      "The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences.",
      "A TikTok video from a Michelin-starred restaurant host first revealed the AI-assisted diner tags now being tested in OpenTable\u2019s Pro tools. (iStock)",
      "\"Guest insights are the engine of personalization, allowing restaurants to optimize their service and deliver the kind of thoughtful hospitality that both benefits the business and offers a special experience for the diner,\" an OpenTable representative told CyberGuy. \"These insights come from a mix of sources \u2014 including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners \u2014 and are limited to non-confidential information.\"",
      "\"They might help a server suggest a dish you\u2019ll love or recognize that you prefer a more relaxed dining pace,\" the representative said. \"We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. You\u2019re in charge of what data you share. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you\u2019ve made in your privacy preferences.\"",
      "What data gets shared and how to limit it",
      "If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable then turns this into aggregated insights.",
      "RESTAURANT INSIDERS SHARE THE SECRETS OF SNAGGING HARD-TO-GET RESERVATIONS",
      "OpenTable reportedly shares insights across its broader restaurant network. This applies only where enabled and only for restaurants on the OpenTable Pro plan, and is a feature in Beta.",
      "If you want more privacy, you can turn off the \"Point of sale information\" setting:",

      "Dining out should feel simple, yet today's tech adds a new layer to the experience. These AI-assisted tags give restaurants extra insight, but they also remind you how much of your behavior gets logged behind the scenes. By checking your privacy settings and turning off POS data sharing, you keep more control over what follows you from one meal to the next. Staying aware makes a big difference. It helps you enjoy your night out without wondering who's tracking your habits or how your data might appear on a screen.

      "A University of Oklahoma student who received a zero out of 25 on an assignment regarding gender norms says she was targeted for her Christian beliefs, citing a scathing response from the teacher's assistant who doled out the grade.",
      "Samantha Fulnecky is a junior pre-med student at the Sooner State's flagship university.",
      "\"I was asked to read an article and give my opinion on the article, and the article was about gender binary and mental health and gender stereotypes, specifically in children, because it's a lifespan development class,\" Fulnecky told Fox News Digital. \"So I was asked to give my opinion and my reaction to the paper.\"",
      "Fulnecky and her classmates were tasked with writing a response to a scholarly article titled \"Relations Among Gender Typicality, Peer Relations, and Mental Health During Early Adolescence,\" summarizing results of a study about gender norms among middle schoolers and the social ramifications children may face for not conforming to gender norms.",
      "Samantha Fulnecky is a junior at the University of Oklahoma. (Brian Bahr / Contributor)",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE CAMPUS RADICALS COAST TO COAST",
      "Students were asked to provide a \"thoughtful discussion of some aspect of the article.\" The assignment provided eight suggestions for how to respond, including, \"An application of the study or results to your own experiences,\" \"Your own thoughts about how development proceeds in the domain being researched in the article\" and whether the student thought the topic was worthy of further study.",
      "\"So I did this assignment the same as I would any other in that class, gave my opinion on gender binary and gender stereotypes and that, naturally my views are from the Bible and my Christian kind of worldview,\" she said. \"And so that's what I wrote about and I didn't think anything of it.\"",
      "Fulnecky, citing her Christian beliefs, responded that traditional gender roles should be reinforced, not degraded.",
      "\"The article discussed peers using teasing as a way to enforce gender norms. I do not necessarily see this as a problem. God made male and female and made us differently from each other on purpose and for a purpose,\" Fulnecky wrote in her essay. \"God is very intentional with what He makes, and I believe trying to change that would only do more harm.\"",
      "\"Gender roles and tendencies should not be considered 'stereotypes,'\" her essay continued. \"Women naturally want to do womanly things because God created us with those womanly desires in our hearts. The same goes for men. God created men in the image of His courage and strength, and He created women in the image of His beauty. He intentionally created women differently than men and we should live our lives with that in mind.\"",

      "Later in her essay, she denounced peers who conform to popular discourse on gender so they \"do not step on people's toes,\" adding that she thinks it is \"cowardly and insincere\" of those who do.",
      "The essay refers to Genesis, the first book of the Bible, in which God created men and women, and says that women are intended to be men's helpers. She defined the Hebrew translation of \"helper\" \u2014 \"ezer kenegdo\" \u2014 as \"helper equal to [man],\" making the point that God did not make women subordinate to men.",
      "\"Society [is] pushing the lie that there are multiple genders and everyone should be whatever they want to be is demonic and severely harms American youth,\" the essay continued. \"I do not want kids to be teased or bullied in school. However, pushing the lie that everyone has their own truth and everyone can do whatever they want and be whoever they want is not biblical whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Overall, reading articles such as this one encourage me to one day raise my children knowing that they have a Heavenly Father who loves them and cherishes them deeply and that having their identity firmly rooted in who He is will give them the satisfaction and acceptance that the world can never provide for them,\" the essay concludes.",

      "\"Additionally, to call an entire group of people 'demonic' is highly offensive, especially a minoritized population,\" Curth said.",
      "\"I definitely think that I was being punished for what I believe because I very clearly stated in my essay in my response to the article, I very clearly stated my beliefs and stated what \u2014 not just my beliefs \u2014 but what the Bible and what God says about gender and about those roles,\" Fulnecky said.",

Thousands of ordinary Lebanese braved a steady rain in the morning to line his motorcade route, some throwing flower petals and rice on his car in a gesture of welcome.",
      "History\u2019s first American pope is on his maiden papal voyage, and it has taken him to the heart of Christianity: First to Turkey to commemorate a founding profession of the Christian faith and now to Lebanon to encourage an ancient Christian community in a country that is unique in the Arab world for its religious tolerance.",

At the end of the event, the spiritual leaders planted an olive sapling as a symbol of peace.",

Despite a ceasefire, Israel has carried out almost daily airstrikes targeting Hezbollah members.",

Officials arrested her father and two brothers, then aged 22 and 24, and charged them in connection with her killing, which prosecutors said likely happened on May 22.",
      "\"They saw Ryan as a burden that had to be removed,\" the Public Prosecution Service said Friday. \"Just because she was a young woman who wanted to live her own life.\"",
      "Authorities said her male relatives, who come from what they described as a \"strict\" Islamic family, allegedly killed her after believing she was \"behaving too Western in the eyes of her family.\" Al Najjar was reportedly targeted after refusing to wear a headscarf in public-like settings.",

      "\"Once the suspects were aware of the video, they started looking for Ryan,\" the authorities added. \"According to the Public Prosecution Service, her brothers visited her in Rotterdam and convinced her to come along to a remote location the night before her murder. She was taken to Knardijk, where their father joined. There she was killed.\"",
      "Local media NL Times identified the brothers as Mohamed Al Najjar and Muhanad, and their 53-year-old father as Khaled. All three were charged with murdering the young woman, while their father was accused of orchestrating the killing before likely fleeing to Syria, prosecutors said.",

Evidence showed signs of strangulation and drowning, and approximately 60 feet of tape had been used to bind her before she was thrown into the water alive.

      "Pope Leo XIV arrived in Lebanon on Sunday, opening the second half of his first international trip as pontiff after three days in Turkey marked by calls for unity, peace and renewed ties among Christian communities.",
      "His stop in Lebanon places him in a nation where Christians have long-faced war, instability and a wave of emigration that has reshaped the country\u2019s demographics.",
      "Lebanon was once a Christian-majority country, a balance reflected in the 1932 census that recorded Christians as just over half the population. No official count has been conducted since, but demographic studies and independent estimates show a significant shift over the past century. As Reuters reported, Christians are now \"believed to make up roughly a third of Lebanon\u2019s population,\" a decline driven by emigration, conflict, and changing birth rates.",

      "JP De Gance, founder and president of Communio, told Fox News Digital that the choice of Turkey and Lebanon as the pope\u2019s first destinations is intentional. \"Pope Leo chose to make Turkey and Lebanon the site of his first trip very likely to emphasize two major themes of his pontificate. Coming out of the conclave that elected him, he has placed a great emphasis on both unity and on peace.\"",
      "Lebanon marks the most emotionally charged part of the trip. The last papal visit came in 2012. Pope Francis had hoped to travel there but was unable to make the journey because of health concerns. Lebanon is often described as having the highest proportion of Christians in the Middle East, yet these communities have been devastated by economic collapse, political paralysis and mass migration over the last decade.",

      "The Associated Press reported that the pope\u2019s schedule includes meetings with political leaders, Christian and Muslim clerics, and families affected by overlapping national crises. A key moment will come on Dec. 2 when he visits the Port of Beirut, the site of the 2020 explosion that killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands. His presence there is expected to draw significant attention in a country where many still demand accountability for the blast.",

      "The pope arrives amid one of Lebanon\u2019s most volatile periods in years, with repeated exchanges of fire along the southern border throughout 2024 and 2025 between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. The clashes displaced residents and raised fears of a wider conflict, prompting questions about whether the situation might force last-minute changes to the papal itinerary.",

He added that \"the situation was already well known even a few months ago, and all necessary precautionary measures have been taken.\"",
      "De Gance said the Lebanon leg underscores the pope\u2019s focus on Christians in the most vulnerable regions. \"In terms of peace, I believe the pope has added Lebanon to this trip because a great many Christian communities \u2014 both those in full communion with Rome and those who are Eastern Orthodox \u2014 are suffering in a war-torn region.\"",
      "He added that the trip also aims to draw international attention to communities often overlooked. \"Leo likely wants to bring the bully pulpit of the papacy to the region to bring a message of peace that also advocates for those often forgotten in the West \u2014 our Eastern Christian brothers and sisters.\"",

      "De Gance highlighted the significance of the commemoration. \"Pope Leo chose to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, which has such historic significance because this council helped define the reality \u2014 now still accepted by Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox \u2014 that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man.\" He added, \"At the time of the council, a great many Christians had begun to reject this central apostolic truth.

Al-Shabab has leveraged this shifting international focus to reconsolidate its areas of operations. The group\u2019s advances have taken place against a backdrop of Somalia\u2019s increasingly fragmented domestic political landscape.

      "But their enemies-to-lovers romance has brought plenty of strife to their lives due to the class difference between them (hence the subtitle, \"The World Between Us.\")",
      "If it wasn't clear from Season 1, Season 2 has firmly established that James' father, Mortimer (Fedja van Hu\u00eat), is the show's big bad. In the wake of the death of his wife \u2014 which was revealed in the last minutes of the Season 1 finale \u2014 his efforts to control his children, James and Lydia (Sonja Wei\u00dfer), only intensified.",

Since Season 1, he's had on-again, off-again trysts with Lydia Beaufort, who's now pregnant with twins. He's summoned before school leaders, including Mortimer, to explain what happened.",
      "During that meeting, it's revealed the affair was discovered via a photo. (Remember: In Episode 5, Elaine (Eli Riccardi), who's in love with James, and Cyril (Ben Felipe), who's long pined for Lydia, discovered Lydia and Graham embracing in the woods during a school function and took a photo as evidence.)",
      "But when Graham sees the photo that started the inquest, it turns out to be a picture not of him and Lydia, but of him and Ruby from a school gala in Season 1.",

      "She identifies the turning point for her character as James' speech in Episode 3. Filling in as a last minute speaker for Ruby's gala, James opened up about his mother's death and his mental health \u2014 even at the risk of his father's ire.",
      "\"She's deciding to give him a second chance, and I think I love that about her,\" Herbig-Matten says.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time, when the members of Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer started to create their sixth album, they already knew what they wanted it to look and feel like.",
      "\"When you can see something in your head, it's more inspiring to get there,\" guitarist Michael Clifford says. \"You're not shooting in the dark like, 'I wonder what this is gonna be like?' You have an idea, and you can drive the ship there.\"",
      "The result was \"Everyone's A Star,\" which dropped Nov. 14. Arguably their most meta album yet, the 12 tracks \u2014 plus four bonus tracks on a deluxe edition that dropped Nov. 17 \u2014 discuss fame, self-destruction and the \"boyband\" culture they've at times rejected and embraced since the group formed in 2011.",
      "The album is less about the personal inspirations that defined their previous hits and more about a \"togetherness,\" says bassist Calum Hood\u00a0\u2014 fitting for a band that is still standing after each member has released at least one solo album.",
      "Below, 5 Seconds of Summer discuss new aspects to their sound, preparing for the \"Everyone\u2019s a Star! World Tour\" and the \"larger-than-life\" characters featured on their latest album \u2014 the band's first in three years.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Calum Hood: It's definitely not a singular conversation that we have at the start of every album. We don't all sit down together and be like, \"OK, what have we accomplished?\"",
      "I feel like we've lived so much life in this band, we intuitively know the different paths that we've taken. And it's very much an intuition-lead thing, moving into a new album process, examining what's happening in everyone's lives, and seeing where that collectively wants to go.",
      "Luke Hemmings: \"No. 1 Obsession\" was the first one. And that was like, \"OK, this feels like it's ticking all the boxes.\" It felt very 5SOS, reclaiming back a bit of that punk rock, garage spirit, but had lyrics that felt very eye catching, even though it's ear catching, I guess.",
      "And that was the one to beat for a while. It felt like a nice blueprint to go from there, because it takes a minute to figure out what the next album's sounds going to be like. You're sort of stabbing in the dark for a while \u2014 especially after the last album had a very specific sound and feeling to it. We love challenging that on the next album, trying to totally 180-flip ... (and saying) what does it feel like if we did the opposite?",
      "LH: Sonically, it has a lot of dance elements in it, like New York and London, Cassius, Prodigy, those dancier acts that still feel like they have a rawness to them. And it's mixed (with a sound) only 5SOS could do; ironic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, but with lots of wisdom behind it. There's a little bit of social satire and self- deprecating humor in it. The sound is a mix of the pop rock, punk, garage band we started as, but mixed in with more dance element roots.",
      "That kind of sounds confusing as f---. (Laughs.) So I don't know.",
      "Michael Clifford: I don't think so.",
      "I think we're finally old enough \u2014\u00a0we're not old, sorry \u2014 we're young enough. We've been doing this for a minute, not too long, but we've been doing it for a little bit and we are able to understand a little bit more, just get perspective on things. I think that it was crucial for us to be able to have that perspective in order to make an album that has those types of themes in it.",
      "And like Luke said, trying to flip it on its head and trying to do the opposite of the last thing that we did, I think, was what we found so exciting about this.",
      "This has been the first time that we've really made an album knowing what we wanted it to look like and feel like in mind. We sort of had an idea of the theme and the feeling that we wanted this to evoke. So it made making it a lot easier and more inspiring. When you can see something in your head, sometimes it's more inspiring to get there because you're not shooting in the dark and like, \"I wonder what this is gonna be like?\" You kind of have an idea and you can drive the ship there.",
      "CH: It's definitely a cool feeling. These guys are kind of the only other three that can really resonate with my life's journey the last 15 years. I gain a lot of comfort from that. And it differs within our last albums, where a lot of the songs thematically come very personally. It's very personal-led, that's how we start songs. But this album felt more \u2014 there was a togetherness of the theme of the album and conceptually that felt really fresh and new. And there's definitely, subconsciously, a lot of healing from that, too.",
      "LH: I feel good. The last show we did, the \"Five Seconds of Summer Show,\" it felt like we unlocked our full evolution, or almost full evolution, as a band with mixing in the 10-year anniversary skits. It was more of treating it as an entertainment piece, as opposed to just ... (getting) out there and crank(ing) out some songs and play as a band. But it had multimedia and it was blurring the lines between the video and then the on-screen and onstage. It was really fun to do and it felt like the most \"us\" a show has been.",
      "So this time, because the characters that we have in this album, their egos are a bit more inflated, the show will reflect that. The people that have the big heads in \"Telephone Busy\" \u2014 those guys are making the show. They're behind the wheel and they're kind of crazy.",
      "MC: They've got some damage.",
      "LH: (Laughs.) It'll be like the 5SOS show we did but on steroids.",
      "MC: Not even steroids.",
      "LH: What's crazier than steroids?",
      "MC: Nothing that's appropriate to say on the TODAY show.",
      "CH: No, no, it's like Green Goblin-esque.",
      "LH: So if the Green Goblin was the fifth. Does that make any sense? (Laughs.)",
      "MC: I don't know. It's not as heady and narrative as that, but it sometimes made approaching concepts \u2014 and like Calum was saying \u2014 instead of going into the meaning of a song and being like, \"Do I personally resonate with this?\" It was more about like, \"Does my place within this story we're trying to tell, how do I embody that?\" Rather than trying to do anything that's too narratively driven. We always are going to be ourselves. We're just  ourselves in an alternate universe.",
      "LH: It's like the larger than life version of ourselves and we're back together. Especially after doing separate solo things, now together \u2014 we are like super, super 5SOS, I guess.",
      "CH: SuperSOS.",
      "MC: The conversation that we had behind it was like, we're our best, biggest versions of ourselves \u2014 well I'm the best, biggest version of myself when I'm doing my solo music \u2014\u00a0but also when I do the band's music. So they're the best versions of themselves when they're in the band.",
      "LH: This is a confusing read. (Laughs).",
      "CH: I agree, you're not your best version.",
      "MC: No, I said I am.",
      "LH: You're not your best version right now. (Laughs.)",
      "LH: We were telling people when we first started that we're going to be a band for 10, 15, 20, 30 years. And everyone, when you're 16 and 17, they're like, \"OK, cool,\" because usually the life cycle of a boy band is short. It's like a butterfly or something.",
      "MC: I think Ash has something to say as well.",
      "Ashton Irwin (mid-hair and makeup): What? ... Don't talk to me while I'm getting my makeup done.",
      "LH: You can legitimately quote that.",
      "I don't know if I'd tell (my younger self) anything. I'd just maybe, I'd just give him a soft drink. Maybe a cheeky pat on the back would be nice.",
      "CH: Maybe a foot-long Subway sandwich. Call it a day.",
      "LH: We've been telling people we're going to be a band for this long and I'm really happy that we stuck it out. We have a f------ amazing fan base that let us change and evolve and experiment with new sounds and looks and everything, and I still feel the same. And that's crazy to be some people's No. 1 obsession still. Sometimes I just feel like I'm a walking ghost.",

      "The duo tried to come up with this year's signal when Hoda surprised Jenna on TODAY on Nov. 25 for Jenna's birthday, but they couldn't quite nail it.",
      "Jenna & Friends guest co-host Andy Cohen voted for a \u201cJersey Shore\u201d-style fist pump, while Jenna offered a simple one that clearly planted a seed for Hoda.",
      "\u201cSomebody said this year you should just go, \u2018Hi Jenna!\u2019\u201d Jenna said while Hoda laughed.",
      "Hoda suggested stretching her arms as if she were waking up from a nap.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jenna said before laughing.",
      "During the 2024 parade, Hoda broke out a double fist pump to signal Jenna at home.",
      "The move was inspired by the music video for the song \u201cRockaFellaCenta\u201d by Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang, in which Hoda and Jenna make a guest appearance. The \"Las Culturistas\" podcast hosts were both in attendance at the 2025 parade on Thursday.",
      "Hoda gave the secret signal a second time in 2024 and got Savannah Guthrie to join in while singer Kylie Minogue performed \u201cCan\u2019t Get You Out of My Head\" during the parade.",
      "Hoda has also made special signals during the broadcast for her daughters, Haley, 8, and Hope, 6, in past years.",
      "\u201cTold Haley I would give her a secret signal from parade to say I love you!\u201d tug on my ear a la @carolburnett),\u201d Hoda wrote on Instagram in 2020.",
      "Before the 2023 Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, Hoda revealed her daughters had asked her to blow a kiss to them. She and Jenna also came up with the secret signal in which Hoda quickly rubbed her teeth with her finger, as if to wipe off lipstick, while on camera."

    "story": [
      "Elizabeth Taylor seemed larger-than-life on screen, and according to Neil Zevnik, her personal chef for nearly a decade in the \u201890s, she also threw larger-than-life parties at home.",
      "\u201cWe always did an enormous single table,\u201d Zevnik tells TODAY.com of her Thanksgiving dinners, attended by 40-plus guests at her ranch-style home in Bel Air, California. Formerly an actor, he worked as Taylor\u2019s chef from 1991 until 1999.",
      "Zevnik says, while he would typically only cook for her, holidays were a special case. As he prepared the feast, movers would remove all her furniture from her living and trophy rooms to make space for a square of banquet tables, which he says he also decorated.",
      "\u201cI would literally take off my shoes and have to get up there on the table,\u201d he says. \u201cI would do these very elaborate centerpieces with fabrics and vases of flowers and tchotchkes and candles.\u201d",
      "Taylor liked to seat all at the same table, he says, adding that kids, adults, celebrities and noncelebs all sat together, \u201cbecause then who gets to sit with her?\u201d",
      "For turkey day, Zevnik would prepare traditional fare: turkey, mashed potatoes, classic bread stuffing, cornbread sausage stuffing, sweet potato casserole, green beans, creamed pearl onions, fresh cranberry peach relish and a mince meat pie.",
      "\u201cYou know, she liked cranberry jelly out of the can, sliced,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cHer two favorite things for Thanksgiving would be turkey wings and gravy, and the turkey wings needed to be crispy and crunchy and salty, and she wanted several of them,\u201d Zevnik recalls. \u201cLots of gravy.\u201d",
      "Scroll to the bottom for his crispy turkey wing recipe.",
      "Taylor required her chef to make extra portions of those two dishes so there would be plenty to pile on her plate as well as leftovers.",
      "On days when she wasn\u2019t entertaining, Taylor\u2019s solo meals were casual \u2014 but never boring.",
      "\u201cGenerally, we wouldn\u2019t make a whole lot of plans in advance,\u201d Zevnik says. He would arrive to cook during the day and provide her options \u201cprepped to a certain point,\u201d as well as her favorites that he could easily whip up.",
      "\u201cAt some point, she\u2019d say, \u2018Okay, what do we got today?\u2019\u201d he says. He would ask her what she was in the mood for: salty, crunchy, creamy, healthy, etc. \u201cThen we would go from there.\u201d",
      "Every afternoon, Zevnik says Taylor would have him cook for everyone working at the house. \u201cAll the staff would gather and sit down together in the kitchen.\u201d",
      "Taylor was very open to trying new cuisines, but since she was brough up in the U.K., she especially loved British foods, like roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and Marmite.",
      "She was also a fan of sweets \u2014 in fact, she loved Zevnik\u2019s \u201ctoffee fudgies\u201d so much, she had a fridge stocked with them in her bedroom.",
      "Zevnik has since worked for a long list of celebrities \u2014 Reese Witherspoom, Jennifer Garner, Pierce Brosanan and Charlize Theron, to name a few \u2014 but those years with Taylor still inspire him.",
      "\u201cShe was one of the most loyal and giving people I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he says. She began her AIDS advocacy in the \u201880s, when most celebrities refused to help, and eventually established the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give a f--- what people thought. She did what she thought was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "When she disliked a stew he made, he recalls, she \u201ckind of ate a little bit of it, and then was kind of done.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe very kindly said, \u2018I think we won\u2019t make that one again.\u2019\u201d",

      "Fresh off negotiations with Ukrainian officials in Florida this weekend, Steve Witkoff is expected to lay out for Putin a version of the peace plan that has been agreed with Kyiv, hoping the Russian leader will compromise on his hardline demands.",
      "For months, Moscow has reiterated its readiness for peace while also signaling it was not willing to ease off on its core maximalist demands, which would leave Ukraine weak and isolated.",
      "\"This will be, we have no doubt, a very important step towards a peaceful settlement,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.",
      "President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will also participate in the talks between Witkoff and Putin, Peskov said.",
      "The details of the revamped peace plan have not been released. An original proposal approved by Trump last month was seen as heavily biased toward Russia, and would have forced Kyiv to cede its territories to Moscow, including the land that it currently still controls. It would have limited the size of Kyiv's army and barred Ukraine from ever joining NATO.",
      "The proposal blindsided Kyiv, which launched a storm of negotiations in Europe and the U.S. to try to amend the plan and make it more palatable to Ukraine.",
      "Putin invaded Ukraine in February of 2022 in what has become Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Despite expecting Kyiv to surrender in a matter of days, the war has dragged on. The Ukrainian army, backed by Western weapons, has managed to not only resist the onslaught, but counter-attack. Still, the Russians are now in control of roughly one-fifth of the Ukrainian territory.",
      "Any resolution that the U.S. manages to broker could shape the future of not just Ukraine but the entire continent by either aligning with Russia and rewarding aggression, or backing Ukraine and the security structure currently in place.",
      "Sidelined by Washington, Europe has been scrambling to respond to Trump's peace proposals. Its efforts have not been sufficient to turn around Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield, although they have increased their aid to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's beleaguered government.",
      "As focus shifts to talks in Moscow, Zelenskyy has been on a visible diplomatic offensive in Europe as he struggles to boost backing for Ukraine.",
      "Putin signaled last week that he was ready for a \u201cserious\u201d discussion with the U.S. and said that a version of the plan that was agreed during talks with Ukrainians in Geneva, Switzerland, last month could form the \"framework\" of a final peace settlement. Still, he said his army had the upper hand on the battlefield and if no agreement was reached, he would get what he wanted by force.",
      "Wearing a military uniform, Putin received reports from his generals Monday that Russian troops have completely \"liberated\" the city of Pokrovsk, an important Ukrainian transport and supply hub in the Donetsk region. Ukraine denied reports that the city was entirely under Russian control. Pokrovsk's capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger cities and the whole region.",
      "It comes as Zelenskyy's government has been weakened by a major corruption scandal. His powerful chief of staff and top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, resigned last week after being implicated in the probe."

    "story": [
      "The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand why measles matters,\u201d said Dr. Kate O\u2019Brien, director of the WHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \u201cIts high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.\u201d",
      "That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.",
      "\"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet,\" O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its Weekly Epidemiological Record.",
      "Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the most in a decade. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.",
      "Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.",
      "Elimination status threatened",
      "The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.",
      "Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)",
      "In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.",
      "Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.",
      "But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada met that threshold this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.",

      "The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak.",
      "Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs \"are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States,\" Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.",

      "Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City.

    "story": [
      "In the latest twist in human evolution, scientists have discovered that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belonged to a previously unknown ancient relative.",
      "Dated to around 3.4 million years ago, the species was likely similar to Lucy, an ancient human relative who lived in the area at around the same time, according to a study published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.",
      "But researchers found that the Burtele foot \u2014 named after the place in northeastern Ethiopia where it was discovered in 2009 \u2014  was unmistakably different.",
      "With an opposable big toe resembling a human thumb, the fossilized Burtele foot suggests its owner was a skilled climber, spending more time in the trees than Lucy, the study said.",
      "For decades, Lucy\u2019s species was considered the ancestor of all later hominids \u2014 an ancient relative more closely related to humans, including Homo sapiens, than to chimpanzees.",
      "Scientists were unable to confirm the foot belonged to a new species until they were able to study new fossils, including a jawbone with 12 teeth, that were found at the same site.",
      "After identifying them as Australopithecus deyiremeda, they found the Burtele foot belonged to the same species.",
      "John Rowan, an assistant professor in human evolution at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge, said their conclusion was \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we have much stronger evidence that, at the same time, there lived a closely related but adaptively distinct species,\u201d Rowan, who was not associated with the study, told NBC News in an email Thursday.",
      "The study also looked at how these species shared the same environment. The research team, led by Yohannes Haile-Selassie from Arizona State University, concluded that the new species spent much of its time in the forest.",
      "Lucy, or Australopithecus afarensis, likely roamed the ground, the study said, before going on to suggest that the two species likely had different diets and used the landscape in different ways.",
      "Multiple examinations of the newly found teeth indicated that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than Lucy and likely relied on a diet of leaves, fruit and nuts, the study said.",
      "\u201cThese differences meant that they were unlikely to be directly competing for the same resources,\u201d said Ashleigh L.A. Wiseman, an assistant research professor at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, which is also based at the U.K.\u2019s University of Cambridge.",
      "Highlighting the broader impact of this discovery on our understanding of evolution, Wiseman said in an email Thursday that the findings reminded us \u201cthat human evolution wasn\u2019t a straight ladder with one species turning into the next.\u201d",
      "Instead, she said, it should be viewed as a family tree with several so-called \u201ccousins\u201d alive at the same time, and each having a different way of surviving. \u201cDid they interact? We will likely never know the answer to that question,\u201d she added.",
      "Rowan also contended that as the number of well-documented human-related species grows, so do our questions about our ancestry. \u201cWhich species were our direct ancestors? Which were close relatives? That\u2019s the tricky part,\u201d he said. \u201cAs species diversity grows, so do the number of plausible reconstructions for how human evolution played out.\u201d",
      "And Wiseman cautioned against making definitive species assignments, as those should rest on well-preserved parts of skull and fossils that belong to multiple associated individuals. While the new research strengthens the case for A. deyiremeda\u2019s existence, she said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t remove all other alternative interpretations.\u201d"

      "Under Israel\u2019s Basic Law, the country\u2019s president has the power to pardon criminals or reduce their sentence.

      "Defense Minister Israel Katz and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir both immediately backed the proposed pardon on Sunday, with Katz citing the \u201ccomplex security reality\u201d in Israel.",
      "Netanyahu has previously cited the war in Gaza and security concerns while seeking delays in the court proceedings.",

      "The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.",
      "\u201cAdm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" she added.",

      "One U.S. official and a source familiar with the Pentagon\u2019s actions on Sept. 2 told NBC News recently that the first of the two strikes conducted that day left at least two survivors, with the subsequent strike killing them.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post Monday night, also indicated that Bradley ordered the second strike. \"Let\u2019s make one thing crystal clear: Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",
      "On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Hegseth didn't order the second strike.",
      "\"He said he didn't do it,\" said Trump, who also said he didn't know if the second strike even happened.

I\u2019m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Asked Monday what law the U.S. military relied on to justify the second strike, Leavitt said: \u201cThe strike conducted on Sept. 2 was conducted in self-defense to protect Americans in vital United States interests. The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d",
      "She also confirmed that Trump would be meeting with his national security team \u2014 which includes Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller \u2014 in the Oval Office later Monday. A senior White House official confirmed Monday night that the meeting had wrapped.",

      "Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash. \u2014 said they were taking \"seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\"",
      "Smith told reporters Monday night that he would be receiving a classified briefing this week from Bradley about the strikes. He added that it would be \"helpful\" to have Hegseth testify.",
      "The details of the briefing with Bradley are still being worked out, Smith said, but he indicated that they are aiming for it to take place Thursday.",
      "Bradley is expected to be in Washington this week to speak with senior lawmakers about the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "Wicker, who also said he will be speaking with Bradley, said Monday that he has spoken with Hegseth about the second strike. The defense secretary is also expected to have spoken or is soon speaking with other lawmakers, according to two other people familiar with matter.",
      "Wicker and Smith both said they have spoken with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Hegseth has defended the numerous U.S. strikes in the Caribbean, saying in a post on X Friday after The Washington Post article was published that \"these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be 'lethal, kinetic strikes.'\"",
      "\"Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict \u2014 and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,\" he wrote.",

      "The strikes in the Caribbean are part of an escalating pressure campaign the Trump administration is waging against Venezuela.

      "Just as peace talks were gaining traction, Ukraine has lost its lead negotiator.",
      "Andriy Yermak, an ever-present figure at President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s side throughout the war with Russia, resigned as chief of staff on Friday after an anti-corruption raid at his home, injecting fresh uncertainty for Ukraine\u2019s leadership.",
      "The exit leaves a vacuum around Zelenskyy as talks accelerate, isolating the Ukrainian president at a critical moment and creating an opening Moscow may try to exploit, analysts say.",
      "The development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that aligned with Moscow\u2019s hard-line demands. An initial deadline of Thursday, imposed by the White House, passed without any announcement as Ukraine and its allies pushed back against calls for the country to cede territory.",
      "Ukrainian negotiators, led by Yermak, secured changes, and Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff will now head to Moscow for talks next week with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russia still wants to move toward peace despite its belief that Zelenskyy was not a legitimate leader.",
      "But analysts warn that Yermak\u2019s departure leaves Kyiv navigating unfamiliar waters, as Zelenskyy is forced to steer Ukraine through high-stakes negotiations without his most trusted aide.",
      "Yermak\u2019s resignation comes at a \u201cvery bad time, because we\u2019re really at a possible tipping point where you know what Ukraine is demanding may not be granted or taken into consideration,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told NBC News by phone on Saturday.",
      "\u201cNone of us really know what Zelenskyy is like operating solo, because he never has,\u201d he said, adding that Yermak has \u201cbasically stood in\u201d for Zelenskyy at times.",
      "Rustem Umerov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, will lead Ukraine\u2019s delegation for a round of talks in the U.S. on Sunday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Umerov has also been mentioned by anti-corruption investigators. Neither he nor Yermak have faced charges.",
      "Bociurkiw added that Yermak\u2019s departure would be unlikely to change Ukraine\u2019s firm stance on territorial concessions, but that Russia \u201cwill try to manipulate and take advantage of this vacuum.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were due to attend Sunday\u2019s talks, a U.S. official told NBC News.",
      "Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant, echoed Bociurkiw\u2019s concerns, saying that Yermak\u2019s resignation, just days before major U.S.-Ukraine-Russia talks and a potential Trump-Putin summit, \u201cdisrupts Kyiv\u2019s preparations and invites counterparts to probe whether Ukraine\u2019s red lines on territory and NATO can be eased during the transition.\u201d",
      "But in the long term, Horowitz told NBC News on Saturday, Yermak\u2019s departure could even be a positive.",
      "Critics have said for years that Yermak had accumulated too much power and wielded excessive influence over Zelenskyy. A constant presence by the president\u2019s side through the ups and downs of the war, Yermak had emerged as one of the few men that the Ukrainian leader appeared to really trust.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously railed against corrupt officials, but signs that a corruption scandal may have stretched into his inner circle may provide more ammunition to critics of further support for Ukraine. Trump-aligned figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have previously criticized Ukraine for its issues with corruption.",
      "Yermak\u2019s departure may \u201creinforce skepticism within the Trump administration\u201d about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle, giving them further reasons to push for concessions, said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "But Horowitz said the resignation \u201cremoves a lightning rod for controversy and gives Kyiv a cleaner, more collective mandate to say no to an unfair and unsustainable peace,\u201d adding: \u201cZelenskyy is getting his house in order.\u201d",
      "When it comes to how the rule of law is being enforced in Ukraine, \u201cgenerally this is a good sign,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s bad enough that these accusations existed in the first place,\u201d he added, but \u201ceven those in the highest places are prosecuted when suspicions arise.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said in a video statement on Friday that he was looking for Yermak\u2019s replacement. \u201cRussia really wants Ukraine to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no mistakes on our part.\u201d",
      "Losing unity could mean losing the country and its future, he added.",
      "But Bociurkiw said time is \u201cnot on Ukraine\u2019s side right now.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re Ukraine at the moment, he added, \u201cyou need not only a physical army, but an army of diplomats and advocates.\u201d"

      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",
      "The Ritz-Carlton safari camp was \u201cnot surprising,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a culmination of a long time, of a direction of things leading this way.\u201d",
      "The camp holds a 2.2-star rating on Google Reviews, with many posters criticizing its environmental impact. Others have praised their stay at the park.",
      "A court is scheduled to hear the case in December.",
      "If Dapash is successful with his lawsuit, Buiting said it could \u201cset a very interesting precedent\u201d for future developments in the reserve.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal perspective, this could actually be groundbreaking, a turning point,\u201d she added."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has directed the federal agency that oversees legal immigration to the U.S. to conduct a sweeping review of green card holders from what the administration calls countries of concern, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Thursday.",
      "\u201cAt the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,\u201d USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said Thursday afternoon in a statement on X.",
      "Edlow said that protecting the country \u201cremains paramount\u201d and that \u201cthe American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration\u2019s reckless resettlement policies.\u201d",
      "Asked for details on which countries are considered \u201cof concern,\u201d USCIS pointed to a June presidential proclamation listing 19 countries \"considered deficient with regards to screening and vetting.\" Afghanistan is one of the countries on the list, which also includes Haiti, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "The USCIS announcement comes a day after two National Guard members were shot near the White House. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds, Trump said Thursday night, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe remained hospitalized in critical condition. They were in Washington as part of Trump\u2019s deployment of federal troops to several U.S. cities.",
      "Federal prosecutors say the suspect, an Afghan national who once assisted American forces, was resettled in the U.S. under a program called Operation Allies Welcome during the Biden administration following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Thursday morning that her office is reviewing the suspect\u2019s immigration history and the vetting process that allowed his entry into the country.",
      "In a long post on X Friday, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Joe Kent claimed that 85,000 Afghans were admitted to the U.S. under Biden without the \u201crigorous vetting that has protected us in the past.\u201d",
      "He continued, saying that the suspect was \"only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan, he was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.\"",
      "Those admitted under the Operation Allies Welcome program were required to undergo \"biometric and biographic screenings\" by law enforcement and counterterrorism authorities, according to a fact sheet prepared by the Biden administration.",
      "The suspect's immigration process continued into the Trump administration. He was granted asylum in April of this year, which typically occurs two weeks after a final interview with immigration authorities.",
      "In a video released by the White House, Trump called the attack in Washington, D.C., an \u201cact of terror\u201d and said additional National Guard troops would be deployed to the nation's capital.",
      "The administration said shortly after Trump's remarks that all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals will be halted indefinitely.",
      "Authorities have not provided a motive, but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said \u201cthis is a targeted shooting,\u201d and that the suspect appeared to target the guard members.",
      "Four senior law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation said the suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "Speaking with NBC News on Wednesday, a relative of Lakanwal said he arrived in the U.S. in September 2021 after serving in the Afghan Army for 10 years, alongside U.S. Special Forces. Lakanwal was living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.",
      "\u201cWe were the ones that were targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,\u201d said the relative. \u201cI cannot believe it that he might do this.\u201d",
      "A CIA spokesperson said Thursday that the alleged shooter \u201cpreviously worked with the USG (U.S. government), including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar that ended in 2021 following the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday night about Lakanwal's vetting and the fact that he worked with the CIA, Trump responded: \"He went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts. And that happens too, it happens too often with these people,\" an apparent reference to Afghans who came to the U.S. around the time of the 2021 withdrawal."

      "Ever since, they have documented daily life at the former convent on Instagram, with videos capturing a few of their favorite things, from candlemaking to boxing lessons.",
      "Church officials accused the nuns of breaking their vow of obedience during a standoff over their future, but on Friday a statement said they would be offered a chance to remain at the former convent \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d",

      "Their legal representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "The provost\u2019s spokesman, Harald Schiffl, told Austria\u2019s public broadcaster ORF that a deal would be good for all parties. He said that \u201cwhat is conveyed on social media is not truly the reality of monastic life.\u201d"

      "Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security Chris Tang told reporters Friday that 89 bodies could not yet be identified. Seventy-nine people were injured, he said. Tang declined to identify the genders and ages of the deceased, saying the investigation was ongoing and the data incomplete.",

      "The deadliest blaze in the Chinese territory in seven decades has nonetheless fueled calls for greater accountability and transparency from the local government over potential regulatory negligence.",

The 48-year-old said her family had managed to escape, adding, \u201cI really hope there are survivors. I\u2019m wishing for a miracle to happen.\u201d",
      "Tang said preliminary findings suggested the fire started in netting surrounding the lower floors at Wang Cheong House, one of the seven affected towers at the Wang Fuk Court building complex.",
      "Styrofoam on the windows, which was \u201chighly flammable,\u201d fueled the blaze to spread rapidly upward and extend to six more buildings, he said, adding that the flames shattered glass and penetrated interiors, burning both inside and outside the buildings simultaneously.",
      "The intense heat then ignited the bamboo scaffolding, which also sparked secondary fires when it fell down, he said.",
      "\u201cAlthough the mesh netting met certain flame-retardant requirements, they could still catch fire when exposed to high temperatures,\u201d Tang said. \u201cBamboo scaffolding could also catch fire,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are only flame-retardant. And this is our initial assessment of the situation.\u201d",
      "Within hours, Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption said in a statement that it had set up a \u201ctask force to launch a full investigation into possible corruption\u201d and eight people had been arrested including \u201cconsultants, scaffolding subcontractors and middleman.\u201d",
      "It came after police on Thursday searched the offices of Prestige Construction and Engineering Co., the registered contractor hired to carry out the renovations. Officers also arrested two directors and an engineering consultant on suspicion of manslaughter.",
      "Calls to the company by NBC News went unanswered.",
      "The cause of the fire also remains under investigation, which may take three to four weeks to complete, officials said at the Friday news briefing.
