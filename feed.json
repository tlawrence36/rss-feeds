      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Beach Boys' Mike Love was inducted into the 2025 Songwriters Hall of Fame on Thursday night, just one day after it was announced that his inimitable bandmate Brian Wilson had died.",
      "The actor \u2014 and lifelong Beach Boys fan \u2014 John Stamos introduced him. \u201cThere are songs that don't just play on the radio,\u201d Stamos said in his speech. \u201cMike Love is a songwriter's songwriter.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat an incredible honor this is,\u201d Clinton said in his speech. He talked about his early days in the legendary Brill Building song factory, which he described like going \u201cinto Oz.\u201d Being a songwriter, to him, required \u201cconsistent effort.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up chasing fame,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up chasing feeling ... Creativity has no limitations.\u201d",
      "His four children, R.J., Heavenly, Hannah Joy and Royal Jerkins, performed one of his best-known hits, Brandy and Monica's \u201cThe Boy Is Mine.\"",

      "When Gorley took the stage for his speech, he said he felt like he was in a \u201cfever dream\u201d or that he has \u201ccrashed a royal wedding.\u201d",
      "Legendary English songwriter Tony Macaulay was also honored. He is best known for such classics as The Foundations\u2019 \u201cBaby Now That I\u2019ve Found You\" and \u201cBuild Me Up Buttercup,\u201d the latter of which was performed for Macaulay by a spirited Debbie Gibson.",

      "Gracie Abrams received the eminent Hal David Starlight Award.",
      "Last year\u2019s inductees included Steely Dan, R.E.M., Timbaland, Hillary Lindsey and Dean Pitchford. At the induction ceremony last summer, R.E.M. stunned attendees by reuniting for an acoustic version of their alt-rock hit, \u201cLosing My Religion.\u201d",
      "The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969 to honor those creating popular music. A songwriter with a notable catalog of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song. Some already in the hall include Gloria Estefan, Carole King, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, Elton John and Bernie Taupin, Brian Wilson, James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Lionel Richie, Bill Withers, Neil Diamond and Phil Collins.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own. The last Grammy for best recording package went to \u201cBrat,\u201d the Charli xcx album whose distinctive cover was immediately embraced by pop culture and meme creators.",
      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",

      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it: The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.",
      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",

      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",

      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country\u2019s most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died",
      "BERLIN -- German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country's most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died. He was 95.",
      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "The \u201cbones\u201d of Theo Jansen\u2019s \u201cstrandbeesten\u201d \u2014 beach animals in Dutch \u2014 have taken over a former cable factory in Delft, the small city in the western Netherlands that Jansen has called home for decades.",
      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",
      "\u201cI cannot do anything else,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cAnd I am very happy with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "So he went to a megachurch youth group, which promised teenage shenanigans without much danger. The \u201csanitized mischief,\u201d as he describes it, was perfect for Morris, who grew up as a nerdy, nervous kid.",
      "\u201cYouth group was great for me,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe can put on a show, we can sing little songs, we can do little skits.

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

      "YEONCHEON, South Korea -- Hundreds of fans gathered in the early morning hours to catch a glimpse of K-pop superstars Jimin and Jung Kook, the latest and final members of BTS to be discharged from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.",
      "The pair wore their military uniforms Wednesday, saluted and addressed fans who had assembled to see the pair after their discharge.",
      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country musician Conner Smith fatally hit a pedestrian while driving his truck in Nashville over the weekend, and he currently faces no charges as an investigation continues, police said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police said Smith, 24, hit Dorothy Dobbins, 77, Sunday evening while she was crossing the road inside a marked crosswalk. Dobbins, a retired attorney, later died at a hospital. The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",
      "Police say Smith showed no signs of impairment. They believe the \u201cpreliminary contributing factor\u201d appears to be that Smith did not yield the right of way to the pedestrian.",
      "Smith\u2019s attorney, Worrick Robinson, said his client is cooperating with the investigation.",
      "\u201cHis heart goes out to Ms. Dobbins\u2019 family during this incredibly difficult time,\" Robinson said in a statement.",
      "Dobbins was a leader in the city\u2019s legal aid and family law communities, where she practiced for over 40 years, according to posts by the Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. She played a \u201cfoundational role in opening Nashville\u2019s first domestic violence shelter,\u201d according to a Facebook post from the Legal Aid Society, and she wrote the state\u2019s first order of protection legislation.",

      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",

      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",

      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",

      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",

      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",

      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to.

      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court sided with a teenage girl with a rare form of epilepsy on Thursday in a unanimous ruling that could make it easier for families like hers to go to court over access to education.",
      "The girl's family says that her Minnesota school district didn\u2019t do enough to make sure she has the accommodations she needs to learn, including failing to provide adequate instruction in the evening when her seizures are less frequent.",
      "But lower courts ruled against the family's discrimination claims in court, despite finding the school had fallen short. That\u2019s because courts in that part of the country require plaintiffs in lawsuits against schools to show officials used \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment,\u201d a higher legal standard than most disability discrimination claims.",
      "The family appealed to the Supreme Court. The district, Osseo Area Schools, said that lowering the legal standard could expose the country\u2019s understaffed public schools to more lawsuits if their efforts fall short, even if officials are working in good faith.",
      "The district also argued that all claims over accommodations for people with disabilities should be held to the same higher standard \u2014 a potentially major switch that would have been a \u201cfive-alarm fire\u201d for the disability rights community, the girl's lawyers said.",

      "Every month, thousands of women evade abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to send them pregnancy-ending drugs through the mail",
      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",
      "But it wasn't until 2023 that telehealth abortions across states became more popular, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",
      "Pills can arrive in a less than a week.",
      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",
      "Other telehealth abortion providers said they also won't be deterred by legal threats.",
      "\u201cI have been working in this field for 25 years and this is part of the work,\" said Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, founder and director of Aid Access, an abortion pill supplier. \u201dIt\u2019s something that we all anticipated would happen,\" she said of the legal challenges.",
      "A doctor who is part of A Safe Choice, a network of California-based physicians that prescribes abortion pills to women in all 50 states, told The Associated Press he believes he is protected by the state's shield law, but is also taking precautions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to be traveling outside of California for a very long time,\u201d said the doctor, who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wanted to protect his identity for safety reasons.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",

    "story": [
      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "The U.S. is up to 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year",
      "The U.S. logged fewer than 30 measles cases this week as Ohio health officials confirmed three outbreaks in two counties were over.",
      "There have been 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed two cases in the last week.",
      "There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 2,083 cases from mid-October through June 10. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.",
      "Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 868 as of Thursday. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,179 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.",

      "In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.",
      "Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that\u2019s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.",
      "There are a total of 744 cases across 35 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Tuesday.",
      "Throughout the outbreak, 96 people have been hospitalized.",
      "State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases \u2014 fewer than 10 \u2014 are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas\u2019 cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 411 cases since late January \u2014 just under 2% of the county\u2019s residents.",
      "The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of \u201cwhat the child\u2019s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.\u201d A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.",
      "New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.",
      "Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state\u2019s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Don\u0303a Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.",
      "An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.",

      "Colorado has seen a total of 14 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of eight related cases.",
      "The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May, and includes four cases in Arapahoe County, three in El Paso County and one in Denver, plus a person who doesn't live in Colorado.",
      "Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.",
      "Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following week, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.",
      "The state's other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.",
      "Kansas has a total of 76 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but two of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.",
      "Montana had 20 measles cases as of Tuesday. Twelve were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up \u2014 Montana\u2019s first in 35 years.",
      "Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.",
      "There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.",
      "North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized, and all of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.",
      "There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.",

      "Earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania were declared over by health officials after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee\u2019s outbreak also appears to be over.",
      "Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\"",
      "Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 due to \u201cherd immunity.\u201d But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "ROME -- The Vatican on Sunday is beatifying a Congolese customs worker who was killed for resisting a bribe, giving young people in a place with endemic corruption a new model of holiness: Someone who refused to allow spoiled rice to be distributed to poor people.",
      "The head of the Vatican\u2019s saint-making office, Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, is presiding over the beatification ceremony Sunday at one of the pontifical basilicas in Rome, St. Paul Outside the Walls.",
      "The event is drawing Congolese pilgrims and much of Rome's Congolese Catholic community, who will be treated to a special audience Monday with Pope Leo XIV.",
      "Florib\u00e8rt Bwana Chui Bin Kositi was kidnapped and killed in 2007 after he refused to allow rancid rice from Rwanda to be transported across the border to the eastern Congo city of Goma.",
      "As an official with the Congolese government\u2019s custom\u2019s quality control office, the 26-year-old knew the risks of resisting bribes offered to public officials. But he also knew the risks of allowing spoiled food to be distributed to the most desperate.",
      "\u201cOn that day, those mafiosi found themselves in front of a young man who, in the name of the Gospel, said \u2018No.\u2019 He opposed,\u201d his friend Aline Manani said. \"And Florib\u00e8rt, I think that for me personally, I would say for all young people, is a role model.\u201d",
      "Pope Francis recognized Kositi as a martyr of the faith late last year, setting him on the path to beatification and to possibly become Congo's first saint. The move fit into the pope\u2019s broader understanding of martyr as a social justice concept, allowing those deemed to have been killed for doing God\u2019s work and following the Gospel to be considered for sainthood.",
      "\u201cOur country almost holds the gold medal for corruption among the countries of the world,\" Goma Bishop Willy Ngumbi told reporters last week. \"Here, corruption is truly endemic. So, if we could at least learn from this boy\u2019s life that we must all fight corruption \u2026 I think that would be very important.\u201d",
      "Transparency International last year gave Congo one of the poorest marks on its corruption perception index, ranking it 163 out of 180 countries surveyed and 20 on the organization\u2019s 0-100 scale, with 0 highly corrupt and 100 very clean.",
      "The beatification has brought joy to Goma at a time of anguish. Violent fighting between government forces and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels has led to the death of thousands of people and the rebels\u2019 capture of the city has exacerbated what already was one of the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian crises.",
      "It has renewed the hopes of many in the country of more than 100 million people whose development has been stifled by chronic corruption, which Francis railed about during his 2023 visit to the country.",
      "Speaking at the Kinshasa stadium then, Francis said Kositi \u201ccould easily have turned a blind eye; nobody would have found out, and he might even have gotten ahead as a result. But since he was a Christian, he prayed. He thought of others and he chose to be honest, saying no to the filth of corruption.\u201d",
      "The Italian priest who spearheaded Kositi\u2019s sainthood case, the Rev. Francesco Tedeschi, knew him through their work with the Saint'Egidio Community. He broke down Saturday as he recounted Kositi's example and Francis' call for the church to recognize the ordinary holiness in the \u201csaints next door.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the end, this was what Floribert was, because he was just a boy,\u201d Tedeschi said as he began weeping.",
      "At Goma\u2019s Floribert Bwana Chui School of Peace, which is named in honor of Kositi and advocates for social justice, his beatification is encouraging everyone who sees him as a role model, school director Charles Kalimba told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson for every generation, for the next generation, for the present generation and for all people. Floribert\u2019s life is a positive point that must be presented to the Congolese nation. We are in a country where corruption is almost allowed, and this is a challenge that must be taken up,\u201d Kalimba said.",
      "Rev. Tedeschi said the martyr designation recognized Kositi died out of hatred for the faith, because his decision to not accept the spoiled food was inspired by the Christian idea of the dignity of everyone, especially the poor.",
      "Being declared a martyr exempts Kositi from the requirement that a miracle must be attributed to his intercession before he is beatified, thereby fast-tracking the process to get to the first step of sainthood. The Vatican must, however, confirm a miracle attributed to his intercession for him to be canonized, a process that can take years or more.",

      "Inclusion on the \u201cstrategic high-tech commodities\u201d list means Taiwanese companies will need to obtain export permits before selling goods to the respective companies. Other entities on the list include organizations such as the Taliban and al-Qaeda, as well as other companies in China, Iran and elsewhere.",
      "The export control entities list was last updated on Sunday. Neither Huawei nor SMIC initially commented on their inclusion.",
      "Huawei and SMIC have both been sanctioned by the U.S. The two companies are producing China\u2019s most advanced homegrown artificial intelligence chips in an effort to compete with U.S.-based Nvidia and supply Chinese tech firms with the much-needed chips amid export curbs.",
      "Taiwan is home the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), a major supplier for Nvidia.",
      "Last November, the U.S. ordered TSMC to halt supplies of certain advanced chips to Chinese customers as part of broader efforts to restrict China\u2019s access to cutting-edge technologies.",
      "China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary. The U.S. is Taiwan's biggest unofficial ally and arms seller.",

      "Water guns are back squirting at unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona.",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Protesters used water pistols against unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona on Sunday as demonstrators marched to demand a re-think of an economic model they believe is fueling a housing crunch and erasing the character of the Spanish city.",
      "\u201cThe squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\u201d Andreu Mart\u00ednez said with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor cafe. \u201cBarcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\u201d",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaudi\u2019s La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \u201cbubble tea\u201d spots.",
      "\u201cOur lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, is coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\u201d",
      "Similar demonstrations against tourism are slated in several other Spanish cities on Sunday, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal\u2019s capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "In Barcelona, protesters blew whistles and chanted, \u201cEverywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\u201d They held up homemade signs saying \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident\u201d and \u201cYour Airbnb was my home.\u201d They stuck stickers saying \u201cCitizen Self-Defense,\u201d in Catalan, and \u201cTourist Go Home,\u201d in English, with a drawing of a water pistol on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protestors as he slammed the hostel\u2019s doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona\u2019s main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but she said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit (28.3 degrees Celcius) weather.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s lovely, thank you sweetheart,\u201d Wanda said to the squirter. \u201cI am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\u201d",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "Spaniards have also staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles: When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. Spain\u2019s official public opinion office said 76% of people responded \u201cYes\u201d last year when asked if they were in favor of tighter government regulations on tourist apartments. (Those polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spain\u2019s municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Last month, Spain\u2019s government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "And last year, Barcelona stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb\u2019s general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn\u2019t trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn\u2019t resonating.",
      "But Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn\u2019t just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",
      "The government measures were not enough to keep Sunday\u2019s marchers at home in Barcelona.",

      "Gang violence, death threats and a crumbling judicial system have stalled an ongoing investigation defined by outbursts and tense exchanges between suspects and judges.",
      "\u201cYou failed in your mission. And you are not ashamed to declare yourself innocent,\u201d Judge Claude Jean said in a booming voice as he stood and faced a Haitian policeman responsible for protecting the president, who was shot 12 times in Port-au-Prince on July 7, 2021.",
      "Jean is one of six Haitian judges investigating whether there is enough evidence to warrant a trial for the 20 suspects held in the troubled Caribbean country. Authorities said some of the suspects envisioned a coup, not an assassination, leading to lucrative contracts under a new administration.",
      "The suspects include 17 former soldiers from Colombia and three Haitian officials: an ex-mayor, a former policeman and a former Haiti Ministry of Justice employee who worked on an anti-corruption unit. Missing are several key Haitian suspects who escaped last year after a powerful gang federation raided Haiti\u2019s two biggest prisons, including Dimitri H\u00e9rard, ex-head of security at Haiti's National Palace.",
      "Three other suspects, all Colombians, were killed hours after Mo\u00efse was slain, while a key suspect in the case, Haitian Superior Court Judge Windelle Coq Th\u00e9lot, died in January while still a fugitive.",
      "The investigation was repeatedly halted by the resignation of judges who feared for their lives. Defense attorneys then appealed after the court ruled there was sufficient evidence for trial. Jean and five other judges are now tasked with restarting the inquiry. But determining complicity among 51 suspects is only one of numerous challenges.",
      "Last year, powerful gangs seized control of the downtown Port-au-Prince courthouse where the judges were interrogating suspects. The hearings were suspended until the government rented a home in Pacot, a neighborhood once considered safe enough for the French embassy. But gangs controlling 85% of Haiti\u2019s capital recently attacked and forced the government to move again.",
      "The hearings restarted in May, this time in a private home in P\u00e9tion-Ville, a community trying to defend itself from gangs seeking full control of Port-au-Prince.",
      "As a fan swirled lazily in the background, Judge Phemond Damicy grilled Ronald Guerrier in late May.",
      "One of several police officers tasked with protecting the president, Guerrier insisted he never entered Mo\u00efse\u2019s home and couldn\u2019t fight the intruders because he was dazed by a stun grenade.",
      "\u201cThe attackers were dressed all in black. They wore balaclavas and blinded us with their flashlights. I couldn\u2019t identify anyone,\u201d Guerrier testified, adding they used a megaphone to claim they were U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents. \u201cThe attackers operated as if they were entering their own home. It seemed they knew the place perfectly.\u201d",
      "Damicy asked if they shot at drones that Guerrier said were buzzing above the president\u2019s home.",
      "\u201cThe attackers covered the entire area with their fire,\u201d Guerrier replied. \u201cThere was nothing we could do.\u201d",
      "Damicy grew exasperated. \u201cUnder no circumstances should an enemy cross you with impunity to commit his crime,\u201d he said. \u201cIn your place, I would fire on the enemy. I would even die, if necessary.\u201d",
      "Inside the investigation\u2019s heavily guarded, stone-and-concrete headquarters in a leafy residential community, raised voices have dominated tense interrogations.",
      "One judge stood and thundered a question about a gun: \u201cOn the day of the death of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse, were you in possession of a Galil?\u201d",
      "In another outburst in March, a judge repeatedly pressed Joseph Badio, the former Ministry of Justice official who spent two years on the run, about his call to former Prime Minister Ariel Henry after the assassination. At the time, Henry had only been nominated as prime minister by Mo\u00efse.",
      "\u201cYou can say whatever you want with your mouth,\u201d Badio told the judge, who ordered him to sit as he rose while speaking. \u201cThere is no prohibition for me to communicate with anyone I want.\u201d",
      "The tension has carried over into interrogations of the Colombian suspects, who maintain they were hired by a Miami-based security firm to provide security for power and water treatment plants and diplomatic officials, as well as train Haitian police and soldiers.",
      "The Colombians have denied involvement, while their attorney, Nathalie Delisca, said there has been no presumption of innocence during the interrogations.",
      "\u201cThe treatment inflicted on the detainees was inhumane,\u201d she said, alleging mistreatment by authorities after their arrest.",
      "The former soldiers said they were beaten, threatened with death, forced to sign documents in a language they don\u2019t understand and barred from communicating with their lawyers and families for long stretches.",
      "\u201cI have been subjected to degrading treatment. I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture,\u201d Jheyner Alberto Carmona Flores said during a recent hearing.",
      "He spoke Spanish in a clear and loud voice, sometimes correcting an interpreter translating his testimony into French.",
      "\u201cI have no involvement because I don\u2019t know when or where the president was assassinated,\u201d Carmona Flores said, claiming he was summoned to provide security at the perimeter of Mo\u00efse\u2019s house and did not know the president had been fatally shot.",
      "While the case in Haiti has stalled, the U.S. has charged 11 extradited suspects, with five already pleading guilty to conspiring to kill Mo\u00efse.",
      "Five other suspects are awaiting trial, which is now scheduled for March 2026.",
      "They include Anthony \u201cTony\u201d Intriago, owner of Miami-based CTU Security, and Haitian-Americans James Solages, a key suspect, and Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a pastor, doctor and failed businessman who envisioned himself as Haiti\u2019s new leader.",
      "Mo\u00efse's widow, Martine Mo\u00efse, is expected to testify in the U.S. case. She was injured in the attack and accused by a Haitian judge of complicity and criminal association, which her attorneys deny.",
      "Court documents say the plan was to detain Jovenel Mo\u00efse and whisk him away, but changed after the suspects failed to find a plane or sufficient weapons. A day before Mo\u00efse died, Solages falsely told other suspects it was a CIA operation and the mission was to kill the president, the documents allege.",

      "Leaders of some of the world\u2019s biggest economic powers will arrive in the Canadian Rockies on Sunday for a Group of Seven summit shadowed by a widening war in the Middle East, and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s unresolved trade war with allies and rival...",
      "BANFF, Alberta -- Leaders of some of the world\u2019s biggest economic powers will arrive in the Canadian Rockies on Sunday for a Group of Seven summit overshadowed by a widening war across the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s unresolved trade war with allies and rivals alike.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran and Tehran\u2019s retaliation, which appeared to catch many world leaders unawares, is the latest sign of a more volatile world as Trump seeks to withdraw the U.S. from its role as world policeman.",
      "Speaking on a flight to Canada to attend the summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had discussed efforts to de-escalate the situation with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as other world leaders.",
      "Britain is sending Royal Air Force jets and other military reinforcements to the Middle East.",
      "\u201cWe do have longstanding concerns about the nuclear program Iran has. We do recognize Israel\u2019s right to self-defense, but I\u2019m absolutely clear that this needs to de-escalate. There is a huge risk of escalation for the region and more widely,\" Starmer said, adding he expected \u201cintense discussions\u201d would continue at the summit.",
      "As summit host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a joint statement, or communique, at the end of the meeting.",
      "With other leaders wanting to talk to Trump in an effort to talk him out of imposing tariffs, the summit risks being a series of bilateral conversations rather than a show of unity.",
      "Trump is the summit wild card. Looming over the meeting are Trump\u2019s inflammatory threats to make Canada the 51st state and take over Greenland. French President Emmanuel Macron is making a highly symbolic stop in Greenland on his way to Canada, meeting the Arctic territory\u2019s leader and Denmark\u2019s prime minister aboard a Danish helicopter carrier.",
      "Macron, who is one of the very few leaders to have known Trump during his first term, was the first European leader to visit the White House after Trump took office, emerging unscathed from the Oval Office encounter.",
      "But despite the two leaders\u2019 sporadic bromance, Macron\u2019s approach to Trump has failed to bear major results, with France caught up in the president\u2019s planned tariffs on the European Union.",
      "Nor did it bring any U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine despite Macron\u2019s efforts, together with Starmer, to build a coalition of nations that could deploy forces after any ceasefire with Russia, with the hope it would convince the Trump administration to provide backup.",
      "Trump is scheduled to arrive late Sunday in Kananaskis, Alberta. Bilateral meetings between other leaders are possible Sunday, but the summit program does not get underway until Monday.",
      "Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s sherpa of the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and veteran of six G7 summits, expects the heads of state to pivot discussion to devote more time to the war.",
      "\u201cLeaders can accommodate a discussion, perhaps even a statement,\u201d Boehm said. \u201cThe foreign policy agenda has become much larger with this.\u201d",
      "Leaders who are not part of the G7 but have been invited to the summit by Carney include the heads of state of India, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico and the UAE. Avoiding tariffs will continue to be top of mind.",
      "\u201cLeaders, and there are some new ones coming, will want to meet Donald Trump,\u201d Boehm said. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t like the big round table as much he likes the one-on-one.\u201d",
      "Bilateral meetings with the American president can be fraught as Trump has used them to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien told a panel this week that if Trump does act out, leaders should ignore him and remain calm like Carney did in his recent Oval Office meeting.",
      "\u201cHe tends to be a bully,\u201d Chr\u00e9tien said. \u201cIf Trump has decided to make a show to be in the news, he will do something crazy. Let him do it and keep talking normally.\u201d",
      "Starmer had a warm Oval Office meeting with the president in February, wooing Trump with an invitation for a state visit from King Charles III. Trump has praised the British prime minister, despite their political differences.",
      "Last month Britain and the U.S. announced they had struck a trade deal that will slash American tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum. It has yet to take effect, however, though British officials say they are not concerned the Trump administration might go back on its word.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempts to woo Trump have left him in an awkward position with Canada, the U.K.\u2019s former colony, close ally and fellow Commonwealth member. Starmer has also drawn criticism \u2014 especially from Canadians \u2014 for failing to address Trump\u2019s stated desire to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Asked if he has told Trump to stop the 51st state threats, Starmer told The Associated Press: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the precise conversations I\u2019ve had, but let me be absolutely clear: Canada is an independent, sovereign country and a much-valued member of the Commonwealth.\u201d",
      "The war in Ukraine will be on the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to attend the summit and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their bruising Oval Office encounter which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Starmer met with Carney in Ottawa before the summit for talks focused on security and trade, in the first visit to Canada by a British prime minister for eight years.",
      "German officials were keen to counter the suggestion that the summit would be a \u201csix against one\u201d event, noting that the G7 countries have plenty of differences of emphasis among themselves on various issues.",
      "\u201cThe only the problem you cannot forecast is what the president of the United States will do depending on the mood, the need to be in the news,\" said Chr\u00e9tien.",

      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivia's largest Andean religious festival has long inspired joyous revelry and offered a chance for the nation to forget about its perpetual political turmoil and escape into the world of its rich folklore.",
      "But this year on Saturday, Bolivians say the day of the Great Power, the beloved carnival dedicated to a 17th-century painting of Jesus Christ, reflects more than distracts from the country\u2019s spiraling economic and political crises.",
      "The typically exuberant crowd fell silent for a few moments on Saturday before the folk dance performance kicked off in the major city of La Paz, paying their respects to the victims of fierce clashes between protesters and police last Thursday that left six people dead, among them four police officers and two civilians.",
      "The second civilian, identified by protesters as a young student beaten by police, had been hospitalized and succumbed to his wounds on Saturday, just before the festival.",
      "After Bolivia's electoral tribunal disqualified former President Evo Morales, a leftist political titan who still wields influence in the country\u2019s tropical heartland, from running in Bolivia\u2019s August presidential election, his loyalists took to the streets to vent their outrage earlier this month.",
      "Many of them, both peaceful and violent, have reported being bruised and beaten by officers in recent days. The government sent military tanks to the streets of Llallagua, in central Bolivia.",
      "La Paz municipal authorities proposed postponing the festival, citing the \u201cpain of the Bolivian people.\" But organizers refused, pointing to the $68 million that was expected to be generated Saturday \u2013 a shot of stimulus into a sputtering economy now witnessing its worst crisis in 40 years.",
      "The annual festival, which takes place some eight weeks after Easter, was recognized by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee for displaying the nation's unique mix of Roman Catholic belief and Indigenous heritage.",
      "The ceremony pays tribute to what is believed to be a miraculous rendering of Jesus Christ \u2014 El Se\u00f1or del Gran Poder, or The Lord of the Great Power \u2014 that shows the Christian savior with Indigenous Andean features and outstretched arms.",
      "Dancing in the festival is a holy act of spiritual devotion as dancers pray for personal forgiveness and salvation. This year, however, many turned their prayers on a more immediate target.",
      "\"Devotees are asking for economic recovery, as well as for peace and unity among Bolivians in this time,\u201d said a priest leading the ceremony, Father Saul Mamani.",
      "Economic strain was visible at Saturday's giant party as participants pared down their usually elaborate costumes and masks and dancers traded their traditional gold jewelry for Chinese-made knock-offs.",
      "\u201cThe price of my costume went up by 60%,\" said dancer Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, 37. \u201cMany haven\u2019t been able to dance, almost half of my group didn\u2019t come.\"",
      "Organizers could only afford to hire some 70,000 dancers \u2014 some 20,000 fewer than last year \u2014 and scrapped their usual plans to invite regionally renowned musicians.",
      "Every year, one of La Paz\u2019s wealthy merchants, or \u201cqamiris,\" gets the expensive honor of paying more than anyone else for Gran Poder. This year, the unlucky merchant, Edgar Apaza, said he had been saving all year and his budget was still tighter than ever before.",
      "\u201cThe crisis is affecting everyone,\u201d Apaza said.",
      "Inflation in Bolivia over the first five months of 2025 hit 9.81%, the highest rate in more than a decade, according to official figures, fueling public protests over President Luis Arce's handling of the economy and leaving many Bolivians struggling to buy even the basics.",
      "Pl\u00e1cida Quispe, 73, an embroiderer at the festival Saturday, said there wasn't enough demand to sell her colorful costumes this year. She said she would rent her handiwork to participants instead.",
      "\u201cThere is no business,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to celebrate, but they cannot afford to pay the price.\u201d",

      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- At least 100 people have been killed in a gun attack on a village in Nigeria \u2019s north-central Benue state, Amnesty International Nigeria said Saturday.",
      "The attack took place between late Friday and the early hours of Saturday in Yelewata, a community in the Guma area of the state, the rights group said in a Facebook post.",
      "Dozens of people are still missing, and hundreds were injured and without adequate medical care, it added.",

      "Graphic videos and photographs on social media platforms showed what appeared to be corpses and burnt down houses in the aftermath of the attack.",
      "Udeme Edet, a spokesperson of the police in Benue, confirmed that an attack took place in Yelewata, but did not specify how many people were killed.",
      "While it remains unclear who was responsible for the killings, such attacks are common in Nigeria\u2019s northern region where local herders and farmers often clash over limited access to land and water.",
      "The farmers accuse the herders, mostly of Fulani origin, of grazing their livestock on their farms and destroying their produce. The herders insist that the lands are grazing routes that were first backed by law in 1965, five years after the country gained its independence.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- A palpable tension settled over an eerily quiet Tel Aviv on Saturday as residents anticipated another round of missiles to be fired from Iran, which is under intense attack from the Israeli military.",
      "Iran\u2019s retaliatory strikes late Friday \u2014 a barrage of drones and missiles mostly shot down by Israel's defenses \u2014 killed at least three people in the greater Tel Aviv area, and wounded dozens.",
      "Most stores and restaurants were closed the next day across the Mediterranean city, though some ice cream shops remained open. A smattering of people gathered with friends in parks, while staying close to public bomb shelters. Tel Aviv's beaches, normally packed, had fewer sunbathers.",
      "Uneasy Israelis huddled over their phones for updates about the escalating conflict with Iran, while still trying to go about their lives and enjoy a bit of sunshine.",
      "\u201cIt just feels very unknown,\u201d said Lindsay Schragen, an architect in Tel Aviv.",
      "After more than 20 months of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the conflict with Houthi rebels in Yemen \u2014 all with ties to Iran \u2014 Israelis are used to government requests for them to go to bomb shelters when sirens are activated.",
      "But those episodes usually last about 10 minutes, whereas conflict with the much more powerful Iranian army means attacks last significantly longer, requiring families to spend hours in bomb shelters. Still, many people expressed gratitude for Israel's early warning systems, including cellphone notifications, and the robust shelter infrastructure in the city.",
      "Schragen, who moved to Israel from New Jersey eight years ago, said it was difficult for her family and friends in the U.S. to understand how she spent the night dashing for a bomb shelter and then the next afternoon hanging with friends in the park.",
      "\u201cMy mom keeps calling me and asking if I\u2019m in the shelter, but no, I\u2019m here, outside,\u201d she said. \u201cSomehow we\u2019re able to preserve some normalcy.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, Israel has developed a sophisticated air defense system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure. Israeli leaders say the system isn\u2019t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.",
      "Israel's attack on Iran was much more intense and caused significantly more damage. Israel said its hundreds of strikes on Iran over the past two days killed a number of top generals, nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Iran\u2019s U.N. ambassador said 78 people were killed and more than 320 wounded.",
      "Israel said the surprise attack was necessary before Iran got any closer to building an atomic weapon. The Israeli attack threw into disarray talks between the United States and Iran over Tehran's rapidly developing nuclear program.",
      "As the Iranian attack ensued, hospitals across Israel moved intensive-care patients into underground parking lots converted for such emergencies.",
      "Sheba Medical Center, in Ramat Gan, has room for hundreds of patients in its underground facility east of Tel Aviv. Over the past 48 hours, the hospital has moved dozens of patients, including premature babies, into the protected underground area.",
      "\u201cI told my wife I never want my child to be born into such a reality,\u201d said Eliran Bar, the father of a three-week-old premature baby in the intensive care unit. \u201cI really hope it will end soon.\u201d",
      "Saturday was mostly quiet in Israel, though many people were preparing for another night of missiles.",
      "Shaun Katz, a 32-year-old lawyer from Tel Aviv, packed a bag with camping mattresses, water bottles, and bananagrams, his favorite game, to pass the time.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know how this goes on or how it plays out, but this may have been the best chance to neutralize the Iranian threat,\u201d Katz said. \u201cI usually would take the option to de-escalate, but I don\u2019t know if that option is on the table, and this may be the best chance we\u2019ve got to stop them from getting a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, though its uranium enrichment has reached near weapons-grade levels, according to the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency.",

      "SAN JOSE, Costa Rica -- Violeta Chamorro, an unassuming homemaker who was thrust into politics by her husband\u2019s assassination and stunned the world by ousting the ruling Sandinista party in presidential elections and ending Nicaragua \u2019s civil war, has died, her family said in a statement on Saturday. She was 95.",
      "The country\u2019s first female president, known as Do\u00f1a Violeta to both supporters and detractors, she presided over the Central American nation\u2019s uneasy transition to peace after nearly a decade of conflict between the Sandinista government of Daniel Ortega and U.S.-backed Contra rebels.",
      "At nearly seven years, Chamorro\u2019s was the longest single term ever served by a democratically elected Nicaraguan leader, and when it was over she handed over the presidential sash to an elected civilian successor \u2014 a relative rarity for a country with a long history of strongman rule, revolution and deep political polarization.",
      "Chamorro died in San Jose, Costa Rica, according to the family\u2019s statement shared by her son, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, on X.",
      "\u201cDo\u00f1a Violeta died peacefully, surrounded by the affection and love of her children and those who had provided her with extraordinary care, and now she finds herself in the peace of the Lord,\u201d the statement said.",
      "A religious ceremony was being planned in San Jose. Her remains will be held in Costa Rica \u201cuntil Nicaragua returns to being a Republic,\u201d the statement said.",
      "In more recent years, the family had been driven into exile in Costa Rica like hundreds of thousands of other Nicaraguans fleeing the repression of Ortega.",
      "Violeta Chamorro's daughter, Cristiana Chamorro, was held under house arrest for months in Nicaragua and then convicted of money laundering and other charges as Ortega moved to clear the field of challengers as he sought reelection.",
      "The Violeta Barrios de Chamorro Foundation closed its operations in Nicaragua in January 2021, as thousands of nongovernmental organizations have been forced to do since because Ortega has worked to silence any critical voices. It had provided training for journalists, helped finance journalistic outlets and defended freedom of expression.",
      "Born Violeta Barrios Torres on Oct. 18, 1929, in the southwestern city of Rivas, Chamorro had little by way of preparation for the public eye. The eldest daughter of a landowning family, she was sent to U.S. finishing schools.",
      "After her father\u2019s death in 1948, she returned to the family home and married Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, who soon became editor and publisher of the family newspaper, La Prensa, following his own father\u2019s death.",
      "He penned editorials denouncing the abuses of the regime of Gen. Anastasio Somoza, whose family had ruled Nicaragua for four decades, and was gunned down on a Managua street in January 1978. The killing, widely believed to have been ordered by Somoza, galvanized the opposition and fueled the popular revolt led by Ortega\u2019s Sandinista National Liberation Front that toppled the dictator in July 1979.",
      "Chamorro herself acknowledged that she had little ambition beyond raising her four children before her husband\u2019s assassination. She said she was in Miami shopping for a wedding dress for one of her daughters when she heard the news.",
      "Still, Chamorro took over publishing La Prensa and also became a member of the junta that replaced Somoza. She quit just nine months later as the Sandinistas exerted their dominance and built a socialist government aligned with Cuba and the Soviet Union and at odds with the United States amid the Cold War.",
      "La Prensa became a leading voice of opposition to the Sandinistas and the focus of regular harassment by government supporters who accused the paper of being part of Washington\u2019s efforts \u2014 along with U.S.-financed rebels, dubbed \u201cContras\u201d by the Sandinistas for their counterrevolutionary fight \u2014 to undermine the leftist regime.",
      "Chamorro later recounted bitter memories of what she considered the Sandinistas\u2019 betrayal of her husband\u2019s democratic goals and her own faith in the anti-Somoza revolution.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not praising Somoza\u2019s government. It was horrible. But the threats that I\u2019ve had from the Sandinistas \u2014 I never thought they would repay me in that way,\u201d she said.",
      "Chamorro saw her own family divided by the country\u2019s politics. Son Pedro Joaquin became a leader of the Contras, and daughter Cristiana worked as an editor at La Prensa. But another son, Carlos Fernando, and Chamorro\u2019s eldest daughter, Claudia, were militant Sandinistas.",
      "By 1990 Nicaragua was in tatters. The economy was in shambles thanks to a U.S. trade embargo, Sandinista mismanagement and war. Some 30,000 people had died in the fighting between the Contras and Sandinistas.",
      "When a coalition of 14 opposition parties nominated an initially reluctant Chamorro as their candidate in the presidential election called for February that year, few gave her much chance against the Sandinista incumbent, Ortega. Even after months of campaigning, she stumbled over speeches and made baffling blunders. Suffering from osteoporosis, a disease that weakens the bones, she broke her knee in a household fall and spent much of the campaign in a wheelchair.",
      "But elegant, silver-haired and dressed almost exclusively in white, she connected with many Nicaraguans tired of war and hardship. Her maternal image, coupled with promises of reconciliation and an end to the military draft, contrasted with Ortega\u2019s swagger and revolutionary rhetoric.",
      "\u201cI bring the flag of love,\u201d she told a rally shortly before the vote. \u201cHatred has only brought us war and hunger. With love will come peace and progress.\u201d",
      "She shocked the Sandinistas and the world by handily winning the election, hailing her victory as the fulfillment of her late husband\u2019s vision.",
      "\u201cWe knew that in a free election we would achieve a democratic republic of the kind Pedro Joaquin always dreamed,\u201d Chamorro said.",
      "Washington lifted trade sanctions and promised aid to rebuild the nation\u2019s ravaged economy, and by June the 19,000-strong Contra army had been disbanded, formally ending an eight-year war.",
      "Chamorro had little else to celebrate during her first months in office.",
      "In the two months between the election and her inauguration, the Sandinistas looted the government, signing over government vehicles and houses to militants in a giveaway that became popularly known as \u201cthe pinata.\u201d",
      "Her plans to stabilize the hyperinflation-wracked economy with free-market reforms were met with stiff opposition from the Sandinistas, who had the loyalty of most of the country\u2019s organized labor.",
      "Chamorro\u2019s first 100 days in power were marred by two general strikes, the second of which led to street battles between protesters and government supporters. To restore order Chamorro called on the Sandinista-dominated army, testing the loyalty of the force led by Gen. Humberto Ortega, Daniel Ortega\u2019s older brother. The army took to the streets but did not act against the strikers.",
      "Chamorro was forced into negotiations, broadening the growing rift between moderates and hardliners in her government. Eventually her vice president, Virgilio Godoy, became one over her most vocal critics.",
      "Nicaraguans hoping that Chamorro\u2019s election would quickly bring stability and economic progress were disappointed. Within a year some former Contras had taken up arms again, saying they were being persecuted by security forces still largely controlled by the Sandinistas. Few investors were willing to gamble on a destitute country with a volatile workforce, while foreign volunteers who had been willing to pick coffee and cotton in support of the Sandinistas had long departed.",
      "\u201cWhat more do you want than to have the war ended?\u201d Chamorro said after a year in office.",
      "Chamorro was unable to undo Nicaragua\u2019s dire poverty. By the end of her administration in early 1997, unemployment was measured at over 50 percent, while crime, drug abuse and prostitution \u2014 practically unheard of during the Sandinista years \u2014 soared.",
      "That year she handed the presidential sash to another elected civilian: conservative Arnoldo Aleman, who also defeated Ortega at the ballot.",
      "In her final months in office, Chamorro published an autobiography, \u201cDreams of the Heart,\u201d in which she emphasized her vision of forgiveness and reconciliation.",
      "\u201cAfter six years as president, she has broadened her definition of \u2018my children\u2019 to include all Nicaraguans,\u201d wrote a reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. \u201cSo even political opponents like Ortega are briefly criticized in one sentence, only to be generously forgiven in the next.\u201d",
      "After leaving office, Chamorro retired to her Managua home and her grandchildren. She generally steered clear of politics and created the Violeta Barrios de Chamorro Foundation.",
      "In 2011 it was revealed that she suffered from a brain tumor. In October 2018, she was hospitalized and said by family members to be in \u201cdelicate condition\u201d after suffering a cerebral embolism, a kind of stroke.",

      "The judge-led inquiry will have the power to summon witnesses.",
      "LONDON -- The British government announced Saturday it will hold a national inquiry into organized child sexual abuse, something it has long been pressured to do by opposition politicians \u2014 and Elon Musk.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he would accept a recommendation from an independent reviewer for a judge-led inquiry with the power to summon witnesses.",
      "Starmer said he would \u201clook again\u201d and hold a probe into what the press have dubbed \u201cgrooming gangs\u201d of men who prey on often young and vulnerable women.",
      "In some of the most high-profile cases to come to trial, the perpetrators were men of Pakistani heritage, and the issue has been taken up by right-of-center politicians including Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, and stoked by Musk, who took to his X platform to condemn Starmer over the issue.",
      "Musk criticized Starmer for not backing a national inquiry into the matter following a request from the local authority in the northern English town of Oldham, where police found girls under 18 were sexually exploited by groups of men in the 2000s and 2010s. Musk also alleged that Starmer failed to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England\u2019s chief prosecutor between 2008 and 2013, a charge that the prime minister vigorously denied.",
      "Because the cases in Oldham and similar ones in several other towns involved predominantly white girls abused by men largely from Pakistani backgrounds, the issue has been used to link child sexual abuse to immigration, and to accuse politicians of covering up the crimes out of a fear of appearing racist.",
      "A 2022 report into what happened in the northwest England town of Oldham between 2011 and 2014 found that children were failed by local agencies, but that there was no cover-up despite \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d that the far-right would capitalize on \u201cthe high-profile convictions of predominantly Pakistani offenders across the country.\u201d",
      "In January the government said it would support several local inquiries into child exploitation in cities where gangs of men were prosecuted. It had previously said there was no need for further investigations following a string of previous inquiries, both local and national.",
      "A seven-year inquiry was held under the previous Conservative government, but many of the 20 recommendations it made in 2022 \u2014 including compensation for abuse victims \u2014 have yet to be implemented.",
      "Starmer\u2019s government also asked Louise Casey, an expert on victim's rights and social welfare, to review previous findings. Her review has been submitted to the government but has not yet been published.",
      "\u201cI have never said we should not look again at any issue,\u201d Starmer said as he flew to Canada for a Group of Seven summit. \u201cI have wanted to be assured that on the question of any inquiry. That\u2019s why I asked Louise Casey who I hugely respect to do an audit.",
      "\u201cHer position when she started the audit was that there was not a real need for a national inquiry over and above what was going on. She has looked at the material she has looked at and she has come to the view that there should be a national inquiry on the basis of what she has seen.",
      "\u201cI have read every single word of her report and I am going to accept her recommendation.\u201d",
      "The main opposition Conservative Party offered a swift response.",
      "\u201cThose in authority deliberately covered up the systematic rape of thousands of girls as young as 10 because the perpetrators were mainly of Pakistani origin. They thought race relations were more important than protecting young girls,'' Conservative law and order spokesman Chris Philp said. \u201cThe truth must now come out and people in positions of authority responsible for the cover up held to account.''",

      "\u201cRussia\u2019s principled approach and interest in the settlement remain unchanged,\u201d Ushakov said.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A sharp rise in global oil prices following Israeli strikes on Iran will benefit Russia and bolster its military capabilities in the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday in comments that were under embargo until Saturday afternoon.",
      "Speaking to journalists in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said the surge in oil prices threatens Ukraine\u2019s position on the battlefield, especially because Western allies have not enforced effective price caps on Russian oil exports.",
      "\u201cThe strikes led to a sharp increase in the price of oil, which is negative for us,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThe Russians are getting stronger due to greater income from oil exports.\u201d",
      "Global oil prices rose as much as 7% after Israel and Iran exchanged attacks over the past 48 hours, raising concerns that further escalation in the region could disrupt oil exports from the Middle East.",
      "Zelenskyy said he planned to raise the issue in an upcoming conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cIn the near future, I will be in contact with the American side, I think with the president, and we will raise this issue,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy also expressed concern that U.S. military aid could be diverted away from Ukraine toward Israel during renewed tensions in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cWe would like aid to Ukraine not to decrease because of this,\u201d he said. \u201cLast time, this was a factor that slowed down aid to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s military needs have been sidelined by the United States in favor of supporting Israel, Zelenskyy said, citing a shipment of 20,000 interceptor missiles, designed to counter Iran-made Shahed drones, that had been intended for Ukraine but were redirected to Israel.",
      "\u201cAnd for us it was a blow,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you face 300 to 400 drones a day, most are shot down or go off course, but some get through. We were counting on those missiles.\u201d",
      "An air defense system, Barak-8, promised to Ukraine by Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu was sent to the U.S. for repairs but never delivered to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said.",
      "The Ukrainian president conceded that momentum for the Coalition of the Willing, a group of 31 countries which have pledged to strengthen support for Ukraine against Russian aggression, has slowed because of U.S. ambivalence over providing a backstop.",
      "\u201cThis situation has shown that Europe has not yet decided for itself that it will be with Ukraine completely if America is not there,\u201d he said.",
      "The offer of a foreign troop \u201creassurance force\u201d pledged by the Coalition of the Willing was still on the table \u201cbut they need a backstop, as they say, from America,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThis means that suddenly, if something happens, America will be with them and with Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian president also said the presence of foreign contingents in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee and allow Kyiv to make territorial compromises, which is the first time he has articulated a link between the reassurance force and concessions Kyiv is willing to make in negotiations with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt is simply that their presence gives us the opportunity to compromise, when we can say that today our state does not have the strength to take our territories within the borders of 1991,\u201d he said.",
      "But Europe and Ukraine are still waiting on strong signals from Trump.",
      "Without crushing U.S. sanctions against Russia, \u201cI will tell you frankly, it will be very difficult for us,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that it would then fall on Europe to step up military aid to Ukraine.",
      "In other developments, Russia repatriated more bodies of fallen soldiers in line with an agreement reached during peace talks in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, Russian officials said Saturday, cited by Russian state media. The officials said Ukraine did not return any bodies to Russia on Saturday.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War confirmed in a statement that Russia returned 1,200 bodies.",
      "Ukraine and Russia also exchanged another group of ill and severely wounded servicemen on Saturday, officials from both countries said, although the sides did not report the numbers.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post on X that the Ukrainian servicemen who returned were members of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service, and the State Transport Special Service.",
      "The first round of the staggered exchanges took place on Monday. The agreement to exchange prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers was the only tangible outcome of the June 2 Istanbul talks.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump held a 50-minute phone call Saturday to discuss both the escalating situation in the Middle East and Ukraine peace talks, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said.",
      "According to Ushakov, Putin told Trump about the implementation of the agreements during peace talks in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, including the exchange of prisoners of war.",

      "Continuing a renewed battlefield push along eastern and northeastern parts of the more than 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed Saturday that its troops captured another village in the Donetsk region, Zelenyi Kut. The Ukrainian military had no immediate comment on the Russian claim.",
      "Russia launched 58 drones and decoys at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, according to the Ukrainian air force, which said its air defenses destroyed 23 drones while another 20 were jammed. A 45-year-old man was killed when a Russian drone dropped explosives in the Kherson region on Saturday, Ukraine's Prosecutor General\u2019s Office said.",
      "Russia\u2019s defense ministry said it shot down 66 Ukrainian drones overnight.",
      "Attacks have continued despite discussions of a potential ceasefire in the war. During the June 2 talks in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators traded memorandums containing sharply divergent conditions that both sides see as nonstarters, making a quick deal unlikely.",

Or Wendy\u2019s buy one get one free deal on premium sandwiches through its app on Sunday? Or Burger King\u2019s buy one get one free deals on Whoppers through the app?",
      "It\u2019s true the offers aren\u2019t quite as broad as on Mother\u2019s Day.",
      "But the spending disparity with Mother's Day may be narrowing, according to the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics. The organizations forecast that a record-breaking $24 billion will be spent on Father\u2019s Day this year, surpassing the previous mark of $22.9 billion in 2023. They say consumers plan to spend an average of $199.38 on their dads and father figures this year.",
      "Of course, that still pales in comparison to this year's $259.04 average planned for moms, which totals about $34.1 billion, or $10.1 billion more than Father\u2019s Day spending. That is a 21% smaller gap than the $12.8 billion difference there was between Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day spending in 2023.",
      "Other studies disagree, though. RetailMeNot forecasts a $25 drop in spending for dads this year, down to about $232 per shopper, while moms get an average of $360 per shopper, up $43 this year.",

      "Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran and Tehran\u2019s retaliation, which appeared to catch many world leaders unawares, is the latest sign of a more volatile world as Trump seeks to withdraw the U.S. from its role as world policeman.",
      "Speaking on a flight to Canada to attend the summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had discussed efforts to de-escalate the crisis with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as other world leaders.",

      "\u201cWe do have longstanding concerns about the nuclear program Iran has. We do recognize Israel\u2019s right to self-defense, but I\u2019m absolutely clear that this needs to de-escalate. There is a huge risk of escalation for the region and more widely,\" Starmer said, adding he expected \u201cintense discussions\u201d would continue at the summit.",
      "As summit host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a joint statement, or communique, at the end of the meeting.",
      "With other leaders wanting to talk to Trump in an effort to talk him out of imposing tariffs, the summit risks being a series of bilateral conversations rather than a show of unity.",
      "Trump is the summit wild card. Looming over the meeting are his inflammatory threats to make Canada the 51st state and take over Greenland. French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Greenland on Sunday for a highly symbolic stop on his way to Canada, meeting the Arctic territory\u2019s leader and Denmark\u2019s prime minister aboard a Danish helicopter carrier.",
      "Macron's office said the trip to Greenland is a reminder that Paris supports principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders as enshrined in the U.N. charter.",
      "Macron, who is one of the very few leaders to have known Trump during his first term, was the first European leader to visit the White House after Trump took office, emerging unscathed from the Oval Office encounter.",
      "But despite the two leaders\u2019 sporadic bromance, Macron\u2019s approach to Trump has failed to bear major results, with France caught up in the president\u2019s planned tariffs on the European Union.",
      "Nor did it bring any U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine despite Macron\u2019s efforts, together with Starmer, to build a coalition of nations that could deploy forces after any ceasefire with Russia, with the hope it would convince the Trump administration to provide backup.",
      "Trump is scheduled to arrive late Sunday in Kananaskis, Alberta. Bilateral meetings between other leaders are possible Sunday, but the summit program does not get underway until Monday.",
      "Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s sherpa of the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and veteran of six G7 summits, expects the heads of state to pivot discussion to devote more time to the war.",

      "Leaders who are not part of the G7 but have been invited to the summit by Carney include the heads of state of India, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico and the UAE. Avoiding tariffs will continue to be top of mind.",
      "\u201cLeaders, and there are some new ones coming, will want to meet Donald Trump,\u201d Boehm said. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t like the big round table as much he likes the one-on-one.\u201d",
      "Bilateral meetings with the American president can be fraught as Trump has used them to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien told a panel this week that if Trump does act out, leaders should ignore him and remain calm like Carney did in his recent Oval Office meeting.",
      "\u201cHe tends to be a bully,\u201d Chr\u00e9tien said. \u201cIf Trump has decided to make a show to be in the news, he will do something crazy. Let him do it and keep talking normally.\u201d",
      "Starmer had a warm Oval Office meeting with the president in February, wooing Trump with an invitation for a state visit from King Charles III. Trump has praised the British prime minister, despite their political differences.",
      "Last month Britain and the U.S. announced they had struck a trade deal that will slash American tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum. It has yet to take effect, however, though British officials say they are not concerned the Trump administration might go back on its word.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempts to woo Trump have left him in an awkward position with Canada, the U.K.\u2019s former colony, close ally and fellow Commonwealth member. Starmer has also drawn criticism \u2014 especially from Canadians \u2014 for failing to address Trump\u2019s stated desire to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Asked if he has told Trump to stop the 51st state threats, Starmer told The Associated Press: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the precise conversations I\u2019ve had, but let me be absolutely clear: Canada is an independent, sovereign country and a much-valued member of the Commonwealth.\u201d",
      "The war in Ukraine will be on the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to attend the summit and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their bruising Oval Office encounter which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Starmer met with Carney in Ottawa before the summit for talks focused on security and trade, in the first visit to Canada by a British prime minister for eight years.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels, after President Donald Trump expressed alarm about the impact of aggressive enforcement, an official said Saturday.",
      "The move follows weeks of increased enforcement since Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of Trump's immigration policies, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump's second term.",

      "The shift suggests Trump's promise of mass deportations has limits if it threatens industries that rely on workers in the country illegally. Trump posted on his Truth Social site Thursday that he disapproved of how farmers and hotels were being affected.",
      "\u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d",
      "While ICE's presence in Los Angeles has captured public attention and prompted Trump to deploy the California National Guard and Marines, immigration authorities have also been a growing presence at farms and factories across the country.",
      "Farm bureaus in California say raids at packinghouses and fields are threatening businesses that supply much of the country\u2019s food. Dozens of farmworkers were arrested after uniformed agents fanned out on farms northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, which is known for growing strawberries, lemons and avocados. Others are skipping work as fear spreads.",
      "ICE made more than 70 arrests Tuesday at a food packaging company in Omaha, Nebraska. The owner of Glenn Valley Foods said the company was enrolled in a voluntary program to verify workers' immigration status and that it was operating at 30% capacity as it scrambled to find replacements.",
      "Tom Homan, the White House border czar, has repeatedly said ICE will send officers into communities and workplaces, particularly in \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that limit the agency's access to local jails.",

If we can\u2019t arrest them in community, we\u2019re going to increase work site enforcement operation. We\u2019re going to flood the zone.\u201d",

      "Senzo Mchunu, the country's top law enforcement official, spoke to police rescue teams that have been searching for missing people and recovering bodies in and around the town of Mthatha since the floods hit in the predawn hours of Tuesday.",
      "Mchunu said the floods were a tragedy but urged local residents to ignore what he called inaccurate reports spreading on social media that the disaster was caused by someone opening the sluice gates at a nearby dam, leading to water surging through communities. Mchunu said the Mthatha Dam in question did not have sluice gates.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday during a visit to Mthatha that authorities would investigate if there were any problems with the local dam that might have led to the tragedy.",
      "A wall of water 3-4 meters (10-13 feet) high in places flowed out of the river, the head of the provincial government said, washing away victims with parts of their houses and trapping others inside their homes.",
      "Ramaphosa partly attributed the rains and floods to climate change and said some of South Africa's coastal regions were now constantly vulnerable to weather-related disasters. More than 400 people died in flooding in and around South Africa's east coast city of Durban in 2022, which a study linked to climate change.",
      "The floods in the Mthatha area and a neighboring district caught many people unaware despite weather services issuing warnings last week that an extreme cold front was heading for the region, bringing heavy rains and gale-force winds.",
      "The largely rural region is one of the country's poorest and authorities said communities living in informal housing close to the river were especially vulnerable when it burst its banks. Authorities have been criticized for the rescue response but also for the state of the infrastructure in the area.",
      "Officials believe that people are still missing and the death toll could rise further as rescue teams have been searching through floodwater and damaged homes for nearly a week. One of the bodies retrieved on Saturday was that of a boy that rescuers believed was around 13 or 14 years old.",
      "Many children are among the dead, although authorities haven't given an exact count. Some of the victims were washed up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away from their homes by the floods.",

      "Nippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.",
      "Nippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "Trump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would as president have \u201ctotal control\u201d of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.",

      "BRUSSELS -- Less than two weeks before a NATO summit, Sweden and the Netherlands said Friday that they intend to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands.",
      "Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands on June 24-25, where they\u2019re due to agree a new defense spending target. He insists that Europe must look after its own security, while Washington focuses on China and its own borders.",
      "Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that \u201cSweden will reach a new NATO spending target to 5% of GDP, where at least 3.5% of GDP will be allocated towards core defense requirements to fulfill NATO\u2019s new capability targets.\"",
      "\u201cWe are in a specific geographical situation where we need to meet the future threats from Russia,\u201d Kristersson told reporters in Stockholm, standing alongside NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, NATO's 32 allies agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on their military budgets. But NATO\u2019s new plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investment of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "According to the most recent NATO figures, Sweden was estimated to have spent 2.25% of its GDP on defense last year. The Netherlands spent 2.06%, among 22 of the 32 allies who reached NATO\u2019s old benchmark.",

      "In landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, a new inland desert fish farm is growing barramundi \u2014 a tropical species native to Australia",
      "DATELAND, Ariz. -- Storks scatter, white against blue water, as Dan Mohring's pickup truck rumbles down the dirt road. He's towing a trailer full of ground-up beef, chicken, fish and nutrient bits behind him, ready to be shot out of a cannon into the ponds below.",
      "It's time to feed the fish.",
      "Mohring fires up the machine and the food flies out in a rainbow arc. Then the water comes alive. Hundreds of thrashing, gobbling barramundi wiggle their way to the surface, all fighting for a piece. Until, in a few months, they will become food themselves.",
      "In the desert of landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, Mainstream Aquaculture has a fish farm where it's growing the tropical species barramundi, also known as Asian sea bass, for American restaurants.",
      "Mainstream sees it as a sustainable alternative to ocean-caught seafood. They say chefs and conscious consumers like that the food has a shorter distance to travel, eliminating some of the pollution that comes from massive ships that move products around the world. And they and some aquaculture experts argue it's efficient to use the water twice, since the nutrient-rich leftovers can irrigate crops like Bermuda grass sold for livestock feed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of water,\u201d said Matt Mangan, head of Australia-based Mainstream\u2019s American business. \u201cWe want to be here in 20 years', 30 years' time.\u201d",
      "But some experts question whether growing fish on a large scale in an arid region can work without high environmental costs.",
      "That question comes down to what people collectively decide is a good use of water. In Arizona, some places manage water more aggressively than others. But the whole state is dealing with the impacts of climate change, which is making the region drier and water only more precious.",
      "The farm uses groundwater, not Colorado River water. It's a nonrenewable resource, and like mining, different people and industries have different philosophies about whether it should be extracted.",
      "\u201cAs long as groundwater is treated as an open resource in these rural parts of Arizona, they\u2019re susceptible to new industries coming in and using the groundwater for that industry,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University's Morrison Institute.",
      "Some scientists believe aquaculture can play a role in protecting wild ocean ecosystems from overfishing. And it might play at least a small role in smoothing any supply problems that result from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including those that send the U.S. about 80% of its seafood, per the United States Department of Agriculture.",
      "In the greenhouses at University of Arizona professor Kevin Fitzsimmons' lab in Tucson, tilapia circle idly in tanks that filter down into tubs full of mussels and floating patches of collard greens and lettuce. Fitzsimmons mentored the student who started the tilapia farm eventually bought by Mainstream about three years ago where they now raise barramundi.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think desert agriculture is going away,\" he said. \u201cObviously, we want to do it as water-efficient as possible.\"",
      "But not everyone agrees it's possible.",
      "\u201cArtificial ponds in the desert are stupid,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at ASU and director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative. He worried about heavy water losses to evaporation.",
      "Mangan says that evaporation hasn't been an issue so much as the loss of heat in the wintertime. That has required pumping more water since its warmth when it arrives at the surface helps keep the barramundi cozy. But Mangan says they've been improving pond design to retain heat better and have found, after the last year of research and development, that they can cut their water requirement by about half as a result.",
      "Plus, he argues, the water coming out of the fish ponds is \"essentially liquid fertilizer,\" and though it's slightly salty, they use it for crops that can tolerate it, like Bermuda grass dairy cows can eat.",
      "But that's supporting the cattle industry, which contributes more than its share of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, Famiglietti said.",
      "\u201cDoing two suboptimal things doesn't make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Purple flowers sprout alongside paddle wheels. Fish bones crunch underfoot. The faint odor of brackish water and ammonia catches in the breeze.",
      "Without groundwater, none of it would be possible.",
      "Some farmers in Arizona rely on water from the Colorado River, but many others use well water to irrigate crops like alfalfa for the dairy industry or the lettuce, cucumbers and melons shipped nationwide year-round.",
      "Arizona has seven areas around the state where groundwater is rigorously managed. Dateland doesn't fall into one of those, so the only rule that really governs it is a law saying if you land own there, you can pump a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of groundwater, said Rhett Larson, who teaches water law at ASU.",
      "What might be considered \u201creasonable\u201d depends from crop to crop, and there's really no precedent for aquaculture, an industry that hasn't yet spread commercially statewide.",
      "Using numbers provided by Mainstream, Porter calculated that the fish farm would demand a \u201cvery large amount\u201d of water, on par with a big ranch or potentially even more than some suburbs of Phoenix. And she noted that although the water use is being maximized by using it twice, it's still depleting the aquifer.",
      "When the company scoped out Arizona to expand, Mangan said they didn\u2019t see nearly the same kinds of regulations as back in Australia.",
      "As part of its growth strategy, Mainstream is also hoping to work with other farmers in the area so more can use nutrient-rich fish pond wastewater to produce hay. They say a few have expressed interest.",
      "The seafood industry needs to reduce its reliance on catching small wild fish to feed bigger farmed ones that humans eat, said Pallab Sarker, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies sustainability in the aquaculture industry. He said seabirds and mammals rely on small species like anchovies and mackerel commonly used in fish meal.",
      "\u201cWe should not rely on ocean fish to grow fish for aquaculture to meet the demand for humans,\u201d Sarker said.",
      "Mainstream gets its fish feed from two suppliers, Skretting and Star Milling, but Mangan and Mohring said they didn't know for certain where those suppliers got their base ingredients from.",
      "Fitzsimmons, of the University of Arizona, also pointed out that between pollution, overfishing and oceanfront development for recreation, the commercial fishing industry had already been facing problems. He doesn't think that Trump's moves this spring to open up marine protected areas for commercial fishing will improve that situation the way aquaculture could.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hunting and gathering from the ocean,\u201d Fitzsimmons said.",

      "Trading in New York is a long-held goal for JBS, which was founded 72 years ago and is now one of the world's largest meat companies. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. JBS is America\u2019s top beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",

      "JBS said a dual listing would give it broader access to investors and more competitive interest rates, which would help it finance its growth. It has also said a U.S. listing would subject it to more oversight from regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved JBS's planned listing last month.",
      "Still, the proposed listing has received significant pushback. Earlier this week, Mighty Earth, an environmental group, said it sent a letter to the NYSE board urging it to decline the listing. Mighty Earth contends that JBS is illegally profiting from deforested land in Brazil.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that JBS's shareholders reject the planned listing.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "JBS said the outcome showed shareholders were confident in the benefits a dual listing would bring.",

      "The lone survivor was a passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British national of Indian origin.",
      "Ramesh was thrown from the aircraft and walked to an ambulance, according to Dr. Dhaval Gameti, who treated Ramesh. The doctor told The Associated Press that Ramesh was disoriented, with multiple injuries, but that he seemed to be out of danger.",
      "Another medic said Ramesh told him that immediately after the plane took off, it began descending and suddenly split in two, throwing him out before a loud explosion.",
      "The airline said there were no other survivors among the 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Security camera footage verified by The Associated Press showed the plane taking off and then veering slightly to the side. It then drops into a downward glide, disappears briefly from sight and hits the ground.",
      "Moments later, a huge orange and black fireball appears, rising high into the air.",
      "At the crash site, the tail cone of the aircraft with damaged stabilizer fins still attached was lodged near the top of a building. The plane's jagged cavity has torn into the facade. A web of cracks spirals outward from the plane's impact.",
      "The battered building in Ahmedabad was the dining area for medical students, and they were having lunch when the plane crashed.",
      "Indrajeet Singh Solanki, an eyewitness and rescuer, said that at first it was chaotic, smoke everywhere.",
      "\"We could see some small parts (of the plane) burning. Just like this wing lying over here,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough the smoke, we kept rescuing injured people and rushed them to the trauma center in the civil hospital in auto rickshaws. We rushed nine people to the hospital.\u201d",
      "The airline had been plagued by tragedy and financial losses under prior state ownership.",
      "In 2010, an Air India flight arriving from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, overshot the runway in Mangalore, India, and plunged over a cliff, killing 158 of the 166 people on board.

      "The carrier was under government control from 1953 through 2022.",
      "The Boeing 787 went into service in 2009. This was the first crash of the model, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.",
      "The 787 Dreamliner was the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter, recharge faster and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. In 2013 the 787 fleet was temporarily grounded because of overheating of its lithium-ion batteries, which in some cases sparked fires.",
      "There was no information yet about possible causes of the crash. Authorities were searching the crash site Friday as part of the investigation, and there was no word whether the plane's black boxes \u2014 the flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2014 had been recovered.",

      "Canada is hosting a Group of Seven meeting that will include U.S. President Donald Trump, who is waging a trade war against America\u2019s allies",
      "TORONTO -- U.S. President Donald Trump will arrive Sunday for a Group of Seven summit in a country he has suggested should be annexed and as he wages a trade war with America\u2019s longstanding allies.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won his office by pledging to confront the U.S. president\u2019s increased aggression, now hosts the G7 summit.",
      "Carney asserted this week that Washington no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, imposing tariffs for access to its markets and reducing its contributions to collective security.",
      "Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a lengthy joint statement, or communiqu\u00e9, at the summit\u2019s conclusion as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the G7 summit in France in 2019.",
      "The document typically outlines the consensus reached by leaders on summit issues and provides a roadmap for how they plan to tackle them.",
      "Trump roiled the 2017 meeting in Italy over the climate change passage in that summit\u2019s final statement. He then withdrew his support from the 2018 communiqu\u00e9 after complaining he had been slighted by then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host that year.",
      "The leaders of the world's richest countries begin arriving Sunday in the resort town of Kananaskis, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies.",
      "The Group of Seven comprises Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and Britain. The European Union also attends as well as other heads of state who are not part of the G7 but have been invited by Carney.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their contentious Oval Office encounter, which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Other world leaders will be meeting with Trump both in a group setting and for bilateral talks, which are often precarious as foreign leaders must navigate between placating and confronting him.",
      "\u201cAnything could happen. The Canadians would be crazy not to anticipate something. We can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s Trump stock and trade. He likes to keep everyone guessing,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations.",
      "\u201cIt all depends what kind of theater he\u2019s going to want to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will attend and said she expects to have her first in-person meeting with Trump. On his way to Canada, Macron is making a notable stop in Greenland, the semi autonomous Danish territory that the U.S. president has also suggested annexing.",
      "Among the other newcomers are German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Starmer will meet with Carney on Saturday in Ottawa before flying to Alberta.",
      "Carney also invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite accusations from Canada's national police force that agents of Modi's government were involved in \u201cwidespread\u201d violence in Canada.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, was invited but will not attend.",
      "The 2018 G7 summit in Quebec was thrown into disarray after Trump called Trudeau \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak,\" while complaining that he had been blindsided by Trudeau\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s tariff threats at a summit-ending news conference. Trump pulled out of the G7 group statement just as it was released.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t too happy because we thought we managed to pull off a pretty good summit,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s deputy minister for the Quebec summit.\" The reaction \u2014 and I was with Mr. Trudeau at the time \u2014 was a bit of disbelief.\"",
      "Boehm expects a chair's summary from Carney this year instead of a joint statement from the leaders.",
      "During the Quebec summit, Trump also insisted on Russia's readmission to the elite group, from which it was ousted in 2014 following President Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea.",
      "\u201cTrump raised that at the foreign policy dinner,\" Boehm recalled. \u201cIt was a bit awkward because British Prime Minister Theresa May was there and some British citizens had just been killed by Russian operatives using a toxic agent.\u201d",
      "Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack a few months before the Quebec summit in the English city of Salisbury.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra has said that Carney has been quietly holding direct talks with Trump about a trade deal in the lead up to the summit. Separately, top Canadian cabinet ministers have also been in Washington for negotiations in recent weeks.",
      "Trade tensions may be unavoidable. The United States runs trade deficits with all G7 countries except the United Kingdom. In an effort to balance what he describes as America\u2019s lopsided trade relations, Trump has imposed 10% import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on almost every country in the world. He also announced bigger tariffs, then suspended them, on countries that sell more to the United States than they buy.",
      "\u201cThe big X Factor (is) the looming tariffs,\u201d said Max Bergmann of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe G7 is supposed to provide global economic governance. And the way the Europeans see it right now is that the country that\u2019s the source of major instability in global economic affairs is the United States.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump\u2019s trade wars are already threatening the world economy. The World Bank on Tuesday sharply downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year, citing \u201ca substantial rise in trade barriers.\u2019\u2019",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will attend the G7 meeting ahead of this month's NATO summit and has said most U.S. allies in the alliance endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs.",
      "Carney said this week Canada would meet NATO's current 2% target but seemed to suggest he would not support 5%, saying his goal is to protect Canadians, and not to satisfy NATO accountants.",
      "Law enforcement overseeing security expect large protests but say protesters won't be able to get anywhere near Kananaskis, as access roads to the summit will be closed to the public.",
      "The Mounties say there will be designated G7 demonstration zones in Calgary and Banff, Alberta that will have live audio and video feeds, which will be broadcast to G7 leaders and delegations at the summit. Kananaskis also hosted a G8 summit in 2002.",

There was no information on whether the black boxes \u2014 the flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2014 had been recovered.",
      "The plane hit a building hosting a medical college hostel and burst into flames, killing several students, in the city that is the capital of Gujarat, Modi\u2019s home state.",
      "\u201cWe are all devastated by the air tragedy in Ahmedabad. The loss of so many lives in such a sudden and heartbreaking manner is beyond words,\u201d Modi said on social media after visiting the site. \u201cWe understand their pain and also know that the void left behind will be felt for years to come.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Phuket International Airport in southern Thailand said Friday it received a report that a pilot of Air India flight AI 379, which was bound for New Delhi, found a bomb threat message shortly after the morning flight took off.",
      "The plane requested an emergency landing back at Phuket and all 156 passengers were evacuated before authorities began an inspection of the plane, the airport said. The inspection results were not immediately announced.",
      "The survivor was seen in television footage meeting Modi at the government hospital where he was being treated for burns and other injuries.",
      "Viswashkumar Ramesh told India's national broadcaster he still can\u2019t believe he was alive. He said the aircraft seemed to become stuck immediately after takeoff. He said then the lights came on, and right after that it accelerated but seemed unable to gain height before it crashed.",
      "He said the side of the plane where he was seated fell onto the ground floor of a building and there was space for him to escape after the door broke open. He unfastened his seat belt and forced himself out of the plane.",
      "\u201cWhen I opened my eyes, I realized I was alive,\u201d he said.",
      "India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is investigating, and the U.S. participants in the probe are expected to include people from the National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and General Electric.",
      "Medics are conducting DNA tests to identify those killed, the president of the Federation of All India Medical Association, Akshay Dongardiv, said. Meanwhile, grieving families gathered outside the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad on Friday.",
      "Two doctors at the hospital said the bodies of four medical students killed on the ground after the plane crash were handed to their families. They said at least 30 other injured students were still admitted in the hospital and at least four of them were critical.",
      "Modi held a meeting with senior officials Friday and met some of those injured on the ground during the hospital visit.",
      "Thursday\u2019s Air India crash involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft.",
      "According to experts, there are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation.",
      "Indian conglomerate Tata Sons took over Air India in 2022, returning the debt-saddled national carrier to private ownership after decades of government control. Since the takeover, Air India has ordered hundreds of new planes, redesigned its branding and livery and absorbed smaller airlines Tata held stakes in.",
      "Residents living in the vicinity, who were among the first to rush to the crash site and help with rescue, described the scale of damage like they had never seen.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,045.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% to 42,967.62, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.2% to 19,662.48.",

      "Stocks broadly got some help from easing Treasury yields in the bond market following the latest update on inflation. Thursday\u2019s update said inflation at the wholesale level wasn\u2019t as bad last month as economists expected, and it followed a report on Wednesday saying something similar about the inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling.",
      "Wall Street took it as a signal that the Federal Reserve will have more leeway to cut interest rates later this year in order to give the economy a boost.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been hesitant to lower interest rates, and it\u2019s been on hold this year after cutting at the end of last year, because it\u2019s waiting to see how much President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs  will hurt the economy and raise inflation. While lower rates can goose the economy by encouraging businesses and households to borrow, they can also accelerate inflation.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.35% from 4.41% late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80% early this year.",
      "Besides the inflation data, a separate report on jobless claims also helped to weigh on Treasury yields. It said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week than economists expected, and the total number remained at the highest level in eight months. That could be an indication of a rise in layoffs.",
      "The Fed\u2019s next meeting on interest rates is scheduled for next week, but the nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will stand pat again. Traders are betting it\u2019s likely to begin cutting in September, according to data from CME Group.",
      "Trump\u2019s on-and-off tariffs have raised worries about higher inflation and a possible recession, which had sent the S&P 500 roughly 20% below its record a couple months ago. But stocks have since rallied nearly all the way back on hopes that Trump will lower his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries.",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s tariffs are on hold at the moment to give time for negotiations, but Trump added to the uncertainty late Wednesday when he suggested the United States could send letters to other countries at some point \u201csaying this is the deal. You can take it or you can leave it.\u201d",

      "Meta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant.",
      "The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.",
      "Meta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.",
      "Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.",
      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",
      "It hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d",
      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just that now we have a clearer vision for how to accomplish this,\u201d he said.",

      "Fergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research \u201cremains unwavering\u201d and described the work as \u201cbuilding human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.\u201d",

      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",
      "Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.",
      "\u201cIt's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve now taken that to send me political texts.\u201d",
      "CVS sent messages to \u201clarge numbers\" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.",
      "Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information \u201cfor their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,\u201d Murrill told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not why anybody gave them their phone number.\u201d",
      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",
      "The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee \u2014 a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",
      "\u201cCVS \u2026 you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.",
      "Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.",
      "\u201cYes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,\" Landry said a statement. \"It\u2019s that important.\u201d",

    "summary": "China has approved &ldquo;a certain number&rdquo; of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday",
    "story": [
      "China has approved \u201ca certain number\u201d of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The high-level negotiations over China's export controls of rare earths is giving U.S. businesses some relief, even though it may be only for now.",
      "China has approved \u201ca certain number\u201d of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry said on Thursday, one day after U.S. President Donald Trump declared that Beijing would supply to the U.S. companies those key elements and the magnets made from them following a two-day trade talk in London.",
      "\u201cI will be one of the happiest people out there if, if in fact, China starts to, to release some of those heavy rare earths and allows them to get into the world economy because the world economy is going to shut down without those heavy rare earths,\u201d said Mark Smith, chief executive officer of NioCorp., which is developing a new mine in Nebraska to produce niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths.",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, after China imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to halt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Negotiators from the two governments said they reached a framework to move forward, with details yet to be agreed to by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, but businesses welcomed the developments, even though uncertainties persist.",
      "Rare earth elements are some of the most sought-after critical minerals. Despite the name, they aren't actually rare, but it is hard to find them in high enough concentrations to make mining them economical. They are also difficult to extract from the ore, and China over the past several decades has built dominance in the processing capacity, supplying nearly 90% of the world's rare earths.",
      "In the heat of the tariff war with Trump, Beijing on April 4 announced permitting requirements for seven heavy rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "The elements China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium, are key ingredients needed to make permanent rare earth magnets withstand high temperatures. That is crucial for a variety of uses in electric vehicles, wind turbines and military uses like jet engines and nuclear submarines.",
      "Some of the other rare earths needed for those magnets are produced at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine run by MP Materials in California, but China remains the only source of nearly all of what\u2019s known as the heavy rare earths. MP Materials previously sent the heavy rare earths that it mines to China for processing but it halted that in April amid the tariffs. The company is working to expand its own processing capability as soon as possible, and it is building a new magnet plant in Texas.",
      "Neha Mukherjee, rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, had previously predicted that most companies wouldn\u2019t start to run short of rare earths until later this year, but it appears some companies already have problems.",
      "\u201cThe overall market stockpile exists, but looks like a lot of OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), especially auto manufacturers, were not prepared, especially in Europe,\u201d Mukherjee said. Some American companies have stockpiled, but they \u201cmight start experiencing constraint if this continues.\u201d",
      "\u201cLooks like most of the stockpile is still in China hence the bottleneck in supply,\u201d Mukherjee said.",
      "On June 4, the European Association of Automotive Supplies said the industry was \u201calready experiencing significant disruption\u201d due to China\u2019s export restrictions on rare earths and magnets. \u201cThese restrictions have led to the shutdown of several production lines and plants across Europe, with further impacts expected in the coming weeks as inventories deplete,\u201d the group said.",
      "Details are still scarce on any agreement on rare earths shipments from China.",
      "On Thursday, He Yadong, spokesman for the Chinese commerce ministry, said China will \u201csufficiently consider the reasonable needs and concerns by all countries in the civilian field\" in reviewing applications of export permits for rare earths and related items.",
      "He said that it is consistent with international practice to put export controls on rare earths because they can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",
      "In a note, Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, wrote that even though there is an agreement for now, \u201csupply cutoffs will remain an ever-present threat.\u201d That's because China\u2019s licensing regime for the export of the seven heavy rare earths and related magnets is permanent, despite perceptions at the time that it was an act of retaliation, he wrote.",
      "China \"will probably not approve exports in sufficient quantity to allow U.S. customers to stockpile, ensuring that Beijing\u2019s leverage remains undiminished,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBeijing may approve few if any exports to U.S. defense companies and their suppliers.\u201d",
      "Smith of NioCorp. said even if the Chinese are offering a reprieve from their restrictions on rare earths, they will likely still keep limits in place on U.S. military uses.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m in the military and flying a jet or running a nuclear class submarine or a guided missile, I don\u2019t want that to fail because of high temperatures. So we have to have these heavy rare earths,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith said he hopes to find a solution to the problem of America being almost entirely dependent on China for these elements.",
      "\u201cI sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart that we use this situation as our final learning,\" Smith said. \u201cLet\u2019s take care of what we know needs to be taken care of.\u201d",

      "The Republican tax bill approved by the House would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican tax bill approved by the U.S. House of Representatives would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Middle-income households would see a boost of roughly $500 to $1,000 per year under Republican President Donald Trump's tax bill, the CBO found.",
      "The cuts to the lowest-income households come from proposed cuts to social safety net programs including Medicaid and a food assistance program for lower-income people, known as Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program.",
      "The bill also proposes expanding work requirements to receive food aid and new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents to receive Medicaid. Some proposed tax breaks would be temporary, including a tax break on tips and overtime, car loan interest and a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other Republicans have sought to discredit the CBO's analyses of the bill and say that the U.S. could head toward economic catastrophe if the measure is not passed. GOP Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday that the tax bill \"recognizes the solution to our debt crisis is not to tax Americans more, it is to spend less.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe legislation recognizes that extending proven tax reform is critical for working families,\" he said.",
      "Administration officials have said the the cost of the tax bill would be offset by tariff income. Recently, the CBO separately estimated that Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.",
      "The CBO was established more than 50 years ago to provide objective, impartial analysis to support the budget process. It is required to produce a cost estimate for nearly every bill approved by a House or Senate committee and will weigh in earlier when asked to do so by lawmakers.",
      "The office's analysis released Thursday considers Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d in isolation, excluding the potential impact of the tariffs that Trump has imposed and paused on nations around the world.",
      "Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, who requested the CBO analysis released Thursday, said in a statement that \"this would be one of the largest transfers of wealth from working families to the ultra-rich in American history. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d",

The runway lights weren't working at that airport. Six more people died earlier this week when a small plane crashed into the ocean shortly after taking off in San Diego.",
      "\u2014 The New York helicopter that crashed on April 10 departed a downtown heliport. The flight lasted less than 18 minutes. Radar data shows the helicopter flew north along the Manhattan skyline, then south toward the Statue of Liberty. The victims in this crash included a family from Spain who was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children.",

      "\u2014 A small commuter plane crashed in Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed. The U.S. Coast Guard was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft.",
      "\u2014 A medical transport plane that had just taken off plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in late January, killing all six people on board and two people on the ground. About two dozen people were also hurt. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control.",
      "\u2014 The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January.

All but two of the 181 people aboard were killed in one of that country\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "\u2014 The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations after taking off in Colorado Springs. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries. The NTSB found a fuel leak and several improperly installed parts in the engine.",

      "\u2014 A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries. Witnesses and video from the scene showed the plane landing so hard that its right wing was sheared off. Investigators said when trying to determine the cause, they would consider the weather conditions and the possibility of human error.",
      "\u2014 Last month, two commercial planes had to abort their landings at Reagan National Airport near Washington because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter flying near the Pentagon. The Army suspended all its helicopter flights in the area after this incident.

      "The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro\u2019s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.",
      "The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing \u2014 also known as all-wing or blended-wing \u2014 Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.",

      "United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.",

      "The 5-year-old company says the plane\u2019s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.",
      "JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.",

Unions and advocacy organizations have sued to block DOGE\u2019s access to the information.",
      "The IRS was one of the highest-profile agencies still without a Senate-confirmed leader. Before Long\u2019s confirmation, the IRS shuffled through four acting leaders, including one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "After leaving Congress to mount an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, Long worked with a firm that distributed the pandemic-era employee retention tax credit. That tax credit program was eventually shut down after then-IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel determined that it was fraudulent.",
      "Democrats called for a criminal investigation into Long\u2019s connections to other alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits.",
      "Long appeared before the Senate Finance Committee last month and denied any wrongdoing related to his involvement in the tax credit scheme.",
      "Ahead of the confirmation vote, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles blasting the requisite FBI background check conducted on Long as a political appointee as inadequate.",
      "\u201cThese issues were not adequately investigated,\u201d Wyden wrote. \u201cIn fact, the FBI\u2019s investigation, a process dictated by the White House, seemed designed to avoid substantively addressing any of these concerning public reports. It\u2019s almost as if the FBI is unable to read the newspaper.\u201d",
      "Democratic lawmakers have also written to Long and his associated firms detailing concerns with what they call unusually timed contributions made to Long\u2019s defunct 2022 Senate campaign committee shortly after Trump nominated him.",
      "The IRS faces an uncertain future under Long. Tax experts have voiced concerns that the 2026 filing season could be hampered by the departure of so many tax collection workers. In April, The Associated Press reported that the IRS planned to cut as many as 20,000 staffers \u2014 up to 25% of the workforce. An IRS representative on Thursday confirmed the IRS had shed about that many workers but said the cuts amounted to approximately the same number of IRS jobs added under the Biden administration.",
      "The fate of the Direct File program, the free electronic tax return filing system developed during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, is also unclear. Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies had complained it was a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use. Long said during his confirmation hearing that it would be one of the first programs that come up for discussion if he were confirmed.",
      "Long is not the only Trump appointee to support dismantling an agency he was assigned to manage.",
      "Linda McMahon, the current education secretary, has repeatedly said she is trying to put herself out of a job by closing the federal department and transferring its work to the states. Rick Perry, Trump's energy secretary during his first term, called for abolishing the Energy Department during his bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.",

      "President Donald Trump signed a resolution on Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a resolution on Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California's attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump's signing ceremony ended at the White House.",
      "The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "Trump called California\u2019s regulations \u201ccrazy\u201d at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a disaster for this country,\u201d he said.",
      "It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state's Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe federal government\u2019s actions are not only unlawful; they\u2019re irrational and wildly partisan,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cThey come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.\u201d",
      "The three resolutions Trump signed will block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.",
      "\u201cI like Tesla,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed \u201care killing our country,\u201d the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he'd risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take electrocution every single day,\" the president said.",
      "When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, \u201cIf you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat this does is it gives us freedom,\u201d said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install \u201cinfrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn\u2019t give you any return.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump\u2019s action.",
      "\u201cEveryone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,\u201d John Bozzella, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Newsom said Trump\u2019s action was a continuation of his \u201call-out assault\u201d on California.",
      "\u201cAnd this time he\u2019s destroying our clean air and America\u2019s global competitiveness in the process,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cWe are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.\u201d",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.",
      "Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was \u201cTrump\u2019s latest betrayal of democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cSigning this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people\u2019s health and their wallets,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",
      "That\u2019s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California\u2019s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.",
      "California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.",

      "The ratings are down for these NBA Finals, as was expected",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The ratings are down for these NBA Finals, as was expected. Oklahoma City vs. Indiana is a small-market series and the numbers reflect that, with viewership down about 20% from last season and on pace for the poorest TV turnout since the pandemic \u201cbubble\u201d finals in 2020.",
      "Don't blame the Thunder and Pacers for that.",
      "It's been a back-and-forth over the first four games \u2014 and now, a best-of-three will decide the NBA title. Game 5 is in Oklahoma City on Monday night, with the Thunder trying to take their first lead of the series and the Pacers trying to head back home one win away from a championship.",
      "\u201cI do not care, to be honest with you,\" Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton said when asked what he'd say to those who, for whatever reason, haven't tuned into the series. \u201cThis is high-level basketball and I'm excited to be a part of it.\u201d",
      "Game 1 had a frantic Indiana comeback and a Haliburton buzzer-beater. Game 2 saw Oklahoma City do what it has done in the majority of games all season: take full control early and roll to a win. Game 3 in Indiana had the Pacers' bench fueling a win. And Game 4 saw the MVP do MVP things, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scoring 15 points in the final five minutes to carry the Thunder to a comeback win.",
      "Add it up, and it's Thunder 2, Pacers 2. The Thunder are outscoring the Pacers by 3.3 points per game; the Pacers are outshooting the Thunder by 1.4%. It's only the third time in the last 15 years that the finals have had all that through four games \u2014 2-2 tie, 3.3-point differential or less, shooting within 1.4% of each other. Golden State-Boston had it in 2022, and Dallas-Miami had it in 2011.",
      "It all seems pretty even, and the looks aren't deceiving.",
      "\u201cIt's good for y\u2019all,\" Thunder guard Alex Caruso said. \u201cGood for me, we\u2019d be getting ready for a parade right now.\u201d",
      "Parades in Indianapolis or Oklahoma City are going to have to wait at least until this coming weekend. This series seems like it could have debunked some of the tired complaints about the game in recent years: the nobody-plays-defense, too-much-isolation, too-many-3s arguments that have been out there.",
      "\u201cI think from an outside perspective it\u2019s great for the league,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for basketball. I think these two teams play stylistically the best versions of basketball right now as far as pressure and being influencing and aggressive on defense \u2014 causing turnovers, making stuff hard and then offensively free-flowing, shot making, passing the ball. ... A great brand of basketball.\u201d",
      "And that means it could end up as a great finals, whether more people start watching or not.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to play this deep into the season,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing this deep into the season, your opponent is going to be really good. They have won 12 games to get to this point just like we have. You just know it\u2019s going to be an unbelievable level. There are definitely times in it where (you're saying), \u2018Man, this is a high, high level.\u2019\"",
      "This marks the 32nd time that a finals has been 2-2 going into Game 5. The winner of Game 5 has gone on to ultimately prevail in 23 of the 31 previous occasions.",
      "\u201cWe are both two games away,\" Haliburton said. \u201cAnything can happen here.\u201d",

I\u2019ve been watching him since 2017. I think last year, we started communicating. I\u2019m in awe with everything that goes on with him because it\u2019s (Shohei) Ohtani and Judge.

      "MIAMI GARDENS -- After more than a year of uncertainty and criticism, the Club World Cup kicked off in Miami on Saturday and soccer may never be the same.",
      "At least that's what FIFA president Gianni Infantino has been telling anyone who would listen.",
      "\u201cThis tournament will be the start of something historic that will change our sport for the better,\u201d he said this week as part of an exhausting schedule of public engagements to drum up interest in the month-long event staged across 11 cities in the United States.",
      "Soccer's newest tournament is what the sport has been waiting for, Infantino says, and on Saturday, despite considerable pushback and obstacles, he turned his personal passion project into a reality.",
      "The Swiss lawyer, who holds one of the most powerful positions in the world as head of soccer's governing body, was on hand at a largely full Hard Rock Stadium to watch Lionel Messi's Inter Miami draw 0-0 with Egyptian team Al Ahly in the opening game of his super-sized Club World Cup.",
      "The match may have been underwhelming, but the occasion \u2014 kicked off with a lavish opening ceremony featuring music, dance routines and fireworks \u2014 was a moment of immense pride for Infantino and conclusive proof of his influence over the most popular sport on the planet.",
      "Despite his assertions, it's not clear how much soccer really wanted another elite tournament. But this was his baby \u2014 so much so that his name is etched not once, but twice, onto a giant golden trophy crafted by Tiffany & Co. that will be lifted by the winner on July 13.",
      "It has gone ahead against the backdrop of legal challenges in Europe, threats of strike action from players and fears of injury and burnout for the biggest stars.",
      "There have been concerns about overreach by FIFA - which has traditionally focused on national team soccer \u2014 and the detrimental impact a new club competition would have on domestic leagues.",
      "But nothing was going to stand in the way of Infantino's plans to expand the Club World Cup from its previous guise as a seven-team mid-season mini tournament to a 32-team extravaganza that could one day rival the Champions League and Premier League as one of the most popular and wealthiest competitions in the world.",
      "Time will tell if it lives up to Infantino's billing, but he has navigated the biggest hurdle of all by getting this inaugural edition off the ground.",
      "It is locked into the calendar \u2014 every four years \u2014 and teams such as Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain have already qualified for the next edition in 2029.",
      "\"Maybe not now in its first edition, but it will become an incredibly important competition to win,\u201d PSG coach Luis Enrique said.",
      "He may have a point. Peculiarly, and despite the global nature of soccer, the club game has largely been restricted to continental competition, aside from the previous guise of the Club World Cup, which was often looked on as little more than a exhibition.",
      "Still, it remains unclear how much of an appetite there is for another soccer tournament in a calendar that has reached saturation point.",
      "So a crowd of more than 60,000 at the Hard Rock Stadium likely came as a relief to FIFA, though it is not known how many of those in attendance paid anything like the $349 being quoted for seats in December.",
      "FIFA has not offered definitive numbers on the amount of tickets sold for the tournament as a whole and prices were slashed as the opening game approached. But there were only pockets of empty seats in the stands, with many red-shirted fans of Al Ahly in attendance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking forward to it for a long time,\u201d said Peter Sadek a fan originally from Egypt and now living in Orlando. \u201cAt least 50 more just from our area (are coming). It's been bubbling up for a long time and you can see how many are here.\u201d",
      "Other Al Ahly fans had traveled directly from Egypt, with red shirts outnumbering the pink of Miami in parts of the stadium.",
      "If only Messi could have crowned Infantino's big night with a moment of magic.",
      "He certainly tried.",
      "His stunning curling effort from long range, deep into extra time would have been the perfect finish. Instead, Al Ahly goalkeeper Mohamed Elshenawy tipped the ball onto the crossbar to deny the Argentine great and Infantino that prize moment.",
      "Not even Infantino can have everything, it seems.",

      "A new poll finds Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his public falling-out with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

      "Meta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant.",
      "The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.",
      "Meta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.",
      "Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.",
      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",
      "It hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d",
      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just that now we have a clearer vision for how to accomplish this,\u201d he said.",
      "LeCun co-founded Meta's AI research division more than a decade ago with Rob Fergus, a fellow professor at New York University. Fergus later left for Google but returned to Meta last month after a 5-year absence to run the research lab, replacing longtime director Joelle Pineau.",
      "Fergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research \u201cremains unwavering\u201d and described the work as \u201cbuilding human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.\u201d",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "Davis said libraries also hold \u201csignificant amounts of interesting cultural, historical and language data\u201d that's missing from the past few decades of online commentary that AI chatbots have mostly learned from.",
      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",

      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",

      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",

      "PRAGUE -- Czech President Petr Pavel swore in a new justice minister on Tuesday, another step in a political crisis caused by a bitcoin-related scandal.",
      "Pavel appointed Eva Decroix after her predecessor Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from the post on May 30. He was under fire from the opposition because his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($46 million) earlier this year.",
      "Bla\u017eek said that he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",

      "\u201cThe public trust in the institutions and the state is at stake,\u201d Pavel said.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "The red fox is such a fixture of life in London that it has its own ambulance service",
      "PADDOCK WOOD, England -- The injured fox is cornered in a cage, teeth bared and snarling at the woman trying to help it.",
      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",

A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",

      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",
      "The company\u2019s success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic high priest.",
      "\u201cBitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy,\u201d Saylor said in a social media post.",
      "Saylor\u2019s success has also spawned many imitators.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking \u2026 that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone\u2019s pulling the trigger,\u201d said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.",
      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",
      "That\u2019s how much of a one-day percentage increase in stock prices firms have seen after recently announcing plans to hold other types of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasuries, highlighting how the appetite for such companies extends beyond bitcoin.",
      "SharpLink Gaming, a gambling marketing firm, saw its share price increase by more than 400% after it announced plans to buy up to $425 million in Ethereum, the second most popular form of cryptocurrency. And crypto firm Upexi saw its stock price soar more than 300% after it announced plans to buy $100 million of Solana, a cryptocurrency popular in the meme coin ecosystem.",

      "DETROIT -- A Chinese scientist was arrested while arriving in the U.S. at the Detroit airport, the second case in days involving the alleged smuggling of biological material, authorities said Monday.",
      "The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.",
      "\u201cThe guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,\u201d said John Nowak, who leads field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",

      "Her shipments, including an envelope stuffed inside a book, were intercepted last year and earlier this year and opened by authorities, the FBI said.",
      "The court filing doesn't indicate whether the FBI believes the biological material was risky, though U.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr. said smuggling \"threatens our security.\"",
      "The scientist remains in custody awaiting a bond hearing Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't strike me as something that is dangerous in any way. But there are rules to ship biological material,\u201d said Michael Shapira, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who read the court filing and spoke to The Associated Press.",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "Klobuchar: Minnesota lawmakers \"didn't deserve this to happen to them.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar mourned the two Minnesota state lawmakers shot early Saturday at their homes in what leaders are calling an \"act of targeted political violence,\" calling them \"friends\" and \"decent people\" who were simply \"trying to represent the people that they were elected to represent.\"",
      "The Minnesota Democrat told ABC News' \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that people should \"know\" the victims of political violence and threats -- in this case, state Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was killed alongside her husband, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who underwent surgery after the attack.",
      "\"She was a true leader, and I loved her work, but was always so grounded and such a decent person. I think that's probably the best word to describe her. You look at her pictures and you know what she was about. So we miss her greatly, and so when you hear about statistics about political violence and threats, I just want people to know who we're talking about,\" Klobuchar said about Hortman.",
      "\"Or Senator Hoffman. Equally respected. Got into politics because his daughter has spina bifida and she couldn't get insurance, and he wanted to advocate for her. Decent people who didn't deserve this to happen to them,\" Klobuchar continued.",
      "Authorities have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter as the suspected gunman and are continuing to search for him.",
      "Klobuchar described Hortman as an illustrious lawmaker and compassionate public servant, who began her career in public service as a mother with young children who had a background working at her father's auto parts company. Hortman easily juggled teaching Sunday school, leading a Girl Scout troop and training service dogs for veterans, Klobuchar said.",
      "The senator said she first got to know Hortman when she was a young lawmaker and she was struck with how she was able to know \"practically every person in her district.\"",
      "\"Melissa Hortman was a woman that I wish everyone around the country knew,\" Klobuchar told Raddatz. \"When you think about a true public servant who goes into it for the right reasons, it's Melissa.\"",
      "Klobuchar said that Hortman's ability to \"juggle it all\" may have contributed to the political success she'd been able to notch, especially in the past year with a divided legislature, when she worked alongside the state Senate's Republican leader to artfully negotiate a budget and avoid government shutdown.",
      "When she was the Speaker of the House, Hortman also spearheaded landmark legislation like paid family leave and free lunch for students, Klobuchar said.",
      "Klobuchar called the suspect \"evil,\" and \"smart\" on Sunday.",
      "\"He's evil. He is smart. He has killed without a second thought, and there's a $50,000 reward,\" she told Raddatz.",
      "The Minnesota Democrat lauded the cooperation between Minnesota leaders and state law enforcement.",
      "\"We couldn't be getting more help from law enforcement,\" Klobuchar said, applauding also local police officers' swift work on the ground, when they checked in on Hortman soon after getting called to Hoffman's house.",
      "\"Those local police officers at that moment not only appear to have saved [Hoffman] and his wife's life, but also had given us major leads to who he was and why he was doing this,\" Klobuchar said.",
      "Klouchar said she \"hasn't seen\" the target list written by the gunman, something that law enforcement sources say had dozens of Minnesota Democrats on it.",
      "Those on the list included Minnesota lawmakers Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith and state Attorney General Keith Ellison, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Klobuchar called political violence a \"rampant problem\" and said she \"believes\" that could have been one of the gunman's motivations for the Minnesota lawmaker shootings.",
      "\"I believe that there's some things in the manifesto that would lead you down that trail to believe that this was one of his motivating forces,\" Klobuchar said.",
      "She also highlighted the bipartisan statement against political violence that the Minnesota congressional delegation released after the shootings on Saturday.",
      "\"You speak with one voice to condemn this political violence. There's no place for this politically motivated violence in our democracy,\" Klobuchar said on Sunday. \"This is a rampant problem that the public and all of us have to deal with -- and also against judges, and all of us should condemn all of that violence,\" she said.",

      "Protests are set to take place in more than 2,000 communities around the U.S.",
      "Thousands of \"No Kings Day\" protests are set to be held throughout the country on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump's administration and to counterprogram the military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.",
      "Here's what to know about the protests.",
      "What is the idea behind \"No Kings Day\"?",
      "\"'No Kings Day' is the largest single-day, peaceful protest in recent American history, made up of millions of normal, everyday Americans who are showing up in more than 2,000 communities around the country to say, 'we don't do kings in America,'\" Ezra Levin, the co-executive director of progressive organizing group Indivisible, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Indivisible and other organizations involved with the coalition coordinating the protests have said that the protests are meant to protest what they say is overreach by the Trump administration on immigration enforcement and deportations, civil rights and cuts to the federal government.",
      "They've also pointed to how the military parade is being held on Trump's birthday. Trump has denied any connection between the parade's timing and his birthday, pointing to how June 14 is Flag Day.",
      "The groups coordinating the protests originally announced the initiatives in early May, after reports of the upcoming military parade, but organizers have said that the protests against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles and the response from the federal government have driven much more interest to the events.",
      "Where and when will the protests be?",
      "The protests will be held across the country and even beyond the United States, with a flagship event held in Philadelphia. Levin told ABC News there are now more than 2,000 events planned \"just about everywhere, everywhere but downtown D.C. -- intentionally so.\"",
      "According to Levin, the organizers did not want to give Trump a rationale to retaliate against peaceful protests in D.C. or to say that the protesters were protesting the military.",
      "\"We are ceding downtown D.C. Trump can have it for that day, and instead, we're organizing literally everywhere else,\" Levin said.",
      "Most of the protests around the country will be held in the morning, ahead of the parade. Some in the western part of the country may occur concurrently with the parade, which is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET.",
      "What has Trump said about the protests?",
      "Asked on Thursday about his thoughts on the \"No Kings\" protests planned across the country for Saturday, Trump said he did not feel like a king.",
      "\"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,\" he said.",
      "\"A king would say, 'I'm not gonna get this'... he wouldn't have to call up Mike Johnson and Thune and say, 'Fellas, you got to pull this off' and after years we get it done. No, no, we're not a king, we're not a king at all,\" he added, referencing the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate Majority leader, respectively.",
      "Trump, on Tuesday, had threatened to use \"heavy force\" against \"any\" protesters at the military parade in the nation's capital; White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that \"of course\" the president supports peaceful protestors. Organizers of the No Kings protests have continuously emphasized they are not planning protests in Washington.",
      "Are there safety concerns surrounding the protests?",
      "Organizers have emphasized that the protests should remain peaceful and nonviolent, pointing to various trainings they've held this week about safety and deescalation.",
      "Levin said there were some concerns about outside agitators trying to disrupt protests, but he said people shouldn't feel \"as if we're going into battle. That's not what this is about. This is peaceful protest. People are going to have funny signs, people are going to be dancing, people are going to be chanting, people are going to be expressing their First Amendment rights.\"",
      "At Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's recommendation, all \"No Kings\" events not already underway were canceled due to \"the individual who assassinated a Democratic lawmaker\" still being at large, according to the \"No Kings\" website.",
      "At least two states, Texas and Missouri, have said they are calling up the National Guard in their states as a precaution against the potential for any violence at protests on Saturday. The governors of both states affirmed that peaceful protests are legal.",
      "Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Ericka Miller told ABC News that the Capitol and Capitol grounds were evacuated at 1 p.m. local time due to a \"credible threat against state lawmakers planning to attend\" the No Kings protest. The event was supposed to begin at 5 p.m.",
      "\"We are working to address the threat,\" Miller said.",

    "summary": "Ahead of President Trump's military parade, a transgender service member who was barred from the military, reflects on \"patriotism\" and her fight against the ban.",
    "story": [
      "As the U.S. military prepares to celebrate the legacy of the Army with a massive parade in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, some transgender service members are grappling with an involuntary end to their careers after the Trump administration banned them from the military.",
      "\"I'm heartbroken,\" said Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a decorated Navy pilot who is also the lead plaintiff in Shilling vs. Trump -- one of three federal lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's executive order barring transgender service members.",
      "Shilling, who is based in the D.C. area, is also the president of Sparta Pride -- an organization advocating for 2,400 transgender people in the military and those who hope to join.",
      "Reflecting on the upcoming parade commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Army's founding, Shilling, who has served since 2005, told ABC News that \"military might does not equal patriotism.\"",
      "\"The members who take an oath and dedicate their lives to service -- that's patriotism, whether or not we have tanks or rocket launchers, that has nothing to do with it,\" Shilling said.",
      "And according to Shilling, for active duty members of Sparta, who were faced with the \"heartbreaking\" decision to voluntarily separate from the military or get kicked out, abandoning their commitment to serving their country is what's \"keeping them up at night.\"",
      "\"When I sit in these town halls that we do with Sparta, people are really struggling with the idea of giving up or quitting, or, you know, not fulfilling their oath,\" she said. \"And that's actually what's keeping these men, women and folks you know, up at night. They feel like they have a duty to keep serving and keep fighting.\"",
      "The Pentagon's new ban went into effect in early May shortly after the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could enforce the ban on transgender people in the military while legal challenges proceed in lower courts.",
      "After the Supreme Court ruling, the Pentagon issued a memo giving active duty service members until June 6 -- last Friday -- to self-identify and begin the voluntary separation process. Transgender service members in the reserve forces have until July 7 to voluntarily separate.",
      "The memo also stated that after June 6, military commanders will be told to identify people in their units who have a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria. The move would initiate a referral to an annual health check-up that would begin what could be a lengthy process for each individual that could lead to their removal from the military.",
      "Shilling, who will be eligible for retirement at 20 years in September, told ABC News that faced with these options, she chose to self-identify and begin the process of voluntarily separating from the military, but noted that she made the decision \"under duress.\"",
      "\"I hit my retirement date in September. So if I didn't volunteer at that time, I could theoretically be kicked out between June and September and lose everything,\" she said. \"So it was very much a decision made under duress. You know, I was coerced into it because we knew that the voluntary separation would give me an honorable discharge with some portion of my retirement, and I'd be able to keep all of my benefits.\"",
      "The Pentagon incentivized service members with gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate ahead of the June 6 deadline by offering benefit payment packages that would be more than double what would be received if they were to separate involuntarily. Those who voluntarily separated would not have to risk paying back the recruitment or retention bonuses they may have earned during their military service.",
      "Its policy came after the Trump administration announced a ban on transgender service members in a Jan. 27 executive order, where President Donald Trump directed the Defense Department to revise the policy allowing transgender troops to openly serve.",
      "\"Expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,\" the order said.",
      "The order further argued that receiving gender-affirming medical care is one of the conditions that is physically and mentally \"incompatible with active duty.\"",
      "Defense officials estimate that as of last December, about 4,240 current active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "There are more than 2.1 million military service members serving on active-duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Advocacy groups have put the actual number of transgender service members as being much higher, at around 15,000.",
      "\"There's a lot of fear,\" Shilling said, reflecting on service members like herself who are losing their jobs.",
      "She also said that being banned from the military has taken an emotional toll on the community -- some of whom have left \"rough homes\" and found a family in the military.",
      "\"For a lot of people, this was, you know, the dream they've always wanted, and now their family is saying, you're not good enough. They're being rejected again by another family,\" she said. \"And that's pretty brutal.\"",
      "When asked how she feels about her decision to voluntarily separate from the military, Shilling said that she is at \"peace\" because she knows that the fight is not over.",
      "\"I'm at peace,\" she said. \"I'm going to thrive, and I'm going to be able to fight this \u2026 and continue to fight for that America that I believe in -- that good, righteous America, and a lot of these service members feel very much the same.\"",

      "California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla has continued to defend himself and refute claims by the Trump administration that he \"crashed\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference before federal officers shoved him outside the room, pushed him to the floor and handcuffed him.",
      "Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, provided more details about the incident Thursday night during an interview on MSNBC -- in which he said he was not a threat and had merely raised his voice to ask a question.",
      "The senator claimed he did not barge into the news conference, as alleged by Noem, but rather he was in the federal building for an approved scheduled briefing with representatives of the Northern Command. He said that meeting was delayed by Noem's news conference in a nearby room, where she was discussing the administration's use of the National Guard to respond to protests over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "Padilla said he decided to go to listen to Noem's news conference and asked the National Guard member and FBI agent escorting with him if he could go.",
      "\"We're, the whole time, being escorted in this federal building by somebody from the National Guard, somebody from the FBI. I've gone through screening. This is a federal building. And so, I tell them, 'Let's go listen to the press conference.' They escort me over to that room,\" Padilla told MSNBC.",
      "\"The folks that were escorting me in the building walked me over. I didn't even open the door. The door was opened for me. And I spent a few minutes in the back of the room just listening in until the rhetoric, the political rhetoric got to be too much to take. So, I spoke up,\" he later added.",
      "During her news conference, Noem claimed she was going to \"liberate\" Los Angeles \"from the socialists and the burdensome leadership this governor and mayor have placed on this country and this city.\"",
      "Padilla told MSNBC that he felt he needed to speak out, said he introduced himself and started asking a question before the officers pushed him out of the room as news cameras, reporters and onlookers recorded the incident.",
      "Noem said law enforcement reacted as they did because Padilla came toward her without identifying himself. She told Fox News Thursday that no one knew who he was and that he was \"lunging forward.\"",
      "Video of the incident captures Padilla identifying himself and saying he wanted to ask a question as he is pushed out of the room; it's not clear from the video if he identified himself before that point, including as he came forward toward the podium. Padilla was wearing a navy blue polo shirt with a small U.S. Senate logo, but it was covered under a navy blue jacket. He said he was not wearing a U.S. Senate security pin at the time of the incident.",
      "After he was quickly released, he and Noem had a private conversation for \"10-15 minutes\" after the incident, according to both the senator and the secretary.",
      "Noem said that Padilla will likely not be charged.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said Padilla should be \"ashamed of his childish behavior.\"",
      "\"He crashed the middle of an official press conference being held by a cabinet secretary, recklessly lunged toward the podium where @Sec_Noem was speaking, and then refused to leave the room and follow the directions of law enforcement officers,\" Leavitt posted to X.",
      "Outraged Democratic senators quickly came to Padilla's defense Thursday, claiming Noem and the officers mistreated the senator.",
      "\"This is an administration that has no respect for our democracy, for our institutions, for the separation of powers, for a co-equal branch of government,\" California Sen. Adam Schiff said.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters, \"I've seen that one clip. It is horrible. It is shocking at every level. It's not the America I know.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans chastised Padilla, with Johnson going so far as saying censure might be needed. A vote to censure does not hold any power beyond a public condemnation of the member's behavior and it does not deny the member privileges.",
      "Sen. Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday evening that he had spoken with Padilla and the Senate Sergeant At Arms and had attempted to reach Noem in an effort to gather the facts.",
      "\"We want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator, that is, try to gather all of the relevant information,\" he said.",
      "When asked if he thought what occurred was appropriate based on what he had so far seen, Thune said, \"That's all I've got to say.\"",

      "Two weeks after crossing the stage to receive his high school diploma, 18-year-old Brandon Moss stepped foot on another podium -- this time announcing his run for mayor of Fairfield, Alabama, he told ABC News.",
      "Fresh out of high school and beginning preparations for college this fall, Moss is the youngest mayoral candidate in the history of Fairfield, a city of about 9,500 people that is southwest of Birmingham, according to his campaign manager, Marilyn Yelder.",
      "\"I am ready to take on this challenge. Age doesn't guarantee wisdom or innovation,\" Moss told ABC News. \"I'm not going to say I'm perfect or I know it all, it will take a team of good people to be able to accomplish good things.\"",
      "When he launched his campaign on June 7, the Fairfield native told reporters that he is running for mayor because \"I love this city, and I believe in its future.\"",
      "Moss, who has always been interested in the \"inner workings of politics,\" told ABC News he decided to run for mayor after noticing a \"bigger need\" in the city of Fairfield, specifically regarding \"businesses and a better way of living.\"",
      "Citing Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin (who has been in office since 2017) and former President Barack Obama as his political role models, Moss said he plans on bringing a \"new vision and fresh perspective\" to the mayoral office if elected.",
      "\"The past administrations and the people that are running have done a great job in Fairfield, but I think it's time that we look for something new,\" Moss said.",
      "His political portfolio includes experience working in the Alabama Youth and Government program -- as a youth senator and in the governor's cabinet -- along with serving on the Student Advisory Board for the superintendent of Birmingham City Schools. He also worked as an executive intern for the superintendent's office and is a graduate of the Alabama Academy of Civic Engagement.",
      "If elected mayor, Moss said he will focus on the city's finances by bringing in a forensic auditor to monitor the city's spending and will also highlight small businesses by creating pop-up stores in a shopping mall so that they can have \"a chance to be seen,\" Moss said.",
      "He also plans on tackling blight, an issue where run-down or vacant homes become overgrown with vegetation. Moss said if elected, he will work with the federal government to receive grants that can help remove these homes from the community.",
      "Moss, who is attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham this fall, is prepared to juggle college classes and mayoral responsibilities, Yelder -- his campaign manager -- told ABC News.",
      "\"He does have a team of mentors for every aspect, not just to help him get to mayor, but people that are helping with public speaking, mental health,\" Yelder said. \"I think he will be more than prepared, even at 18, to take on the role as mayor of Fairfield.\"",
      "Other candidates vying for the office include Councilman Herman Carnes, Councilman Cedric Norman, former Midfield Councilman and Fairfield native James Reasor and financial consultant Michael Williams, according to ABC Birmingham affiliate WBMA.",
      "If Moss isn't not elected on Aug. 26, Moss said he will plan on working in a political office. If the votes are in his favor, he said he will \"do the job and see where it takes me.\"",

      "A growing number of Spaniards are souring on the country's highly successful tourism industry which is being blamed for a stubborn housing crisis",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- In Barcelona's residential Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood known for its quaint squares, Txema Escorsa feels he is being left behind.",
      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",
      "Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate AP interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "\u201cThese record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges, and we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population,\u201d Cuerpo said.",
      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",
      "He says hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists. In Barcelona, hotels accounted for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data.",

      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Escorsa, the teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

So we were delayed in getting there because there was just so much damage.\"",
      "Vargo added: \u201cIt happened so quickly and so fast. \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing this for 35 years. I\u2019ve seen major floods here in the city and the county. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d",
      "Authorities said vehicles were swept into in swollen creeks, some people sought safety in trees and a mobile home caught fire.",

He said first responders regrouped Sunday morning and were focused on an area from the Ohio state line across the Ohio River to Wheeling Creek.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re searching the banks, we\u2019re searching submerged vehicles, any debris we find along the trail and so forth,\u201d Blazier said. \u201cWe\u2019re using drones, search dogs and swift water personnel, and we have teams organized that are searching sectors that we\u2019re trying to recover anybody that\u2019s missing.\u201d",
      "There were about 4,000 power outages in the county. Restoration efforts were hampered by natural gas leaks that have to be fixed first, officials said.",
      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in Ohio County. He said state police and other state officials were responding, and he directed the National Guard to provide any needed assistance.",
      "\u201cPlease keep this community in your prayers,\u201d Morrisey said in a statement Sunday. \u201cMore storms are expected in the region today. Please follow all directives from local and state emergency management officials and do not attempt to drive through flooded roads.\u201d",
      "The West Virginia rains followed heavy downpours in San Antonio on Thursday that killed 13 people. More than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain fell over a span of hours in the Texas city, causing fast-rising floodwaters to carry more than a dozen cars into a creek.",

      "A massive search is stretching into its second day for a man who authorities say posed as a police officer and fatally shot a Democratic state lawmaker in her suburban Minneapolis home",
      "BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. -- A massive search was stretching into its second day for a man who authorities say posed as a police officer and fatally shot a Democratic state lawmaker in her suburban Minneapolis home, an act Gov. Tim Walz called \u201ca politically motivated assassination.\u201d Authorities said the suspect also shot and wounded a second lawmaker and was trying to flee the area.",
      "Former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday. Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin address, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away.",
      "Authorities identified the suspect as 57-year-old Vance Boelter, and the FBI issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. They shared a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings. Hundreds of law enforcement officers fanned out in the search for the suspect.",
      "Authorities had not given any details on a possible motive as of Saturday night.",
      "Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other.",
      "The attacks prompted warnings to other state elected officials and the cancellation of planned \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations against President Donald Trump, though some went ahead anyway. Authorities said the suspect had \u201cNo Kings\u201d flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets.",
      "A Minnesota official told AP the suspect\u2019s writings also contained information targeting prominent lawmakers who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.",
      "Law enforcement agents recovered several AK-style firearms from the suspect\u2019s vehicle, and he was believed to still be armed with a pistol, a person familiar with the matter told AP. The person could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The shootings happened at a time when political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions.",
      "\u201cWe must all, in Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence,\u201d said Walz, a Democrat. He also ordered flags to fly at half-staff in Hortman's honor.",
      "\u201cSuch horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\u201d President Donald Trump said in a statement.",
      "Police responded to reports of gunfire at the Hoffmans' home shortly after 2 a.m., Champlin police said, and found the couple with multiple gunshot wounds.",
      "After seeing who the victims were, police sent officers to proactively check on Hortman's home. There they encountered what appeared to be a police vehicle and a man dressed as an officer at the door, leaving the house.",
      "\u201cWhen officers confronted him, the individual immediately fired upon the officers who exchanged gunfire, and the suspect retreated back into the home\u201d and escaped on foot, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said.",
      "Multiple bullet holes could be seen in the front door of Hoffman\u2019s home.",
      "John and Yvette Hoffman each underwent surgery, according to Walz.",
      "Hortman, 55, had been the top Democratic leader in the state House since 2017. She led Democrats in a three-week walkout at the beginning of this year\u2019s session in a power struggle with Republicans. Under a power sharing agreement, she turned the gavel over to Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth and assumed the title speaker emerita.",
      "Hortman used her position as speaker in 2023 to champion expanded protections for abortion rights, including legislation to solidify Minnesota\u2019s status as a refuge for patients from restrictive states who travel to the state to seek abortions \u2014 and to protect providers who serve them.",
      "Walz called her a \u201cformidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.\"",
      "Hortman and her husband had two adult children.",
      "The initial autopsy reports from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office gave their cause of death as \u201cmultiple gunshot wounds.\u201d",
      "The reports said Melissa Hortman died at the scene while her husband was pronounced dead at the hospital.",
      "Hoffman, 60, was first elected in 2012 and was chair of the Senate Human Services Committee, which oversees one of the biggest parts of the state budget. He and his wife have one daughter.",
      "Boelter was appointed to the workforce development board in 2016 and then reappointed in 2019 to a four-year term that expired in 2023, state records show.",
      "Corporate records show Boelter\u2019s wife filed to create a company called Praetorian Guard Security Services LLC with the same Green Isle mailing address listed for the couple. Boelter\u2019s wife is listed as president and CEO and he is listed as director of security patrols on the company's website.",
      "The website says the company provides armed security for property and events and features a photo of an SUV painted in a two-tone black and silver pattern similar to a police vehicle. Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest.",
      "An online resume says Boelter is a security contractor who has worked in the Middle East and Africa, in addition to past managerial roles at companies in Minnesota.",
      "Around 6 a.m., Boelter texted friends to say he had \u201cmade some choices,\u201d the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.",
      "In the messages, read to reporters by David Carlson, Boelter did not specify what he had done but said: \u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way. \u2026 I\u2019m sorry for all the trouble this has caused.\u201d",
      "Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican from Cold Spring, called the attack \u201cevil\u201d and said she was \u201cheartbroken beyond words\u201d by the killings.",
      "The shootings are the latest in a series of attacks against lawmakers across parties.",
      "In April a suspect set fire to the home of Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, forcing him and his family to flee during the Jewish holiday of Passover. The suspect said he planned to beat Shapiro with a small sledgehammer if he found him, according to court documents.",
      "In July 2024, Trump was grazed on the ear by one of a hail of bullets that killed a Trump supporter. Two months later a man with a rifle was discovered near the president's Florida golf course and arrested.",
      "Other incidents include a 2022 hammer attack on the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in their San Francisco home and a 2020 plot by anti-government extremists to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and start a civil war.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he asked Capitol Police to \u201cimmediately increase security\u201d for Minnesota Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. He also asked Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, to hold a briefing on member security.",

      "A South Florida zoo\u2019s oldest resident is celebrating his 135th birthday and his first Father\u2019s Day",
      "MIAMI -- A South Florida zoo's oldest resident celebrated his 135th birthday and his first Father's Day on Sunday.",
      "Goliath, a 517-pound (234-kilogram) Galapagos tortoise at Zoo Miami, became a father for the first time earlier this month, zoo officials said.",
      "\u201cGoliath is my hero, and I am sure he will soon be an inspiration to many others!\u201d Zoo Miami spokesman Ron Magill said in a statement. \u201cHe is living proof that where there is a will, there is a way and to never give up!\u201d",
      "One egg out of a clutch of eight laid on Jan. 27 successfully hatched on June 4, officials said. Besides being Goliath's first offspring, it's also the first time one of the endangered reptiles has hatched at Zoo Miami. The animals' numbers were drastically reduced before the 20th century by human exploitation and the introduction of invasive species to the Galapagos Islands. Modern threats include climate change and habitat loss.",
      "According to Goliath\u2019s official record, he hatched on the island of Santa Cruz in the Galapagos on June 15, between 1885 and 1890. The island group is located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, several hundred miles west of mainland Ecuador.",
      "Goliath arrived at the Bronx Zoo in 1929 and moved to Zoo Miami in 1981. He has bred with several different females during his time at Zoo Miami, but he has never sired an offspring. The new hatchling's mother, Sweet Pea, is estimated to be between 85 and 100 years old.",
      "Both parents are doing well in their public habitat, officials said. The hatchling appears to be healthy in a separate enclosure. Wild hatchlings are not raised by their parents.",

    "story": [
      "The prospect of a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients is sparking fears",
      "It took Crystal Strickland years to qualify for Medicaid, which she needs for a heart condition.",
      "Strickland, who's unable to work due to her condition, chafed when she learned that the U.S. House has passed a bill that would impose a work requirement for many able-bodied people to get health insurance coverage through the low-cost, government-run plan for lower-income people.",
      "\u201cWhat sense does that make?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat about the people who can\u2019t work but can\u2019t afford a doctor?\u201d",
      "The measure is part of the version of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful\u201d bill that cleared the House last month and is now up for consideration in the Senate. Trump is seeking to have it passed by July 4.",
      "The bill as it stands would cut taxes and government spending \u2014 and also upend portions of the nation\u2019s social safety net.",
      "For proponents, the ideas behind the work requirement are simple: Crack down on fraud and stand on the principle that taxpayer-provided health coverage isn't for those who can work but aren\u2019t. The measure includes exceptions for those who are under 19 or over 64, those with disabilities, pregnant women, main caregivers for young children, people recently released from prisons or jails \u2014 or during certain emergencies. It would apply only to adults who receive Medicaid through expansions that 40 states chose to undertake as part of the 2010 health insurance overhaul.",
      "Many details of how the changes would work would be developed later, leaving several unknowns and causing anxiety among recipients who worry that their illnesses might not be enough to exempt them.",
      "Advocates and sick and disabled enrollees worry \u2014 based largely on their past experience \u2014 that even those who might be exempted from work requirements under the law could still lose benefits because of increased or hard-to-meet paperwork mandates.",
      "Strickland, a 44-year-old former server, cook and construction worker who lives in Fairmont, North Carolina, said she could not afford to go to a doctor for years because she wasn't able to work. She finally received a letter this month saying she would receive Medicaid coverage, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's already kind of tough to get on Medicaid,\u201d said Strickland, who has lived in a tent and times and subsisted on nonperishable food thrown out by stores. \u201cIf they make it harder to get on, they're not going to be helping.\u201d",
      "Steve Furman is concerned that his 43-year-old son, who has autism, could lose coverage.",
      "The bill the House adopted would require Medicaid enrollees to show that they work, volunteer or go to school at least 80 hours a month to continue to qualify.",
      "A disability exception would likely apply to Furman's son, who previously worked in an eyeglasses plant in Illinois for 15 years despite behavioral issues that may have gotten him fired elsewhere.",
      "Furman said government bureaucracies are already impossible for his son to navigate, even with help.",
      "It took him a year to help get his son onto Arizona's Medicaid system when they moved to Scottsdale in 2022, and it took time to set up food benefits. But he and his wife, who are retired, say they don't have the means to support his son fully.",
      "\u201cShould I expect the government to take care of him?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I do expect them to have humanity.\u201d",
      "About 71 million adults are enrolled in Medicaid now. And most of them \u2014 around 92% \u2014 are working, caregiving, attending school or disabled. Earlier estimates of the budget bill from the Congressional Budget Office found that about 5 million people stand to lose coverage.",
      "A KFF tracking poll conducted in May found that the enrollees come from across the political spectrum. About one-fourth are Republicans; roughly one-third are Democrats.",
      "The poll found that about 7 in 10 adults are worried that federal spending reductions on Medicaid will lead to more uninsured people and would strain health care providers in their area. About half said they were worried reductions would hurt the ability of them or their family to get and pay for health care.",
      "Amaya Diana, an analyst at KFF, points to work requirements launched in Arkansas and Georgia as keeping people off Medicaid without increasing employment.",
      "Amber Bellazaire, a policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, said the process to verify that Medicaid enrollees meet the work requirements could be a key reason people would be denied or lose eligibility.",
      "\u201cMassive coverage losses just due to an administrative burden rather than ineligibility is a significant concern,\u201d she said.",
      "One KFF poll respondent, Virginia Bell, a retiree in Starkville, Mississippi, said she's seen sick family members struggle to get onto Medicaid, including one who died recently without coverage.",
      "She said she doesn't mind a work requirement for those who are able \u2014 but worries about how that would be sorted out. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to determine who needs it and who doesn't need it,\u201d she said.",
      "Lexy Mealing, 54 of Westbury, New York, who was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021 and underwent a double mastectomy and reconstruction surgeries, said she fears she may lose the medical benefits she has come to rely on, though people with \u201cserious or complex\u201d medical conditions could be granted exceptions.",
      "She now works about 15 hours a week in \u201cgig\u201d jobs but isn't sure she can work more as she deals with the physical and mental toll of the cancer.",
      "Mealing, who used to work as a medical receptionist in a pediatric neurosurgeon\u2019s office before her diagnosis and now volunteers for the American Cancer Society, went on Medicaid after going on short-term disability.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine going through treatments right now and surgeries and the uncertainty of just not being able to work and not have health insurance,\u201d she said.",
      "Felix White, who has Type I diabetes, first qualified for Medicaid after losing his job as a computer programmer several years ago.",
      "The Oreland, Pennsylvania, man has been looking for a job, but finds that at 61, it's hard to land one.",
      "Medicaid, meanwhile, pays for a continuous glucose monitor and insulin and funded foot surgeries last year, including one that kept him in the hospital for 12 days.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have afforded that,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have lost my foot and probably died.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- There were funnel cakes, stands of festival bling and American flags aplenty. There were mighty machines of war, brought out to dazzle and impress. And there was the spray of tear gas against demonstrators in Los Angeles and Atlanta, and rolling waves of anti-Trump resistance coast to coast.",
      "In scenes of celebration, protest and trepidation Saturday, masses of Americans cheered for a rousing Army parade like none seen in Washington in generations. Masses more rallied across the country against a president derided by his critics as an authoritarian, would-be king.",
      "On Saturday, the U.S. Army turned 250 and President Donald Trump 79. The double birthday bash energized crowds of well-wishers and military families in the capital while others decried the militarization of city streets \u2014 in Los Angeles, where a federalized National Guard and U.S. Marines remained deployed against unrest, and in Washington for the parade.",
      "In these times, the fault lines of American life were evident.",
      "\u201cOne nation under distress,\u201d read a sign carried in a crowd of 1,000 protesters on the grounds of Florida\u2019s old Capitol in Tallahassee. Forewarned of a heavy state response if the crowd caused any trouble, organizers implored the peaceful protesters to not so much as jaywalk.",
      "Yet, in his Trump 2024 shirt, retired American Airlines pilot Larry Stallard happily lived out \u201cone thing on my bucket list\u201d from his perch on the parade route. Stallard, 82, came from Kansas City for the event. He declared Trump \u201cone of the best presidents in my lifetime\u201d and concluded, \u201cIt's been a long day, but it's worth it.\u201d",
      "Trump's remarks, about eight minutes, were brief for him as he capped the showy parade he had longed for in his first term and, early in his second, finally got.",
      "\u201cThere is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of the U.S. military or an Army Ranger paratrooper or Green Beret,\u201d he told the crowd. From Bunker Hill to the mountains of Afghanistan, the president said, \u201cthe Army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage, untold sacrifice.\u201d",
      "Spirited \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests unfolded in cities and towns across the American republic. But in Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz asked people to stay away from anti-Trump demonstrations after the assassination of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, by a gunman still on the loose.",
      "In Los Angeles, epicenter of days-long protests sparked by Trump's crackdown on immigrants, police on horseback charged a previously calm crowd, firing tear gas and crowd control projectiles. \"We weren\u2019t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,\u201d said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender.",
      "Law enforcement officers in Atlanta deployed tear gas to divert several hundred nonviolent protesters heading toward Interstate 285 in the northern part of the city. In Culpeper, Virginia, one person was struck by an SUV that police say was intentionally accelerated into the crowd as protesters were leaving an event.",
      "In Washington, more than 6,000 soldiers marched in period-by-period uniforms, dating back to the garb of the ragtag Continental Army and the rise of a nation that would become the world\u2019s most potent military power. In the mix: tanks, parachute jumps and flyovers by more than 60 aircraft.",
      "With evening thunderstorms in the forecast, the parade started well ahead of schedule. In the first 40 minutes, it sped through more than 200 years of Army history, from 1775 to 1991.",
      "Vietnam-era helicopters, including the Huey, roared overhead, as did World War II-vintage aircraft. Sherman tanks, used extensively in that war's European theater, rumbled in the procession along with modern machinery. The Army's Golden Knights parachute team jumped early, releasing streaks of red smoke across the sky and making the crowd scream with excitement as they floated to the ground.",
      "At the festival earlier, attendees sported apparel celebrating both the Army and Trump. Vendors moved through the crowd, selling Trump-themed merchandise, while others offered gear commemorating the Army\u2019s milestone.",
      "It was all too much for Wind Euler, 62, who flew from Arizona to join the protesters. \u201cMy father was a Marine in Iwo Jima, and he was a Republican,\" Euler said. \"I think he would be appalled by the fascist display this parade shows.\u201d",
      "In a camouflage jacket and Army baseball hat, Army veteran Aaron Bogner of Culpeper, Virginia, decried how he believes Trump is using the U.S. military to advance a personal agenda. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful,\" Bogner said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an engineered birthday party. It\u2019s an excuse to have tanks in your streets like North Korea.\u201d",
      "Above all, Bogner said, he came to protest the deployment of U.S. troops in Los Angeles after lawlessness broke out in pockets of the city along with peaceful demonstrations. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand when it became unpatriotic to protest,\u201d he said.",
      "In Atlanta, police yelled \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and \u201cyou must disperse\u201d into megaphones as they used tear gas to divert protesters off the road. The tear gas caused the crowd to disperse away from the interstate. Two police helicopters flew above as the crowd moved.",
      "Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, used bicycles to corral marchers. After the main \u201cNo Kings\u201d march ended in Charlotte, a second, unpermitted march began, producing a police confrontation.",
      "Officers formed a barricade with bicycles and yelled \u201cmove back\u201d as protesters attempted to march through uptown Charlotte. In response, demonstrators chanted \u201clet us walk\u201d as police continued to shift them back. Protesters also shouted \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d and \u201cno more Nazis.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has long bet that he can scare allies into submission",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump has long bet that he can scare allies into submission \u2014 a gamble that is increasingly being tested ahead of the Group of Seven summit beginning Monday in Canada.",
      "He's threatened stiff tariffs in the belief that other nations would crumple. He's mused about taking over Canada and Greenland. He's suggested he will not honor NATO's obligations to defend partners under attack. And he's used Oval Office meetings to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "But many world leaders see fewer reasons to be cowed by Trump, even as they recognize the risks if he followed through on his threats. They believe he will ultimately back down \u2014 since many of his plans could inflict harm on the U.S. \u2014 or that he can simply be charmed and flattered into cooperating.",
      "\u201cMany leaders still seem intimidated by Trump, but increasingly they are catching on to his pattern of bullying,\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn places as diverse as Canada, Iran, China and the EU, we are seeing increasing signs that leaders now recognize that Trump is afraid of anything resembling a fair fight. And so they are increasingly willing to stand up to him.\u201d",
      "In the 22 instances in which Trump has publicly threatened military action since his first term, the U.S. only used force twice, according to a May analysis by Shapiro.",
      "Ahead of the G7 summit, there are already signs of subtle pushback against Trump from fellow leaders in the group. French President Emanuel Macron planned to visit Greenland over the weekend in a show of European solidarity. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said the U.S. is no longer the \u201cpredominant\u201d force in the world after Trump's tariffs created fissures in a decades-long partnership between the U.S. and its northern neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage,\" Carney said this past week in French. \"Today, that predominance is a thing of the past.\u201d",
      "The new prime minister added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the U.S. became the global hegemon, a position of authority undermined by Trump's transactional nature that puts little emphasis on defending democratic values or the rule of law.",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Israel\u2019s attack on Iran has added a new wrinkle to the global picture as the summit leaders gather to tackle some of the world\u2019s thorniest problems",
      "A senior Canadian official said it was decided early on that the G7 won\u2019t be issuing a joint communiqu\u00e9 as it has at past summits \u2014 an indication of how hard it can be to get Trump on the same page with other world leaders. The White House said individual leader statements will be issued on the issues being discussed.",
      "Speaking last month at a conference in Singapore, Macron called France a \u201cfriend and an ally of the United States\u201d but pushed back against Trump's desire to dominate what other countries do. Macron said efforts to force other nations to choose between the U.S. and China would lead to the breakdown of the global order put in place after World War II.",
      "\u201cWe want to cooperate, but we do not want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed, and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,\u201d Macron said.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pushed back against Trump's agenda of levying higher tariffs on imported goods, arguing it would hurt economic growth. The Japanese leader specifically called Trump ahead of the summit to confirm their plans to talk on the sidelines, which is a greater focus for Japan than the summit itself.",
      "\u201cI called him as I also wanted to congratulate his birthday, though one day earlier,\u201d Ishiba said.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the summit was an opportunity for Trump to \u201cmend\u201d relationships with other countries so China would be unable to exploit differences among the G7.",
      "She said other foreign leaders are \u201cnot intimidated\u201d by Trump's actions, which could be driving them away from tighter commitments with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe conversations that I\u2019ve had with those leaders suggest that they think that the partnership with the United States has been really important, but they also understand that there are other opportunities,\u201d Shaheen said.",
      "The White House did not respond to emailed questions for this story.",
      "Having originally made his reputation in real estate and hospitality, Trump has taken kindly to certain foreign visitors, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Starmer has sought to keep Trump in line with Europe in supporting Ukraine and NATO instead of brokering any truces that would favor Russia. He has echoed the president\u2019s language about NATO members spending more on defense. But in his Oval Office visit, Starmer also pleased Trump by delivering an invite for a state visit from King Charles III.",
      "The German government said it, too, wanted to send a public signal of unity, saying that while Trump's recent meeting with Merz at the White House went harmoniously, the next test is how the relationship plays out in a team setting.",
      "There will also be other world leaders outside of the G7 nations attending the summit in mountainous Kananaskis, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump dressed down in the Oval Office.",
      "Italy's Meloni has positioned herself as a \u201cbridge\u201d between the Trump administration and the rest of Europe. But Italy\u2019s strong support of Ukraine and Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on European goods have put Meloni, the only European leader to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration, in a difficult position.",
      "Mark Sobel, U.S. chair of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, an independent think tank, said Trump's \u201ctrade policies, backing for right wing European movements, seeming preference for dealing with authoritarians and many of his other actions are alienating our G7 allies,\u201d even if the U.S. president is correct that Europe needs to do more on defense.",
      "But even as other G7 leaders defuse any public disputes with Trump, the U.S. president's vision for the world remains largely incompatible with they want.",
      "\u201cIn short, behind the curtains, and notwithstanding whatever theater, the Kananaskis summit will highlight a more fragmented G7 and an adrift global economy,\" Sobel said.",

      "Democrats in Virginia are holding primary elections Tuesday, and one name is getting talked about a lot: President Donald Trump",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014",
      "Two Virginia Democrats are battling Tuesday to be their party's nominee for attorney general. Yet, the name mentioned most in their campaigns is not that of their opponent, but rather a man who lives just over the Arlington Memorial Bridge: President Donald Trump.",
      "The barrage of changes Trump has wrought to American culture in the first few months of his second White House residency has ignited the campaigns of Virginia Democrats Jay Jones and Shannon Taylor as they appeal unrelentingly to the most devout swaths of their base ahead of down-ballot primary elections. The primary will also determine the party\u2019s nominations this year for lieutenant governor and some contested seats in the House of Delegates.",
      "In one of only two states electing governors in November \u2014 the other is New Jersey \u2014 the caustic anti-Trump rhetoric could be a hint of what voters nationwide will hear from Democrats in next year's midterm elections, when the stakes will be higher.",
      "Virginia's nominees for governor have been settled by default. Democrat Abigail Spanberger became her party's nominee after running unopposed, and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears was the only contender who gathered enough signatures to be on the ballot. The other statewide races are for attorney general and lieutenant governor, and Democrats in both contests seem to be vying to top each other with anti-Trump rhetoric and caustic ads.",
      "Republicans are not hosting statewide primaries this year, so only Democrats will pick a nominee for lieutenant governor. It's a part-time position that pays about $36,000 a year but is often a stepping stone to higher office. Six Democrats want the job, and most of them have pushed ad after ad on the airwaves and online about their commitment to taking on Trump if elected to the mostly ceremonial role.",
      "In the contest for attorney general, Jones and Taylor are competing in much the same way. Turnout is likely to be sluggish, which means firing up base voters is widely seen as the way to go. The last time a left-wing candidate for governor ran unopposed, roughly 142,000 Democrats voted for an attorney general nominee compared with more than 485,000 this past election cycle.",
      "Still, the AG's race has been spicy, more so when the candidates' criticism isn't directed at each other. Jones and Taylor have lambasted the White House and argued that the administration\u2019s actions should be litigated in court. When they are not lamenting Trump, their attacks are directed toward incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection.",
      "In their respective campaigns, the Democrats argue that Miyares submits to the president by not suing him. They say that sets him apart from more progressive attorneys general across the United States, who are going to court over such things as birthright citizenship and elections. Their main message: A Democrat will take the White House to trial when Miyares won\u2019t \u2014 and saving democracy starts there.",
      "\u201cThe job is to protect Virginians, to fight for them, to work for them, to keep us safe,\u201d Jones said while campaigning in June in Falls Church, Virginia, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he is not going after them.\u201d",
      "Last month, Taylor told a room full of Democratic voters that Miyares would enable Trump\u2019s overreaches in Virginia, and potentially double down on institutions that don\u2019t comply with the president.",
      "Either way, \u201cthe result is the same for Virginians: getting hurt,\u201d she said.",
      "In a wide-ranging interview in May, Miyares said he identifies as a balls-and-strikes Republican. The former Virginia Beach state delegate, elected top prosecutor in 2021, worked to reduce violent crime. He sought settlements from Big Pharma. When he felt President Joe Biden\u2019s administration overstepped, he went to court.",
      "But as Trump was ushered into office for a second term, Miyares entered new political terrain. Unlike most other states, Virginians will elect their attorney general this November, nearly a year after the country voted for the president and his consequential agenda.",
      "Miyares has waded into the political arena. He often spars on social media with progressive prosecutors throughout Virginia for being too lenient in prosecuting criminal cases.",
      "Still, Miyares rebuffed the notion that suing Trump is his top concern. He said the Democrats looking to replace him fail to understand the nature of his position.",
      "The attorney general touted meaningful work his office has shouldered: holding listening sessions for crime victims, designating resources to support law enforcement and beefing up his office\u2019s prosecutions of child support cases.",
      "He flashed his law enforcement badge, tucked within a leather wallet, and described the emblem as a guidepost for being an effective people\u2019s prosecutor.",
      "\u201cThey seem very obsessed with Donald Trump, whereas I\u2019m obsessed with how am I going to keep Virginians safe?\u201d Miyares said.",

      "Today's United States \u2014 its possibility, its strength, its divisiveness, its polarization and fragmentation \u2014 is encapsulated in a single week in June 2025, its triumphs and frictions on vivid display.",
      "As events both planned and chaotically spontaneous play out, many Americans are frantically and sometimes furiously pondering assorted iterations of two questions: What is this country right now? And what should it be?",
      "Consider two quotes from recent days from two very different Americans.",
      "The first came last weekend, during World Pride in Washington, when a 58-year-old gay man from Philadelphia named David Begler summed up what many were messaging in the days leading up to it after months of Donald Trump's increasing attempts to target the LGBTQ community: \"I want us to send a message to the White House to focus on uplifting each other instead of dividing.\u201c",
      "The second came days ahead of the military parade planned Saturday for the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, from the mouth of the president on whose 79th birthday it will be held: \u201cIf there\u2019s any protester that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,\u201d Donald Trump said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.\u201d",
      "Among the competing visions of America in 2025: the desire to protest and seek a redress of grievances against the government vs. the desire for control, order \u2014 and a respect for the government and for authority.",
      "The volatile combination of demonstrations and the U.S. military is a potent one, with its most recent roots in the protest movement of the 1960s against the Vietnam War. A young generation that would later be known as baby boomers regularly squared off against police and sometimes the military over U.S. involvement in what was framed as a war against communism in Southeast Asia. Historians give those protesters a fair bit of the credit for that war ultimately ending in 1975. President Jimmy Carter ultimately pardoned more than 200,000 people who had dodged the draft for that conflict.",
      "Then, as now, many in the establishment criticized protesters bitterly, saying they were undermining a nation to which they should be grateful. Questions of loyalty and betrayal were thrown around. The role of the military in quelling civilian protests was bitterly contested, particularly after Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire and killed four students during antiwar protests in May 1970 at Kent State University.",
      "There are echoes of that this week, not only in Los Angeles but now in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the deployment of 5,000 state National Guard troops ahead of the \u201cNo Kings Day of Defiance\u201d against the Trump administration's ongoing immigration raids. And as protesters in Los Angeles taunt the military and say guardsmen should be \u201cashamed\u201d to face off against what they call a just cause, it's easy to wonder: How can patriotism and protest coexist?",
      "Democracy has always been messy and resistant to consensus. That's part of why the national slogan of the United States is \u201ce pluribus unum\u201d \u2014 \u201cout of many, one.\u201d And Washington, D.C., as the nation's capital, has long been the place where the many have come to make themselves known as part of the one \u2014 and to be noticed.",
      "It was where the \u201cBonus Army\" of World War I veterans marched in 1932 to demand their promised postwar payments and be heard in a demonstration that ended violently. It was where the first National Boy Scout Jamboree was held on the National Mall in 1937. It was where the \u201cMarch on Washington,\u201d a centerpiece of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, ended with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s renowned \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. It was where, in 1995, the \u201cMillion Man March\u201d was held to address concerns of the American Black community, and where hundreds of thousands of women came to Washington largely in protest of Trump, just a day after his first inauguration.",
      "It is also the place where Americans remember, where the memorials to World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War sit. It is where the country erected stone shrines in various shapes and sizes to the presidents it most admired \u2014 Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is the site of museums containing some of the most distilled expressions of culture \u2014 from the Holocaust Museum to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to the National Museum of African American History.",
      "Is it so hard to believe, then, that two events as opposite as World Pride and a military parade unfold here, within blocks of each other, within a week's time? At a politically fractious moment when some families can hardly break bread without political arguments erupting over Trump, Gaza and Israel, immigration and LGBTQ rights, isn't it possible that the weird and downright uncomfortable juxtaposition of these two starkly different events might be the most American thing of all?",
      "Walt Whitman, one of the most famous poets in American history, had this to say about the the diversity of America when he wrote \u201cI Hear America Singing\u201d to underscore that its citizens all contribute to the nation's song: \u201cI am large. I contain multitudes.\u201d",
      "And in one week in June, at a time when the fate of the United States is being discussed in every direction we turn, the capital of Whitman's nation has become a showcase in displaying those messy democratic multitudes to the world. For better or for worse.",

      "The fifth week of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial featured a courthouse appearance by one of his famous friends: Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West",
      "NEW YORK -- The fifth week of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2019 sex trafficking trial featured four days of testimony from a former Combs' girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym Jane and a surprise appearance at the courthouse on the fifth day by Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.",
      "Ye said he came to show his support for his good friend but couldn't get into the courtroom and watched for a few minutes on an overflow courtroom monitor.",
      "Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, has pleaded not guilty in the trial, which resumes Monday.",
      "Here are key moments from the past week:",
      "Jane testified for six days about her over three-year relationship with Combs, saying her plans to meet him at a New York hotel last September were interrupted by his arrest.",
      "Her testimony consumed four of the week's five trial days as she told about her conflicted feelings toward Combs.",
      "She told a prosecutor: \u201cI just pray for his continued healing, and I pray for peace for him.\u201d And when a defense lawyer asked if she still loved him, she responded: \u201cI do.\u201d",
      "When she completed her testimony and with the jury still in the room, she went to the prosecutor and gave her a warm embrace before proceeding to the defense attorney and hugging her too.",
      "She said she resents she felt forced to have sex with strangers in multiday sex marathons as the man she longed most to cuddle with filmed and fed her drugs to give her energy to satisfy his sexual fantasies.",
      "Her testimony echoed what the jury heard in the trial's first week when Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura testified for four days that she engaged in hundreds of multiday \u201cfreak-offs\u201d while they dated from 2007 to 2018, having sex with male sex workers in front of Combs, who masturbated, filmed the encounters, and verbalized what he wanted to see sexually.",
      "Jane said she and Combs split up from Halloween 2023 until February 2024. During the break, she said, she flew on another famous rapper's private jet to Las Vegas, joining the celebrity to celebrate his romantic partner's birthday for a night that included dinner, a stripper's club visit and a hotel room party.",
      "In the hotel room, Jane testified, the rapper who was close friends with Combs made a pass at her amid flirtatious banter, saying he had always wanted to have sex with her. She said she danced in the hotel room, where a male sex worker was having sex with a woman, and at some point Jane flashed her breasts.",
      "Jane agreed with a lawyer's assessment that the famous rapper was \u201can individual at the top of the music industry as well ... an icon in the music industry.\u201d",
      "Jane also revealed that the unidentified famous rapper and his partner were looking for someone they could add to their sexual experiences who was \u201cin the lifestyle.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe they were asking me because maybe they just picked up the energy from me or I just maybe assumed that maybe they had already got an inclination that me and Sean had been doing kind of similar things,\u201d she said, noting that she referred a male sex worker she knew.",
      "A day after Jane finished testifying, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, made a surprise appearance at the courthouse and quickly learned what a tough ticket it is to get into the courtroom where his good friend Combs is on trial.",
      "Ye, wearing all white, was ushered by courthouse security to an overflow courtroom to watch the trial on a video monitor along with others who were unable to get into the courtroom. He lasted only a few minutes there before he made his courthouse exit, saying nothing during his trip except that he was there to support Combs.",
      "It turns out that Combs, the subject of several true-crime TV documentaries, is a bit of a true-crime fan himself.",
      "Jane revealed this week that his favorite show is \u201cDateline,\u201d the magazine-style NBC stalwart that is heavy on murders and mysteries.",
      "She told jurors that, in their alone time together, she and Combs would watch \u201cDateline\u201d for hours \u201ctill we fell asleep.\u201d",
      "Other activities when it was just the two of them included hugging, cuddling and bathing Combs, and giving him foot rubs, Jane testified.",
      "Jane testified that she last saw Combs in August, when they were in their \u201csame routine having sex and everything\u201d when Combs suggested that she invite over the very first male sex worker she had sex with in front of Combs.",
      "She said that afterward, she and Combs continued texting each other and were planning to meet in New York at a hotel in September.",
      "\u201cDid you end up going to New York to see him?\u201d she was asked. \u201cNo,\u201d she answered.",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d she was asked before she responded: \u201cBecause he got arrested.\u201d",
      "The courtroom rules surrounding Jane's testimony were the strictest yet in a bid to protect her identity from becoming common knowledge.",
      "But the rules imposed by the judge became too much for defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, who protested that Jane was blocked from telling more about the hotel party in January 2024 with the famous, though unidentified, rapper.",
      "Agnifilo said the defense had consented to the \u201cpseudonymity\u201d of Jane.",
      "\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t consent to, and we don\u2019t, most respectfully, is that these events which play important parts in the background of some of the most critical events in the trial, should be in any way not fully public,\u201d he said.",
      "He said names should have been released.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason that trials are fully public is so if other people realize they know something about an event that\u2019s discussed in a public courtroom, they could come forward and they could share whatever their recollection is about it,\u201d he said.",
      "The fate of one anonymous juror was in limbo after the judge said Friday he will reconsider his decision to oust the juror even though he suspects he might have an \"agenda.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian said he had decided that conflicting answers from the juror about where he primarily lived \u2014 in New Jersey or New York \u2014 raised questions about his credibility and whether he was answering questions in a bid to stay on the jury. If the juror does primarily live with a girlfriend in New Jersey, he would be outside the court district and disqualified.",
      "Prosecutors said the juror's dismissal is required because of his conflicting answers. Defense lawyers argued that prosecutors were only trying to disqualify a Black juror and that his dismissal could spoil an otherwise diverse panel of jurors.",
      "The judge bristled at the suggestion that race was a factor, saying there was no support for claims that prosecutors did not use race-neutral arguments to exclude jurors during jury selection and now.",

      "A federal program that provides benefits to the families of police and firefighters who die and become disabled on duty is rapidly growing while facing criticism for increasing delays in deciding claims",
      "A federal program that provides benefits to families of police officers and firefighters who die and become disabled on duty is rapidly growing while facing criticism for increasing delays in deciding claims.",
      "Congress created the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits program in 1976 to guarantee that the spouses and children of officers who put their lives on the line would receive financial support.",
      "But repeated expansions in eligibility approved by Congress, including three passed in the last five years, have made the program more popular and complex to administer. Critics say the program fails some families by taking too long to grant or deny benefits and making inconsistent rulings.",
      "An Associated Press analysis found that hundreds of families are waiting years to learn whether they qualify for payments, and more are ultimately being denied.",
      "New Jersey widow Sharline Volcy learned this month that she'd been awarded the benefits, more than 3 1/2 years after her husband, Ronald Donat, died while training at the Gwinnett County Police Academy in Georgia.",
      "Volcy said she was grateful for the aid, which will provide some financial security and help pay for her two daughters to go to college. But she said the long wait was stressful, when she was told time and again the claim remained under review and ultimately saw her inquiries ignored.",
      "\u201cThey told me they didn't know how long it would take because they don't have a deadline. That's the hardest thing to hear,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt defeated.\u201d",
      "She said lawyers didn't want to take the case, and a plea for help to her congressperson went nowhere. She said she'd given up hope and was lucky she had a job as an airport gate agent in the meantime.",
      "Volcy's experience isn't unique, and some cases take longer.",
      "As of late April, more than 120 claims by surviving relatives or disabled first responders have been awaiting initial determinations or rulings on their appeals for more than five years, according AP's findings. About a dozen have waited over a decade for an answer.",
      "The program has a goal of making determinations within one year but has not taken steps to track its progress, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report.",
      "But roughly three in 10 cases have not met that timeframe in recent years. As of late late April, 900 claims had been pending longer than one year. That includes claims from nearly every state.",
      "Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill to require the program to make determinations within 270 days.",
      "Over the last year, the denial rate has increased, with roughly one in three death and disability claims getting rejected.",
      "Applicants can appeal to a hearing officer and then the director if they choose, but that isn't common. Many say they can't afford attorneys or want to get on with their lives.",
      "Justice Department officials, who oversee the program, say they\u2019re making complicated decisions about whether cases meet legal criteria.",
      "\u201cDeath and disability claims involving complex medical and causation issues, voluminous evidence and conflicting medical opinions, take longer to determine, as do claims in various stages of appeal,\u201d they said in a statement.",
      "The program started as a simple $50,000 payout for the families of officers who were fatally shot on duty or died as a result of other violence or dangers.",
      "But Congress expanded the program in 1990 to cover some first responders who were disabled on duty, which made some determinations harder to reach. A 1998 law added educational benefits for the spouses and children of those deceased and disabled officers.",
      "Since 2020, Congress has passed three laws making many other types of deaths and disabilities eligible, including deaths related to COVID-19, deaths and injuries of those working rescue and cleanup operations after the September 2001 attacks, and responders who committed suicide under certain circumstances.",
      "Annual claims have more than doubled in the last five years, from 500 in 2019 to roughly 1,200 today.",
      "While many applicants have criticized the increasing delays, the leading group that represents the relatives of officers who die on duty has been silent.",
      "Critics say that\u2019s because the group, Concerns of Police Survivors, has a financial incentive not to criticize the program, which has awarded it tens of millions of dollars in grant funding in recent decades.",
      "The Missouri-based nonprofit recently received a new $6 million grant from the program to for its work with deceased officers\u2019 relatives, including counseling, hosting memorial events, educating agencies about the program and assisting with claims.",
      "The group\u2019s founder and retired executive director, Suzie Sawyer, said she was warned many years ago that fighting too hard for claimants could jeopardize its grant funding.",
      "But current spokesperson Sara Slone said advocacy isn't the group's mission and that it works \u201chand in hand\u201d with PSOB to assist applicants and provide education about benefits.",
      "Lisa Afolayan\u2019s husband died after a training exercise at the Border Patrol academy more than 16 years ago, but she\u2019s still fighting the program for benefits.",
      "An autopsy found that Nate Afolayan died from heat illness after completing a 1.5-mile test run in 88 degree heat, at a high altitude in the New Mexico desert.",
      "The program had awarded benefits to families after similar training deaths, dating back to an officer who died at an academy in 1988.",
      "But its independent investigation blamed Nate\u2019s death on sickle cell trait, a genetic condition that's usually benign but has been linked to rare exertion-related deaths in police, military and sports training.",
      "The program denied Lisa\u2019s claim and her subsequent appeals, arguing the death wasn't the result of heat along and didn't qualify.",
      "The program stood by its denial in 2024, even after a federal appeals court said it may have failed to adequately consider the weather\u2019s role and violated a law barring discrimination on the basis of genetic information.",
      "The appeals court is currently considering Lisa\u2019s second appeal, even as the couple\u2019s two children reach college age.",

      "The massive military parade that President Donald Trump has long wanted is set to step off from the Lincoln Memorial with tanks, bands and thousands of troops",
      "WASHINGTON -- The massive military parade that President Donald Trump has long wanted is set to step off from the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday evening, with tanks, bands and thousands of troops.",
      "And the biggest question marks are whether it will be overshadowed or delayed by either the weather in Washington or planned protests elsewhere around the country.",
      "Falling on Trump\u2019s 79th birthday, the parade was added just a few weeks ago to the Army\u2019s long-planned 250th anniversary celebration. It has triggered criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. The Army has taken a variety of steps to protect the streets, including laying metal plates down along the route.",
      "The daylong display of America\u2019s Army comes as Trump has shown his willingness to use his fighting forces in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided, inviting an array of lawsuits and accusations that he is politicizing the military.",
      "He has deployed the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests tied to immigration raids. It marks the first time in 60 years that a president activated the National Guard on federal orders inside a state without a governor\u2019s permission, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit to stop the deployments.",
      "Earlier in the week, Trump raised eyebrows during a speech at Fort Bragg when members of the 82nd Airborne Division were directed to stand behind Trump and they booed and cheered during his incendiary remarks, including condemnation of his predecessor, Joe Biden. There also was a pop-up \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d merchandise stand nearby selling souvenirs to troops in uniform.",
      "The Defense Department has a doctrine that prohibits troops from participating in political activity while in uniform. Members of Congress and military leaders have expressed concerns about the political displays during the speech at Fort Bragg.",
      "Trump so far has shrugged off concerns about the parade cost, the rainy forecast and the potential for protests.",
      "\u201cWhat a day it will be!!!\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site, adding later that he hoped the weather would cooperate but that if it doesn't, \u201cthat brings you good luck. That\u2019s OK too. Doesn\u2019t matter. Doesn\u2019t affect the tanks at all. Doesn\u2019t affect the soldiers. They\u2019re used to it. They\u2019re tough. Smart.\u201d",
      "As for the protests, he warned that \u201cthey will be met with very big force.\u201d",
      "The \u201cNo Kings\u201d rallies planned in hundreds of cities nationwide are meant to counter what organizers say are Trump\u2019s plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and Flag Day. No protests are scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., however, and officials have said they so far have no indication of any security threat.",
      "About 6 in 10 Americans say Saturday\u2019s parade is \u201cnot a good use\u201d of government money, including the vast majority of people, 78%, who neither approve nor disapprove of the parade overall, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "The parade will wind down Constitution Avenue, which is already lined with security fencing and barriers. Army helicopters and aircraft will fly above, and the march will be capped off by a parachute jump, a concert featuring \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.\u201d singer Lee Greenwood and fireworks.",
      "With rain expected, there is a chance the parade could be interrupted by thunderstorms.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly has said the march will go on rain or shine. But it could be delayed if there is lightning, with authorities quick to empty the expansive National Mall if it happens during major events.",
      "The parade fulfills Trump's expressed desire for a big parade that he tried to get done in his first presidential term after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "The Army expects as many as 200,000 people could attend the festival and parade. The festival will begin around 9:30 a.m. EDT and feature fitness competitions, demonstrations, equipment displays, music and a cake-cutting ceremony.",
      "The parade is set to begin at 6:30 p.m. EDT, but parts of it \u2014 including the horse-drawn caissons and other units \u2014 start at the Pentagon, head over a bridge and meet up with some of the heavier tanks and equipment. Officials did not want the more-than-60-ton M1A1 Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles crossing the bridge.",
      "Timed down to the minute, the march will be divided into sections by history \u2014 with equipment and troops in full dress from each period.",
      "It will include a total of 6,169 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery, while 62 aircraft fly overhead.",
      "At the end of the parade, Trump will swear in 250 new or reenlisting troops, and the Army's Golden Knights parachute team will jump onto the Mall. That will be followed by the concert and fireworks.",

      "\u201cIt just makes me so mad that we are having to fight this so hard,\u201d said Afolayan, whose husband, Nate, had been hired to guard the U.S. border with Mexico in southern California. \u201cIt takes a toll emotionally, and I don\u2019t think they care. To them, it\u2019s just a business. They\u2019re just pushing paper.\u201d",
      "Afolayan's case is part of a backlog of claims plaguing the fast-growing Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program. Hundreds of families of deceased and disabled officers are waiting years to learn whether they qualify for the life-changing payments, and more are ultimately being denied, an Associated Press analysis of program data found.",
      "The program is falling far short of its goal of deciding claims within one year. Nearly 900 have been pending for longer than that, triple the number from five years earlier, in a backlog that includes cases from nearly every state, according to AP\u2019s review, which was based on program data through late April.",
      "More than 120 of those claims have been in limbo for at least five years, and roughly a dozen have languished for a decade.",
      "\u201cThat is just outrageous that the person has to wait that long,\u201d said Charlie Lauer, the program's general counsel in the 1980s. \u201cThose poor families.\u201d",

      "Supporters say Lisa Afolayan's resilience in pursuing the claim has been remarkable, and grown in significance as training-related deaths like Nate\u2019s have risen.",
      "\u201cYour death must fit in their box, or your family\u2019s not going to be taken care of,\u201d said Afolayan, of suburban Dallas.",

      "Today, the program sees 1,200 claims annually, up from 500 in 2019.",
      "The wait time for decisions and rate of denials have risen alongside the caseload. Roughly one of every three death and disability claims were rejected over the last year.",
      "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and other Republicans recently introduced legislation to require the program to make determinations within 270 days, expressing outrage over the case of an officer disabled in a mass shooting who's waited years for a ruling. Similar legislation died last year.",

The Missouri-based nonprofit recently received a $6 million grant to continue its longstanding partnership with the Justice Department to serve deceased officers\u2019 relatives \u2014 including providing counseling, hosting memorial events and assisting with claims.",
      "\u201cWe are very appreciative of the PSOB and their work with survivor benefits,\u201d spokesperson Sara Slone said. \u201cNot all line-of-duty deaths are the same and therefore processing times will differ.\u201d",
      "Born in Nigeria, Nate Afolayan moved to California with relatives at age 11. He became a U.S. citizen and graduated from California State University a decade later.",
      "Lisa met Nate while they worked together at a juvenile probation office. They talked, went out for lunch and felt sparks.",
      "\u201cThe next thing you know, we were married with two kids,\u201d she said.",
      "He decided to pursue a career in law enforcement once their second daughter was born. Lisa supported him, though she understood the danger.",
      "He spent a year working out while applying for jobs and was thrilled when the Border Patrol declared him medically fit; sent him to Artesia, New Mexico, for training; and swore him in.",
      "Nate loved his 10 weeks at the academy, Lisa said, despite needing medical treatment several times \u2014 he was shot with pepper spray in the face and became dizzy during a water-based drill.",

      "But on April 30, 2009 \u2014 days before the ceremony \u2014 a Border Patrol official called Lisa. Nate, 29, had fainted after his final training run and was hospitalized.",
      "It was dusty and 88 degrees in the high desert that afternoon. Agents had to complete the 1.5-mile run in 13 minutes, at an altitude of 3,400 feet. Nate had warned classmates it was too hot to wear their black academy shirts, but they voted to do so anyway, records show.",
      "Nate, 29, finished in just over 11 minutes but then struggled to breathe and collapsed.",
      "Now Nate was being airlifted to a Lubbock, Texas, hospital for advanced treatment. Lisa booked a last-minute flight, arriving the next day.",
      "A doctor told her Nate\u2019s organs had shut down and they couldn't save his life. The hospital needed permission to end life-saving efforts. One nurse delivered chest compressions; another held Lisa tightly as she yelled: \u201cThat\u2019s it! I can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d",
      "Lisa became a single mother. The girls were 3 and 1.",
      "Her only comfort, she said, was knowing Nate died living his dream \u2014 serving his adopted country.",
      "When she first applied for benefits, Lisa included the death certificate that listed heat illness as the cause of Nate\u2019s death.",
      "The aid could help her family. She'd been studying to become a nurse but had to abandon that plan. She relied on Social Security survivors\u2019 benefits and workers\u2019 compensation while working at gyms as a trainer or receptionist and dabbling in real estate.",
      "The program had paid benefits for a handful of similar training deaths, dating to a Massachusetts officer who suffered heat stroke and dehydration in 1988. But program staff wanted another opinion on Nate\u2019s death. They turned to outside forensic pathologist Dr. Stephen Cina.",
      "Cina concluded the autopsy overlooked the \u201cmost significant factor\u201d: Nate carried sickle cell trait, a condition that's usually benign but has been linked to rare exertion-related deaths in military, sports and law enforcement training.",
      "Cina opined that exercising in a hot climate at high altitude triggered a crisis in which Nate\u2019s red blood cells became misshapen, depriving his body of oxygen. Cina, who stopped consulting for the benefits program in 2020 after hundreds of case reviews, declined to comment.",
      "Nate learned he had the condition, carried by up to 3 million U.S. Black citizens, after a blood test following his second daughter\u2019s birth. The former high school basketball player had never experienced any problems.",
      "A Border Patrol spokesperson declined to say whether academy leaders knew of the condition, which experts say can be managed with precautions such as staying hydrated, avoiding workouts in extreme temperatures and altitudes, and taking rest breaks.",
      "Under the benefit program\u2019s rules, Afolayan\u2019s death would need to be \u201cthe direct and proximate result\u201d of an injury he suffered on duty to qualify. It couldn't be the result of ordinary physical strain.",
      "The program in 2012 rejected the claim, saying the hot, dry, high climate was one factor, but not the most important.",
      "It had been more than two years since Lisa Afolayan applied and three since Nate's death.",
      "Most rejected applicants don\u2019t exercise their option to appeal to an independent hearing officer, saying they can't afford attorneys or want to get on with their lives.",
      "But Lisa Afolayan appealed with help from a border patrol union. A one-day hearing was held in late 2012. The hearing officer denied her claim more than a year later, saying the \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors causing the death didn't include a qualifying injury.",
      "Lisa and her daughters moved from California to Texas. They visited the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, where they saw Nate's name.",
      "Four years passed without an update on the claim. Lisa learned the union had failed to exercise its final appeal, to the program director, due to an oversight. The union didn't respond to AP emails seeking comment.",
      "Then she met Suzie Sawyer, founder and retired executive director of Concerns of Police Survivors. Sawyer had recently helped win a long battle to obtain benefits in the death of another federal agent who\u2019d collapsed during training.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Lisa, this could be the fight of your life, and it could take forever,'\" Sawyer recalled. \"'Are you willing to do it?\u2019 She goes, \u2018hell yes.\u2019\u201d",
      "The two persuaded the program to hear the appeal even though the deadline had passed. They introduced a list of similar claims that had been granted and new evidence: A Tennessee medical examiner concluded the hot, dry environment and altitude were key factors causing Nate\u2019s organ-system failure.",
      "But the program was unmoved. The acting Bureau of Justice Assistance director upheld the denial in 2020.",
      "Such rulings usually aren\u2019t public, but Lisa fumed as she learned through contacts about some whose deaths qualified, including a trooper who had an allergic reaction to a bee sting, an intoxicated FBI agent who crashed his car, and another officer with sickle cell trait who died after a training run on a hot day.",
      "In 2022, Lisa thought she might have finally prevailed when a federal appeals court ordered the program to take another look at her application.",
      "A three-judge panel said the program erred by failing to consider whether the heat, humidity and altitude during the run were \u201cthe type of unusual or out-of-the-ordinary climatic conditions that would qualify.\u201d",
      "The judges also said it may have been illegal to rely on sickle cell trait for the denial under a federal law prohibiting employers from discrimination on the basis of genetic information.",
      "It was great timing: The girls were in high school and could use the monthly benefit of $1,530 to help pay for college. The family\u2019s Social Security and workers\u2019 compensation benefits would end soon.",
      "But the program was in no hurry. Nearly two years passed without a ruling despite inquiries from Afolayan and her lawyer.",
      "The Bureau of Justice Assistance director upheld the denial in February 2024, ruling that the climate on that day 15 years earlier wasn\u2019t \u201cunusually adverse.\u201d The decision concluded the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act didn't apply since the program wasn\u2019t Afolayan\u2019s employer.",
      "Arnold & Porter, a Washington law firm now representing Afolayan pro bono, has appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.",
      "Her attorney John Elwood said the program has gotten bogged down in minutiae while losing sight of the bigger picture: that an officer died during mandatory training. He said government lawyers are fighting him just as hard, \u201cif not harder,\u201d than on any other case he\u2019s handled.",
      "Months after filing their briefs, oral arguments haven't been set.",
      "\u201cThis has been my life for 16 years,\u201d Lisa Afolayan said. \u201cSometimes I just chuckle and keep moving because what else am I going to do?\u201d",

      "The military parade to mark the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary and its convergence with President Donald Trump\u2019s 79th birthday are combining to create a peacetime outlier in U.S. history",
      "The military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary and its convergence with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday are combining to create a peacetime outlier in U.S. history. Yet it still reflects global traditions that serve a range of political and cultural purposes.",
      "Variations on the theme have surfaced among longtime NATO allies in Europe, one-party and authoritarian states and history's darkest regimes.",
      "The oldest democratic ally of the U.S. holds a military parade each July 14 to commemorate one of the seminal moments of the French Revolution. It inspired \u2014 or at least stoked \u2014 Trump's idea for a Washington version.",
      "On July 14, 1789, French insurgents stormed the Bastille, which housed prisoners of Louis XVI\u2019s government. Revolutionaries commenced a F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration as a day of national unity and pride the following year, even with the First French Republic still more than two years from being established.",
      "The Bastille Day parade has rolled annually since 1880. Now, it proceeds down an iconic Parisian route, the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. It passes the Arc de Triomphe \u2014 a memorial with tributes to the French Revolution, Napoleonic Wars and World War I \u2014 and eventually in front of the French president, government ministers and invited foreign guests.",
      "Trump attended in 2017, early in his first presidency, as U.S. troops marched as guests. The spectacle left him openly envious.",
      "\u201cIt was one of the greatest parades I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trump told French President Emanuel Macron. \u201cIt was military might, and I think a tremendous thing for France and for the spirit of France. We\u2019re going to have to try and top it.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, King Charles III serves as ceremonial (though not practical) head of U.K. armed forces. Unlike in France and the U.S., where elected presidents wear civilian dress even at military events, Charles dons elaborate dress uniforms \u2014 medals, sash, sword, sometimes even a bearskin hat and chin strap.",
      "He does it most famously at Trooping the Colour, a parade and troop inspection to mark the British monarch\u2019s official birthday, regardless of their actual birthdate. (The U.S. Army has said it has no specific plans to recognize Trump\u2019s birthday on Saturday.)",
      "In 2023, Charles\u2019 first full year as king, he rode on horseback to inspect 1,400 representatives of the most prestigious U.K. regiments. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, used a carriage over the last three decades of her 70-year reign.",
      "The British trace Trooping the Colour back to King Charles II, who reigned from 1660-1685. It became an annual event under King George III, described in the American colonists\u2019 Declaration of Independence as a figure of \u201cabsolute Despotism (and) Tyranny.\u201d",
      "Grandiose military pomp is common under modern authoritarians, especially those who have seized power via coups. It sometimes serves as a show of force meant to ward off would-be challengers \u2014 and to seek legitimacy and respect from other countries.",
      "Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro, who wore military garb routinely, held parades to commemorate the revolution he led on Dec. 2, 1959. In 2017, then-President Ra\u00fal Castro refashioned the event into a Fidel tribute shortly after his brother\u2019s death. Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, known as \u201cComandante Ch\u00e1vez,\u201d presided over frequent parades until his 2013 death. His successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has worn military dress at similar events.",
      "North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un, who famously bonded with Trump in a 2018 summit, used a 2023 military parade to show off his daughter and potential successor, along with pieces of his isolated country's nuclear arsenal. The event in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square \u2014 named for Kim's grandfather \u2014 marked the North Korean Army's 75th birthday. Kim watched from a viewing stand as missiles other weaponry moved by and goose-stepping soldiers marched past him chanting, \u201cDefend with your life, Paektu Bloodline\u201d \u2014 referring to the Kim family's biological ancestry.",
      "In China, Beijing's one-party government stages its National Day Parade every 10 years to project civic unity and military might. The most recent events, held in 2009 and 2019, involved trucks carrying nuclear missiles designed to evade U.S. defenses, as well as other weaponry.",
      "Legions of troops, along with those hard assets, streamed past President Xi Jinping and other leaders gathered in Tiananmen Square in 2019 as spectators waved Chinese flags and fighter jets flew above.",
      "Earlier this spring, Xi joined Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 another strongman leader Trump has occasionally praised \u2014 in Moscow's Red Square for the annual \u201cVictory Day\u201d parade. The May 9 event commemorates the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II \u2014 a global conflict in which China and the Soviet Union, despite not being democracies, joined the Allied Powers in fighting the Axis Powers led by Germany and Japan.",
      "Large civic-military displays were, of course, a feature in Nazi Germany and fascist Italy before and during World War II. Chilling footage of such events lives on as a reminder of the dangers of authoritarian extremism.",
      "Among those frequent occasions: a parade capping Germany\u2019s multiday observance of Adolf Hitler\u2019s 50th birthday in 1939. (Some far-right extremists in Europe still mark the anniversary of Hitler's birth.) The four-hour march through Berlin on April 20, 1939, included more than 40,000 personnel across the Army, Navy, Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Schutzstaffel (commonly known as the \u201cSS.\u201d) Hundreds of thousands of spectators lined the streets. The F\u00fchrer\u2019s invited guests numbered 20,000.",

      "The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture is one of the largest repositories of Black history in the country",
      "NEW YORK -- It\u2019s one of the largest repositories of Black history in the country \u2014 and its most devoted supporters say not enough people know about it. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture hopes to change that Saturday, as it celebrates its centennial with a festival combining two of its marquee annual events.",
      "The Black Comic Book Festival and the Schomburg Literary Festival will run across a full day and will feature readings, panel discussions, workshops, children\u2019s story times, and cosplay, as well as a vendor marketplace. Saturday\u2019s celebration takes over 135th Street in Manhattan between Malcom X and Adam Clayton Powell boulevards.",
      "Founded in New York City during the height of the Harlem Renaissance, the Schomburg Center will spend the next year exhibiting signature objects curated from its massive catalog of Black literature, art, recordings and films.",
      "Artists, writers and community leaders have gone the center to be inspired, root their work in a deep understanding of the vastness of the African diaspora, and spread word of the global accomplishments of Black people.",
      "It\u2019s also the kind of place that, in an era of backlash against race-conscious education and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, exists as a free and accessible branch of the New York Public Library system. It\u2019s open to the public during regular business hours, but its acclaimed research division requires an appointment.",
      "\u201cThe longevity the Schomburg has invested in preserving the traditions of the Black literary arts is worth celebrating, especially in how it sits in the canon of all the great writers that came beforehand,\u201d said Mahogany Brown, an author and poet-in-residence at the Lincoln Center, who will participate in Saturday's literary festival.",
      "For the centennial, the Schomburg\u2019s leaders have curated more than 100 items for an exhibition that tells the center\u2019s story through the objects, people, and the place \u2014 the historically Black neighborhood of Harlem \u2014 that shaped it. Those objects include a visitor register log from 1925-1940 featuring the signatures of Black literary icons and thought leaders, such as Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes; materials from the Fab 5 Freddy collection, documenting the earliest days of hip hop; and actor and director Ossie Davis\u2019s copy of the \u201cPurlie Victorious\u201d stage play script.",
      "An audio guide to the exhibition has been narrated by actor and literacy advocate LeVar Burton, the former host of the long-running TV show \u201cReading Rainbow.\u201d",
      "Whether they are new to the center or devoted supporters, visitors to the centennial exhibition will get a broader understanding of the Schomburg\u2019s history, the communities it has served, and the people who made it possible, said Joy Bivins, the Director of the Schomburg Center, who curated the centennial collection.",
      "\u201cVisitors will understand how the purposeful preservation of the cultural heritage of people of African descent has generated and fueled creativity across time and disciplines,\u201d Bivins said.",
      "Novella Ford, associate director of public programs and exhibitions, said the Schomburg Center approaches its work through a Black lens, focusing on Black being and Black aliveness as it addresses current events, theories, or issues.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re constantly connecting the present to the past, always looking back to move forward, and vice versa,\u201d Ford said.",
      "Still, many people outside the Schomburg community remain unaware of the center\u2019s existence \u2014 a concerning reality at a time when the Harlem neighborhood continues to gentrify around it and when the Trump administration is actively working to restrict the kind of race-conscious education and initiatives embedded in the center\u2019s mission.",
      "\u201cWe amplify scholars of color,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s about reawakening. It gives us the tools and the voice to push back by affirming the beauty, complexity, and presence of Black identity.\u201d",
      "The Schomburg Center has 11 million items in one of the oldest and largest collections of materials documenting the history and culture of people of African descent. That\u2019s a credit to founder Arturo Schomburg, an Afro-Latino historian born to a German father and African mother in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was inspired to collect materials on Afro-Latin Americans and African American culture after a teacher told him that Black people lacked major figures and a noteworthy history.",
      "Schomburg moved to New York in 1891 and, during the height of the Harlem Renaissance in 1926, sold his collection of approximately 4,000 books and pamphlets to the New York Public Library. Selections from Schomburg\u2019s personal holdings, known as the seed library, are part of the centennial exhibition.",
      "Ernestine Rose, who was the head librarian at the 135th Street branch, and Catherine Latimer, the New York Public Library\u2019s first Black librarian, built on Schomburg\u2019s donation by documenting Black culture to reflect the neighborhoods around the library.",
      "Today, the library serves as a research archive of art, artifacts, manuscripts, rare books, photos, moving images, and recorded sound. Over the years, it has grown in size, from a reading room on the third floor to three buildings that include a small theater and an auditorium for public programs, performances and movie screenings.",
      "Tammi Lawson, who has been visiting the Schomburg Center for over 40 years, recently noticed the absence of Black women artists in the center\u2019s permanent collection. Now, as the curator of the arts and artifacts division, she is focused on acquiring works by Black women artists from around the world, adding to an already impressive catalog at the center.",
      "\u201cPreserving Black art and artifacts affirms our creativity and our cultural contributions to the world,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWhat makes the Schomburg Center\u2019s arts and artifacts division so unique and rare is that we started collecting 50 years before anyone else thought to do it. Therefore, we have the most comprehensive collection of Black art in a public institution.\u201d",
      "For years, the Schomburg aimed to uplift New York\u2019s Black community through its Junior Scholars Program, a tuition-free program that awards dozens of youth from 6th through 12th grade. The scholars gain access to the center\u2019s repository and use it to create a multimedia showcase reflecting the richness, achievements, and struggles of today\u2019s Black experience.",
      "It\u2019s a lesser-known aspect of the Schomburg Center\u2019s legacy. That\u2019s in part because some in the Harlem community felt a divide between the institution and the neighborhood it purports to serve, said Damond Haynes, a former coordinator of interpretive programs at the center, who also worked with the Junior Scholars Program. But Harlem has changed since Haynes started working for the program about two decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe Schomburg was like a castle,\u201d Haynes said. \"It was like a church, you know what I mean? Only the members go in. You admire the building.\u201d",
      "For those who are exposed to the center's collections, the impact on their sense of self is undeniable, Haynes said. Kids are learning about themselves like Black history scholars, and it's like many families are passing the torch in a right of passage, he said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the teens, the avenues that they pick during the program, media, dance, poetry, visual art, they end up going into those programs,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cA lot the teens actually find their identity within the program.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Shortly after they began guarding a Los Angeles federal building Friday, U.S. Marines detained a man who had walked onto the property and did not immediately hear their commands to stop.",
      "The brief detention marked the first time federal troops have detained a civilian since they were deployed to the nation's second-largest city by President Donald Trump in response to protests over the administration's immigration arrests. The Marines were activated earlier this week but began their duties Friday.",
      "The man, Marcos Leao, was later released without charges and said the Marines were just doing their jobs.",

      "Leao\u2019s detention shows how the troops' deployment is putting them closer to carrying out law enforcement actions. Already, National Guard soldiers have been providing security on raids as Trump has promised as part of his immigration crackdown.",

      "A judge has blocked New York City\u2019s mayor from letting federal immigration authorities reopen an office at the city\u2019s main jail",
      "NEW YORK -- A judge blocked New York City\u2019s mayor from letting federal immigration authorities reopen an office at the city\u2019s main jail, in part because of concerns the mayor invited them back in as part of a deal with the Trump administration to end his corruption case.",
      "New York Judge Mary Rosado\u2019s decision Friday is a setback for Democratic Mayor Eric Adams, who issued an executive order permitting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies to maintain office space at the Rikers Island jail complex. City lawmakers filed a lawsuit in April accusing Adams of entering into a \u201ccorrupt quid pro quo bargain\u201d with the Trump administration in exchange for the U.S. Justice Department dropping criminal charges against him.",
      "Rosado temporarily blocked the executive order in April. In granting a preliminary injunction, she said city council members have \u201cshown a likelihood of success in demonstrating, at minimum, the appearance of a quid pro quo whereby Mayor Adams publicly agreed to bring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201dICE\u201d) back to Rikers Island in exchange for dismissal of his criminal charges.\u201d",
      "Rosado cited a number of factors, including U.S. border czar Tom Homan's televised comments in February that if Adams did not come through, \"I\u2019ll be in his office, up his butt saying, \u2018Where the hell is the agreement we came to?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Adams has repeatedly denied making a deal with the administration over the criminal case. He has said he deputized his first deputy mayor, Randy Mastro, to handle decision-making on the return of ICE to Rikers Island to make sure there was no appearance of any conflict of interest.",
      "Rosado said that Mastro reports to Adams and \u201ccannot be considered impartial and free from Mayor Adams' conflicts.\u201d",
      "Mastro said in a prepared statement Friday the administration was confident they will prevail in the case.",
      "\"Let\u2019s be crystal clear: This executive order is about the criminal prosecution of violent transnational gangs committing crimes in our city. Our administration has never, and will never, do anything to jeopardize the safety of law-abiding immigrants, and this executive order ensures their safety as well,\" Mastro said.",
      "City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is running in the Democratic primary for mayor, called the decision a victory for public safety.",
      "\u201cNew Yorkers are counting on our city to protect their civil rights, and yet, Mayor Adams has attempted to betray this obligation by handing power over our city to Trump\u2019s ICE because he is compromised,\" she said in a prepared statement.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order paving the way for a Nippon Steel investment in U.S. Steel, so long as the Japanese company complies with a \u201cnational security agreement\u201d submitted by the federal government.",
      "Trump's order didn\u2019t detail the terms of the national security agreement.",
      "But the iconic American steelmaker and Nippon Steel said in a joint statement that the agreement stipulates that approximately $11 billion in new investments will be made by 2028 and includes giving the U.S. government a \u201c golden share \" \u2014 essentially veto power to ensure the country's national security interests are protected against cutbacks in steel production.",
      "\u201cWe thank President Trump and his Administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,\" the two companies said. \"This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\u201d",
      "The companies have completed a U.S. Department of Justice review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, the statement said.",
      "\u201cThe partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,\u201d the statement said.",
      "U.S. Steel rose $2.66, or 5%, to $54.85 in afterhours trading Friday. Nippon Steel's original bid to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel in late 2023 had been valued at $55 per share.",
      "The companies offered few details on how the golden share would work, what other provisions are in the national security agreement and how specifically the $11 billion would be spent.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said the order \u201censures U.S. Steel will remain in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and be safeguarded as a critical element of America\u2019s national and economic security.\u201d",
      "James Brower, a Morrison Foerster lawyer who represents clients in national security-related matters, said such agreements with the government typically are not disclosed to the public, particularly by the government.",
      "They can become public, but it's almost always disclosed by a party in the transaction, such as a company \u2014 like U.S. Steel \u2014 that is publicly held, Brower said.",
      "The mechanics of how a golden share would work will depend on the national security agreement, but in such agreements it isn't unusual to give the government approval rights over specific activities, Brower said.",
      "U.S. Steel made no filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.",
      "Nippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.",
      "Nippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "Trump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would as president have \u201ctotal control\u201d of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.",
      "Trump said then that the deal would preserve \u201c51% ownership by Americans,\u201d although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.",
      "\u201cWe have a golden share, which I control,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump added that he was \u201ca little concerned\u201d about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, \u201cbut that gives you total control.\u201d",
      "The proposed merger had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "The order signed Friday by Trump said the CFIUS review provided \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Nippon Steel \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,\u201d but such risks might be \u201cadequately mitigated\u201d by approving the proposed national security agreement.",
      "The order doesn't detail the perceived national security risk and only provides a timeline for the national security agreement. The White House declined to provide details on the terms of the agreement.",
      "The order said the draft agreement was submitted to U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel on Friday. The two companies must successfully execute the agreement as decided by the Treasury Department and other federal agencies that are part CFIUS by the closing date of the transaction.",

      "A top election official is suing over allegations that the Maricopa County governing board is trying to gain more control over how elections are administered",
      "PHOENIX -- The top elections official in one of the nation\u2019s most pivotal swing counties is suing the Maricopa County governing board over allegations that it's attempting to gain more control over how elections are administered.",
      "County Recorder Justin Heap filed a lawsuit Thursday in state court with the backing of America First Legal, a conservative public interest group founded by Stephen Miller, who is now the White House deputy chief of staff.",
      "Heap, a former GOP state lawmaker who has questioned election administration in Arizona's most populous county, has been at odds with the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors for months over an agreement that would divide election operations between the two offices.",
      "After taking office in January, Heap terminated a previous agreement that was reached between his predecessor and the board. He claimed in his lawsuit it would have restrained his power to run elections by reducing funding and IT resources for the recorder's office.",
      "Last year's agreement also gave the board authority over early ballot processing, which drew criticism from Heap in his lawsuit.",
      "Heap is asking the court to undo what the lawsuit calls \u201cunlawful\u201d actions by the board and to issue an order requiring the board to fund expenses he deems necessary.",
      "\u201cDespite their repeated misinformation and gaslighting of the public on these issues, defending the civil right to free, fair and honest elections for every Maricopa County voter isn\u2019t simply my job as county recorder, it\u2019s the right thing to do and a mission I\u2019m fully committed to achieving,\u201d Heap said in a statement Thursday.",
      "The board's chair and vice chair have called the legal challenge frivolous, saying Heap is wasting taxpayer money by going to court.",
      "Negotiations between the offices have been ongoing since the beginning of the year, and the board said in a statement that it appeared things were going well after a meeting in April. It was only weeks later, the board said, that Heap came back with what he called a final offer that included dozens of changes.",
      "Heap claims in the lawsuit that the board rejected his proposed agreement in late May. In a statement, America First Legal says the board separately voted on a tentative budget that shifts Heap's key duties and underfunds the recorder's office.",
      "\u201cFrom day one, Recorder Heap has been making promises that the law doesn\u2019t allow him to keep,\" Board Chairman Thomas Galvin said. \"Arizona election statutes delineate election administration between county boards of supervisors and recorders to ensure there are checks and balances, and Recorder Heap clearly doesn\u2019t understand the responsibilities of his position.\u201d",
      "Following President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 loss, Maricopa County became an epicenter for election conspiracy theories. Heap has stopped short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen, but he has said the state\u2019s practices for handling early ballots are insecure and has questioned how ballots are transported, handled and stored after they are submitted. Last year, Heap proposed an unsuccessful bill to remove Arizona from a multistate effort to maintain voter lists.",
      "Heap's predecessor, Stephen Richer, was rebuked in some GOP circles for defending the legitimacy of the 2020 and 2022 elections, in which Democrats including former President Joe Biden and Gov. Katie Hobbs won by razor-thin margins. Trump won Arizona in 2024, along with the other battleground states.",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:20:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

    "story": [
      "For half a century, Beach Boys songs like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"  have promised unending summers of fun in the sun -- not at all like the life founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson actually led for many years, as Anthony Mason tells us now in our Sunday Profile:",
      "On a warm summer night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last month, Brian Wilson -- backed by a band that included fellow former Beach Boy Al Jardine -- was running through his repertoire of classics when a cake was wheeled out from backstage by the extended Wilson family.",
      "On this night, the man many regard as one of America's greatest living songwriters turned 73.",
      "Well, East coast girls are hip, \tI really dig those styles they wear. \tAnd the Southern girls, with the way they talk, \tThey knock me out when I'm down there. \tThe Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright. \tAnd the Northern girls with the way they kiss \tThey keep their boyfriends warm at night.",
      "I wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California girls.",
      "-- \"California Girls,\" by Brian Wilson and Mike Love (1965)",
      "Wilson, who created the sun & surf sound that's still the soundtrack for the American summer, has had a summer of milestones. On tour again, he has just released his 11th solo album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" and is the subject of a new film about his life, \"Love & Mercy.\"",
      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",
      "The song \"One Kind of Love,\" on Brian Wilson's new album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" is dedicated to Melinda.  (To hear Wilson perform the song click on the video player below.)",
      "Just driftwood floating on the sea, \tSearching for the me and all that I have known to be. \tThank God that you noticed me, \tAnd brought back harmony to this lonely soul.",
      "Mason asked, \"How important was Melinda in you getting through that?\"",
      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",
      "\"He is really strong -- people don't get that about him,\" Melinda said. \"They think he's passive and just sits around. But he's strong.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment when you knew you'd actually won?\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "As a founding member of the '60s rock group the Beach Boys, singer-songwriter Brian Wilson (June 20, 1942-June 11, 2025) created the sun & surf sound that has been the soundtrack of summer ever since.",
      "It began in 1961, on Labor Day weekend, when Wilson's parents went out of town. Using the money they'd left for food, Wilson and his brothers decided to rent some musical instruments. \"And then we starved, but we had a good, you know, time,\" Wilson told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002.",
      "\"We\" was Wilson; his brothers, Dennis and Carl; cousin Mike Love; and their buddy, Al Jardine.",
      "\"Surfing,\" the song they recorded that day under the name the Pendletons, went to #1 on the local charts. [It was helped by their own multiple calls to the radio station, changing their voices to impersonate masses of listeners.] It landed them a record contract, and their promotion manager suggested a new name \u2014 the Beach Boys \u2014 which the group didn't learn of until the record was released.",
      "\"Surfin' Safari\" was the first of their 29 studio albums. And never mind that Brian Wilson himself never surfed; his songs like \"Surfin',\" \"Dance, Dance, Dance,\" \"California Girls,\" \"I Get Around,\" \"Fun, Fun, Fun,\" \"Surfer Girl,\" \"Help Me, Rhonda,\" \"Good Vibrations,\" \"Barbara Ann,\" and \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" (for which Wilson rewrote the lyrics from Chuck Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\") were instrumental in conjuring the \"California Sound\" \u2014 music evocative of carefree days at the beach \u2014 which earned them 35 Top 40 hits.",
      "Their manager, the Wilsons' father, Murray, drove them hard. \"He was a huge problem,\" Love told \"Sunday Morning in 2012. \"Emotionally, he was abusive, emotionally and physically to his kids, and he was unbearable at times. Brian and I'd actually fired him.\" But Brian admitted he also pushed himself hard. \"Yeah, I drove myself. I wanted to be a perfectionist,\" he said. In 1964, Wilson suffered a nervous breakdown, quit touring, and retreated to the studio, while the rest of the group stayed on the road.",
      "Wilson's songs were more harmonically and texturally complex than most pop music. Like the Beatles, who were the Beach Boys' most obvious artistic competitors, Wilson used rich vocal harmonics, orchestral and electronic instruments, and studio overdubbing to create dense textures on albums such as 1966's \"Pet Sounds\" (his response to the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\"). With songs connected by themes of love and loss (such as \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows\"), \"Pet Sounds\" was named by Rolling Stone magazine the second greatest album of all time. But it was a source of contention within the band itself. \"Mike and the guys didn't like it,\" Wilson told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "But by the late 1960s, Wilson was struggling to write \u2014 his follow-up album to \"Pet Sounds,\" called \"Smile,\" was shelved \u2014 and he plunged into a severe depression. The band splintered. He was plagued by substance abuse and obesity. Along the way, Wilson's marriage fell apart, and he was estranged from his daughters, Carnie and Wendy (who, with another daughter of rock legends, Chynna Phillips, formed the trio Wilson Phillips).",
      "In desperation, Wilson went under the round-the-clock care of an unorthodox psychologist, Eugene Landy, whose years-long grip on the songwriter was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Wilson's will had been revised, with Landy named as his main beneficiary. They won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient.",
      "Eventually, Wilson got well enough to record again. He released 13 solo albums beginning in 1988, and performed with Carnie and Wendy. He also had to come to terms with the deaths of his brothers, Dennis (in a 1983 drowning) and Carl (in 1998, from cancer). He married Melinda Ledbetter in 1995, and they had five adopted children together.",
      "And in 2012, to mark the band's 50th anniversary, Brian Wilson reunited with Beach Boys members Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks and Bruce Johnston for a Grammys appearance. And when they returned to the studio together for the first time in nearly two decades to make a new album, \"That's Why God Made the Radio,\" the bitterness had fallen away \u2014\u00a0and the good vibrations were back."

Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety. Some have ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. One says he previously invested in a vaccine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy \"has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints\" on the panel and said that ethics agreements would be made public for the new members before they begin work for the ACIP.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Pediatrician Dr. Vincent Iannelli questioned Pebsworth's objectivity in a post Wednesday on his Vaxopedia website, citing a 2009 blog post where she described her advocacy on the issue.",
      "\"For those of us within the vaccine-injured communities who are fighting on behalf of our children for the basic human right to make voluntary, informed vaccination decisions that are based on sound science rather than ideology, it is a battle. And it is personal,\" Pebsworth wrote.",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "In an interview Levi shared on social media after the announcement, he said he would \"keep an open mind,\" but also stood by his previous call for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 shots to be suspended.",
      "\"I think it's obvious that these mRNA vaccines should not be given to anybody young or healthy. It is also not at all clear to me that they should be given to anybody, based on the evidence,\" he said.",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "In 2021, Levi spoke at a meeting of the FDA's outside vaccine advisers during its public comment session, opposing a broad authorization of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "An article co-authored by Levi in 2022\u00a0raised \"concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects\" based on data from Israeli emergency calls.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0this year for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "A spokesperson for Virginia Commonwealth University, Leila Ugincius, said Ross \"was an affiliate faculty member\" through the university's regional campus at Inova, a hospital system in the D.C. area, before a partnership with the hospital ended in 2021.",
      "Ross\u00a0is listed as cosigning an open letter during the COVID-19 pandemic that criticized a study that concluded ivermectin was ineffective for treating the disease. The University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy\u00a0previously reported Ross had backed the letter.",
      "\"We oppose this fixation on randomized controlled trials at the expense of other clinical and scientific evidence and urge medical policymakers to restore balance to the practice of medicine,\" the letter said.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner. The firm said Ross is a pediatrics professor, not an obstetrics and gynecology professor.",
      "Maryland-based Manta Pharma\u00a0had until Thursday listed\u00a0Ross as a medical adviser. On a LinkedIn\u00a0profile\u00a0that had been linked by the company, Ross said he worked for and served on advisory boards for several medical companies, including \"an investment in a vaccine company.\"",
      "HHS, Havencrest Capital Management and Manta Pharma did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "A blog and X account with Pagano's name from several years ago wrote about a range of issues, like\u00a0voicing disappointment over Republicans failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but says little about vaccines.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. He previously participated in federal panels related to his work, including the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.",
      "Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "They concluded that there was \"no consistent evidence from this study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury\" in causing autism, and that \"the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences\" caused by mercury exposure.",
      "A 2023 presentation by Hibbeln about seafood intake in pregnancy listed him as a professor at the University of Bristol and a psychiatrist for California-based Mindful Health Solutions.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year. He said none of his suggestions were among Kennedy's picks.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",
      "\"We're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine,\" he said.",
      "In an \"FAQ\" document shared with stakeholder groups, HHS said the department intended \"to ensure balanced membership in terms of the points of view represented.\"",

      "Stocks closed lower on Friday and oil prices climbed after a military strike by Israel on Iran stirred investor fears about the risk of war breaking out in the Middle East.",
      "The S&P 500 slid 68 points, or 1.1%, to end the day at 5,977, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 770 points, or 1.8%, to 42,198 points. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.3%.",
      "The market slide comes after\u00a0Israel launched strikes\u00a0on Iran's nuclear sites and other targets early Friday, the start of what Israel said could be a days-long attack. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones, which Israel claimed it was able to mostly intercept.",
      "The strikes come as President Trump seeks to rein in Iran's nuclear capabilities. The U.S. and Iran are scheduled to meet Sunday in Oman, as part of a series on ongoing talks.",
      "\"The initial market response has been largely contained, but the risk of a broader military conflict certainly cannot be dismissed,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"Iran has begun to retaliate and will continue to do so. This phase of the conflict will likely last several weeks at least.\"",
      "The oil market had an even stronger reaction on Friday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil increasing 7.3% to $72.98. Bent crude, the international standard, climbed 7% to $74.23 for a barrel. A deepening conflict could impact the flow of oil from Iran, a major producer of crude, according to analysts.",
      "One concern is that Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic channel through which millions of barrels of oil flow each day. For now, that option may be off the table for now, according to Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial.",
      "\"We think this is unlikely for now given Iran's need to maintain oil sales to China,\" Kerr said in an email.",

      "Rare earth minerals, which are a set of 17 metallic elements, are integral to automobile production, and enable features like windshield wipers, seat belts and speakers to function. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Geological Survey.",
      "China has leveraged its grip on rare earths and their widespread utility amid a trade war with the U.S. In April, Beijing announced greater export controls on the materials \u2014 a sticking point in tariff negotiations \u2014 along with other retaliatory trade measures. The controls require businesses to apply for a license to export rare earths, which U.S. automakers say they have been struggling to secure.",
      "Earlier this week, on June 11, following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S.",

      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Air India plane crash on Thursday is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft that crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad with 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Boeing says the 787-8 is the aviation industry's \"best-selling passenger widebody of all time,\" carrying more than 1 billion passengers since it was first delivered to airlines in 2011.",
      "What caused the crash remains unclear, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident. A senior Indian police official told the country's national news agency, ANI, that one\u00a0person survived the crash.",
      "\"The NTSB will be leading a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to assist the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with its investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India, Thursday,\" the National Transportation Safety Board said in a social media post.",
      "In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said the local government leads an investigation when it occurs in that country. \"In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support. We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",
      "Boeing said it is in contact with Air India about the crash and stands \"ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.\"",
      "Shares of Boeing fell $10.32, or 4.8%, to $203.59 in early trading.",
      "First crash of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner",
      "The Air India incident represents the first crash of a 787-8 Dreamliner, although the aircraft has been involved in previous investigations.",
      "The aircraft was designed by Boeing to handle longer nonstop routes, which the company says had opened up 425 new routes around the world since the aircraft was introduced.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last year ordered inspections of the cockpit seats on the Dreamliners after one of the jets went into a dive when the captain's seat lurched forward without warning and disconnected the plane's autopilot system, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Last year, a whistleblower's allegations prompted the FAA to investigate his claims about assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",
      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Air India said there was a \"sole survivor\" of the crash who was being treated at a hospital.",
      "\"The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off. We regret to inform that, of the 242 aboard, there are 241 confirmed fatalities. The sole survivor is being treated in a hospital,\" the airline\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement Thursday on social media.",
      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people. A January incident in which a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in January of 2024 fueled further concerns.",
      "Boeing posted a 2024 loss of $11.8 billion, bringing its total losses since 2019 to more than $35 billion.",
      "In May, the aircraft manufacturer\u00a0reached a $1.1 billion deal\u00a0with the Department of Justice that allows it to avoid prosecution for the crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019.",
      "An April 2025 analysis of commercial jet safety from Boeing shows that the airline industry has improved its overall safety record over the past several decades, although there was an increase in accidents in 2024. According to the report, there were 47 accidents last year across the airline industry, including 12 hull losses, and 187 fatalities.",
      "A hull loss can indicate an airplane is completely destroyed or damaged and not repaired, the report said. It can also indicate an airplane is missing and the wreckage hasn't been found.",

    "story": [
      "Americans often voice frustration\u00a0over the ubiquity of tipping these days, but that hasn't stopped them from giving generously to reward good service.",
      "Consumers spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars and other eateries in 2023, according to a new study by LendingTree. The analysis, which draws on the most recent government data available, gives readers a snapshot of how much Americans tip and in which states they tip the most.",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, LendingTree found that tipping rates tend to be higher in states where people eat out more. LendingTree also looked at which Americans around the country drop the biggest tips.",
      "Where do people tip the most?",
      "New Hampshire residents are the No. 1 tippers in the country, according to the LendingTree study. On average, they leave a gratuity of 16.07% of spending on food away from home \u2014 falling within the standard range of 15% to 20% tips at restaurants. New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 that includes full-service restaurants as well as fast-food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",
      "\"If people in one state tend to dine at full-service restaurants far more often than those in another state, it stands to reason their overall percentage spent on tips would be higher,\" LendingTree Chief Consumer Financial Analyst Matt Schulz wrote in the study.",
      "After New Hampshire, residents of Washington, D.C., are the nation's biggest tippers. People in the U.S. capital on average tip 12.65% when eating out.",

Typically as we move into summer, demand for eggs soften as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People aren't making heavy breakfasts, so we don't see demand for eggs being as strong as it typically is during the winter months.\"",
      "While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, down from $6.23 a dozen in March, they remain elevated compared with 12 months ago. In May 2024, a dozen eggs cost $2.70.",
      "David Ortega, a food economics professor at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch that containing avian flu explains most of the drop in egg prices.",
      "\"This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of commercial facilities that have been impacted by the bird flu,\" he said. \"A lot of bird flu activity in the beginning of the year led to a significant surge in egg prices, but those impacts have really lessened over the past couple of months.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 15, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now in Washington by Senator Tom Cotton, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you are staying on top of all these events. When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is not America's fight, unless Iran hits the U.S. Should it be such a bright line?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, what the President said in his overnight post was a clear message to the Ayatollahs, that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the US military in a way no one's ever seen. That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program poses to Israel and to the United States, because let's remember, the Iranian regime has been terrorizing Americans. It's killed thousands of Americans. It's taken them hostage. It still chants \"death to America,\" it's building missiles that can strike not just our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well. And that's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life that we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months. But as he said early last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. And I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. It was Iran's- Iran's stubbornness that ended them. President Trump was clear about that, and he is still clear that there is time if they want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would accept that. But he's given them chance after chance, as he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the line, he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military operations?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I don't think he's drawn that line. He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to support Israel--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He hasn't said that--",
      "SEN. COTTON: But he- well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment. He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death or there will be bombing. So, I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that we back Israel to the hilt. There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time. So of course, we're going to protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world. And he said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term and in this term as well. So, we back Israel to the hilt all the way. But he's appropriately keeping all options on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us. This isn't America. This isn't an American operation.",
      "SEN. COTTON: So far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over the years, or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel. Now he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament, and he has said that that can happen still through a deal, I don't think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --He prefers diplomacy.",
      "SEN. COTTON: And he would like Iran to come back to the table. I think now that Iran sees that Israel and America mean business and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. If that doesn't happen, though, I think the strikes are going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain. It's long been assessed that only the U.S. has the capability with a bunker buster bomb to take it out. Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordnance penetrator to Israel to finish the job?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might use--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But should they?--",
      "SEN. COTTON: --to protect our own interests. I'll simply say this, it is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. It doesn't have those 30,000 pound penetrating munitions. But as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night, when the Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has more than a few tricks up their sleeve, and I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the U.S. intelligence that was made public in March said at the time the U.S. does not assess Iran's building a nuclear weapon, and that the supreme leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended back in 2003. Was there more recent US intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind of sprint for a bomb? Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of the uranium to near weapons-grade over the four years of the Biden administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But that's not weaponization, you know that--",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- They are- they are close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons. Now that's not the only step to having a weapon. You also have to have the weapon design. We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. And then if you want to use a missile, obviously you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. But Iran has other delivery methods as well, through terrorist proxies. So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu thought we- things that were coming to a head. A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month. And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But why Thursday night?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, as President-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- There seems to be a difference in this--",
      "SEN. COTTON: --Well as President--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --idea of a sprint.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, as President Trump said on Friday morning that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal. That was day 61--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And he scheduled talks on day 63 you know that. I mean, this was a, this wasn't really a hard deadline.",
      "SEN. COTTON: He gave them 60 days. On day 61 the strikes began.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Day 63, Steve Witkoff wanted to meet with him. But if this was a covert race to weaponize, though it- it raises questions here, because it appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place in Iran. Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? Do you support his push for diplomacy?",
      "SEN. COTTON: President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program, which means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. This would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well on Iran not having a nuclear weapon. We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. We've seen their campaign of terror against Americans over the decades. That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon. And presidents have said for 20 years, presidents have said that. George Bush said it didn't act on it, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, frankly, aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not enforcing that line. It is Israel that's bombing. As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations--",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- But in Israel, we are helping- we're--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Do you- but do you share the President's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Iranian people to rise up against?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. They are today what they were Thursday morning, before these strikes started. As the President has said repeatedly, they can make a deal, or there's going to be bombing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to some domestic issues, but very quickly, I know in the past, you have said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue to receive security. President Trump pulled it. Should they get it now?",
      "SEN. COTTON: We should probably revisit the threat that all persons face. Remember, President Trump faced assassination threats from Iran as well. In this moment of tension to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that security detail was pulled by the president himself. On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. Do you support this decision?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement. I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal migrant working. Usually, it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working in their work sites. And whatever work site it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President has pulled back from that. That was the change in policy last week when it came to farms, in particular.",
      "SEN. COTTON: I don't think we should pull back on any kind of enforcement at all. I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, which could impact the economy?",
      "SEN. COTTON: We should not declare any industry or any work site that uses large numbers of illegal immigrants off-limits for enforcement of federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about the enforcement to date. As you know, there has been outcry. We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to California. You referred to it as the threat from the radical left , an overwhelming show of force to end the riots, and talked about communities being terrorized. Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes, when you see left wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles at police officers and shooting them with fireworks, and unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to maintain order, the next step is to call in the National Guard, and if the governor won't call on the National Guard, then the President has to federalize them. We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. But if they can't, or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent, yesterday, they fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control.",
      "SEN. COTTON: The LA police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed, and they couldn't manage the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today. Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 15:26:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California was briefly detained last week after being forcibly removed from a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California warned Sunday that if he, as a U.S. senator, could be forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security news conference, \"don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there\" to others.",
      "\"If that's how this administration responds to the senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there, to people without a title like United States senator, that cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better,\" Padilla said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Padilla was removed on Thursday from a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles amid ongoing immigration raids and protests in the city. Last week, President Trump overrode California Gov. Gavin Newsom and sent in the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell the protests.",
      "Noem was describing what she called the \"burdensome leadership\" of California's governor and the mayor of Los Angeles, when Padilla interrupted and attempted to ask a question before being pushed from the room. He could be heard yelling, \"I'm Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,\" as he was forcefully escorted out of the room.",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and throughout the country expressed shock at the treatment of a U.S. senator, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the incident \"horrible\" and \"not the America I know.\"",
      "Noem told reporters afterward that she \"wished that he would have reached out and identified himself and let us know who he was and that he wanted to talk.\"",
      "Los Angeles was among more than 2,000 cities nationwide that held protests Saturday against the Trump administration, which in L.A. resulted in police dispersing the crowd. Los Angeles Police Department officers said on a post to X that \"people in the crowd are throwing rocks, bricks, bottles and other objects\" when the march passed by the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. Newsom on Saturday accused the Defense Department of using old images to promote the military presence.",
      "Padilla said Sunday that last week, he was supposed to have his own briefing with the same representatives of Northern Command in the same building as Noem's media event, but it was delayed due to the news conference. He said he asked if he could listen in because he does not feel Noem has provided \"substantive answers\" to questions to Congress, whether it be in formal requests via letters or in testimony before Congress.",
      "\"So to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it,\" Padilla said.",
      "Padilla said he wanted to ask about \"their justification for the federalization of the National Guard,\" which he considers \"not only not necessary, but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles.\"",
      "He also said he wanted to ask about the increasing number of stories of people who are \"undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families\" being targeted for deportation.",
      "Padilla said a \"key question\" he had for Noem was about how many criminals are being deported, which is who the Trump administration has claimed to be targeting.",
      "\"Of course, she had no data, had no answer,\" Padilla said. \"Promised to follow up. I hope, we'll see.\"",
      "Padilla added that it was the same reaction when he had the \"audacity to try to ask a question as a senator of a Cabinet secretary.\"",
      "\"The vast majority of people in that room knew who I was,\" Padilla said. \"I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard member. It's the Los Angeles press corps. It said United States Senate on the chest of my polo.\"",
      "Noem told reporters afterward that she and Padilla met after the incident and had a \"very productive\" conversation.",

      "The Israelis had the opportunity to assassinate Khamenei and Mr. Trump conveyed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that it wasn't a good idea, one U.S. official told CBS News.

    "summary": "Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot Saturday, while State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded.",
    "story": [
      "Authorities are investigating after targeted shootings left one Minnesota lawmaker dead and another injured. Gov. Tim Walz called the shootings \"politically motivated\" in a news briefing\u00a0on Saturday.",
      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, John, were fatally shot at their home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, Walz said. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded at their home in Champlin, a suburb of Minneapolis. Investigators said the shooter was dressed as a police officer.",
      "A suspect sought by investigators in connection with the Minnesota shootings was identified as\u00a057-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, authorities said. Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally. Authorities found his car on Sunday,\u00a0CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",
      "Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home after learning about the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police chief Mark Bruley said. Hortman's home is about five miles from Hoffman's.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers went to Hortman's home, and saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the individual, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he was pronounced dead. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" A search of the individual's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers reference the anti-Trump protests that are planned in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, statewide \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Earlier in the day, the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",
      "Extensive manhunt for suspect Vance L. Boelter",
      "Investigators have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter\u00a0as the suspect in the shootings. He was last seen Saturday morning wearing a cowboy hat at a business in Minneapolis and he changed his clothes, authorities said at a news conference. Investigators said that they believe Boelter is attempting to flee the Twin Cities area.",
      "According to an emergency alert sent on Sunday to residents of Sibley County, where Boelter's rural home is located, authorities found a vehicle belonging to the suspect in Faxon Township, which is roughly 20 miles away, CBS Minnesota reported. Although Boelter's known address is that home in the Sibley County town of Green Isle, a law enforcement source told CBS Minnesota that the suspect had most recently been living at a home in north Minneapolis.",
      "The emergency alert urged county residents to lock their doors, secure their vehicles and prepare for law enforcement to ask to search properties in the area.",
      "Authorities described Boelter as a White man with brown hair. He was wearing a blue shirt, blue pants and a black tactical vest at at time of the shootings,\u00a0CBS Minnesota reported. Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask.",
      "At the news conference Saturday, investigators confirmed that Boelter is employed at a security firm. He is\u00a0listed\u00a0as director of security patrols on the website of Praetorian Guard Security Services, where his wife is named president and CEO. In a\u00a0profile\u00a0on the website of Minnesota Africans United, which is no longer active, he is also described as the company's CEO.",
      "In a\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0post last month, Boelter said he was \"looking to get back into the U.S. Food Industry\" after spending three years on projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo with a company where he has been listed as chief executive since 2021. In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",
      "Minnesota officials urged the public to reach out with any tips and said Boelter should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to call the tipline at 877-996-6222 or email\u00a0bca.tips@state.mn.us.",
      "Sources said there was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in a vehicle believed to be Boelter's that was discovered outside Hortman's home \u2014 more than 50 individuals, some of them officials beyond Minnesota, including abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "Minnesota police agencies and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are leading the investigation, with assistance from federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. U.S. Marshals have also joined the manhunt, CBS News learned.",
      "Several people have been detained and questioned, Bruley said, and police have identified \"people of interest,\" but a suspect is not in custody.",
      "A shelter-in-place order issued for Brooklyn Park in a three-mile radius around the suburb's Edinburgh Golf Course was later lifted Saturday afternoon because there's \"reason to believe suspect is no longer in the area,\" an emergency alert read.",
      "Increased security has been ordered for elected officials and others who may be at risk, he said.",
      "Suspect served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman",
      "Boelter served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman, records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "Boelter was first appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board in 2016 by then-Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton as a private-sector representative, with a term lasting through 2019, according to state records. Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",
      "Records show that Hoffman served on the 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. Of the board's members,\u00a041 are appointed by the governor, while legislative leaders name two state senators and two representatives.",
      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn on the day of the 2018 midterm elections, Boelter\u00a0posted about the importance of voting in elections.",
      "\"I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Who was Rep. Melissa Hortman?",
      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004. She and her husband, John, have two children, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Until Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",
      "He served as chair of the Human Services Committee, and also served on committees for energy, environment and health and human services, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "He and his wife Yvette were each shot multiple times, Walz said. They are out of surgery and are receiving care, Walz said. He added that his \"prayers are with\" the couple.",
      "The Hoffmans have one daughter, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",
      "Walz also thanked the responding officers, who he said showed \"bravery and swift action.\"",
      "\"We will spare no resource in bringing those responsible to justice. We will not let fear win,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"terrible shooting\" and said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation and would prosecute anyone involved \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Rep. Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, responded to the shootings in a joint statement issued alongside all members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation.",
      "\"Today we speak with one voice to express our outrage, grief, and condemnation of this horrible attack on public servants,\" the statement said. \"There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated violence. We are praying for John and Yvette's recovery and we grieve the loss of Melissa and Mark with their family, colleagues, and Minnesotans across the state. We are grateful for law enforcement's swift response to the situation and continued efforts.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he has asked Capitol Police to increase security for both Minnesota senators, Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Schumer also said he has asked Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to convene a full briefing as soon as senators return to Washington.",
      "\"As we continue to follow this terrifying situation, I urge everyone to stay safe, stay vigilant, and reject political violence in all its forms,\" Schumer said. \"But condemning violence while ignoring what fuels it is not enough. We must confront the toxic forces radicalizing individuals and we must do more to protect one another, our democracy, and the values that bind us as Americans.\"",
      "Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, in an assassination attempt by a lone gunman that killed six people and wounded 12 others, said in a statement Saturday that she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the shootings.",
      "\"My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well,\" said Giffords, who is married to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"",

      "And in the escalating war between Israel and Iran, can the U.S. avoid further involvement?",
      "A massive manhunt is underway after a gunman authorities say posed as a police officer shot two Minnesota lawmakers, killing one and injuring another, leaving behind a list of other lawmakers to target. We will have the latest.",
      "Los Angeles is still the epicenter of protest and unrest following the White House mandate to ramp up deportations of people in the country illegally. Will the president's softening of that order ease the situation?",
      "We will talk with California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He was briefly detained himself following an attempt to interrupt Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference in Los Angeles last week.",
      "As the back-and-forth between Israel and Iran picks up in its intensity, with no end in sight, is there any way to de-escalate tensions in the Mideast before the situation worsens? The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton, will be here.",
      "Then, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal will appear together to talk about their bipartisan effort to punish Russia with sanctions, as that country continues their bombardment of Ukraine.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "The streets of Washington are quiet following yesterday's parade celebrating the Army's 250th birthday, just one of many milestones we will be honoring as we get closer to marking America's own 250th next year. President Trump celebrated his 79th birthday with a rousing appreciation of our armed forces, although the event itself was somewhat subdued, amid criticism of increased politicization of the military.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): No matter the risk, no matter the obstacles, our warriors will charge into battle, they will plunge into the crucible of fire, and they will seize the crown of victory.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The obstacles this country faces today continue to grow, particularly those exacerbated by the widening divide among Americans.",
      "As the Army was marching down Constitution Avenue yesterday, dozens of organized protests of the president and his policies as part of the No King movement were held across the country.",
      "We will have more on those protests later in the broadcast, but we begin today with a shocking act of political violence that is still unfolding just outside of Minneapolis.",
      "CBS News correspondent Lilia Luciano has the latest from Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "LILIA LUCIANO (voice-over): The manhunt in Minneapolis entered its second day. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, accused in what Governor Tim Walz called a politically motivated assassination of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, Saturday morning.",
      "GOVERNOR TIM WALZ (D-Minnesota): This was an act of targeted political violence.",
      "LILIA LUCIANO: Hours earlier, State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times at their home in nearby Champlin. The two are recovering in a hospital.",
      "Boelter is listed as the director of a private security company. Records show he served on a state board with Senator Hoffman. This image from the state senator's home security camera appears to show the suspect wearing a full face mask, what looks like a police uniform, and tactical vest. This happened at around 2:00 a.m.",
      "Around 2.5 hours later, during a precautionary safety check at Representative Hortman's home, officers spotted the suspect walking out the front door. He opened fire and then ran away. Police say he left behind a car equipped with flashing white and yellow lights and a police license plate.",
      "Inside were leaflets reading \"No Kings,\" a manifesto listing more than 50 possible targets, including abortion clinics, pro-abortion rights advocates, and other lawmakers from states beyond Minnesota.",
      "(End VT)",
      "LILIA LUCIANO: A man who shared a home with a suspect told reporters that he's a Christian, that he does not like abortion, but that he didn't seem really angry about politics, at least not lately.",
      "He also shared a text message he says the suspect sent him on Saturday morning, which read: \"I'm going to be gone for a while, and I may be dead shortly\" \u2013 Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lilia Luciano in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, thank you.",
      "And we turn now with what began Thursday as an Israeli attack on Iran in order to debilitate Iran's nuclear program. And the back-and-forth between the two countries continues to intensify, threatening an already unstable region.",
      "Our Debora Patta is in Tel Aviv with the latest.",
      "DEBORA PATTA: The conflict between Israel and Iran is in uncharted territory, as the escalating tensions enter their fourth day, with the two rivals each warning, there is worse to come.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DEBORA PATTA (voice-over): Overnight, wave after wave of Iranian drones bearing down on Tel Aviv. Most were intercepted. Those that got through destroyed homes and shops.",
      "Israel was quick to retaliate, targeting an oil refinery and hitting buildings in Tehran. There have been casualties on both sides. At least 12 Israelis were killed this weekend, but that toll was dwarfed by the damage Israel inflicted on Iran, with almost 100 civilian deaths, nearly 30 of them children, and the assassination of top military commanders and scientists.",
      "The surprise Israeli strikes began on Thursday. Israel wants to cripple Iran's nuclear capability, already hitting four major facilities, Natanz, Tabriz, Isfahan, and Fordow, as well as key energy sites. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not done yet.",
      "(PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)",
      "DEBORA PATTA: \"What they have felt so far,\" he said, \"is nothing compared to what's coming.\"",
      "(SIRENS BLARING)",
      "DEBORA PATTA: But Iran has warned of a far more ferocious response if Israel does not back down.",
      "Another casualty, nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington scheduled for today. Those have been postponed indefinitely.",
      "Zohar Palti is the former director of Mossad intelligence.",
      "So, are Israel and Iran at war?",
      "ZOHAR PALTI (Former Mossad Intelligence Director): Yes.",
      "DEBORA PATTA: Unequivocally?",
      "ZOHAR PALTI: Definitely.",
      "DEBORA PATTA: But starting a war is one thing; ending it is a lot harder.",
      "ZOHAR PALTI: No doubt that, without the Americans, without President Trump, nothing will be over, over here. And when the American will decide, enough is enough, whether with us or whether with the Iranians or with or without, they have the ability to end it.",
      "(End VT)",
      "DEBORA PATTA: Not only is Netanyahu striking Iran. He is also appealing to the hearts and minds of Iranians, hinting at regime change and urging them to stand up for their freedom.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's our Debora Patta in Tel Aviv.",
      "Thank you.",
      "And the conflict between Israel and Iran has undermined President Trump's efforts to negotiate directly with Iran on a nuclear deal. Overnight, he vowed in a social media post that, if the U.S. was attacked in any way by Iran, that the \u2013 quote \u2013 \"full strength and might of U.S. armed forces would come down at levels never seen before,\" and then seemingly offered to negotiate a deal between Iran and Israel.",
      "We go now to Holly Williams, who is at Iran's border with Iraq.",
      "HOLLY WILLIAMS: Here in the Middle East, Iran has accused the U.S. of being complicit in Israel's attack and has threatened to target American military bases and ships if the U.S. blocks Iranian strikes on Israel.",
      "But the U.S. has already done that with air defense systems and a warship, according to a U.S. military official. There are around 40,000 American troops in the Middle East, a powerful presence that aims to protect U.S. interests, including trade routes.",
      "But if Iran did try to strike American forces, the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops here in Iraq could be the most obvious target, since they're right next door. Iran previously targeted U.S. forces in Iraq with ballistic missiles back in 2020 in retaliation for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force.",
      "No U.S. service members were killed on that occasion. Since then, a series of shifts has reshaped the Middle East and weakened Iran and its proxies, the war in Gaza, Israel's decimation of the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the collapse of the Syrian regime, and now Israel's surprise attack.",
      "If Iran does target American forces this time, it would be extremely risky, because it will likely draw a sharp response from the U.S., when Iran is already under attack.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Holly Williams reporting from the Iraq-Iran border.",
      "And we're joined now in Washington by Senator Tom Cotton, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.",
      "Good morning, and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you are staying on top of all these events.",
      "When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is not America's fight unless Iran hits the U.S.",
      "Should it be such a bright line?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, what the president said in his overnight post was a clear message to the ayatollahs, that, if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.",
      "That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program poses to Israel and to the United States, because, let's remember, the Iranian regime has been terrorizing Americans. It's killed thousands of Americans. It's taken them hostage. It still chants \"Death to America.\" And it's building missiles that can strike not just our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well.",
      "And that's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life that we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months.",
      "But, as he said early last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. And I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. It was Iran's \u2013 Iran's stubbornness that ended them.",
      "President Trump was clear about that. And he is still clear that there is time, if they want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would accept that. But he's given them chance after chance, as he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in terms of the line he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military operations?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I don't think he's drawn that line. He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to support Israel\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He hasn't said that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But he \u2013 well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment.",
      "He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death, or there will be bombing. So, I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that we back Israel to the hilt. There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time. So, of course, we're going to protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world.",
      "And he said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term and in this term as well. So, we back Israel to the hilt all the way. But he's appropriately keeping all options on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us. This isn't America. This isn't an American operation.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: So, so far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over the years or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel.",
      "Now, he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament. And he has said that that can happen still through a deal. I don't think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He prefers diplomacy.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And he would like Iran to come back to the table, I think, now that Iran sees that Israel and America mean business\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. If that doesn't happen, though, I think these strikes are going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain.",
      "It's long been assessed that only the U.S. has the capability with a bunker-buster bomb to take it out. Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordnance penetrator to Israel to finish the job?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might use\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should they?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 to protect our own interests.",
      "I will simply say this. It is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. It doesn't have those 30,000-pound penetrating munitions. But, as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night, when the Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has more than a few tricks up their sleeve.",
      "And I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the U.S. intelligence that was made public in March said at the time the U.S. does not assess Iran's building a nuclear weapon and that the supreme leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended back in 2003.",
      "Was there more recent U.S. intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind of sprint for a bomb?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of the uranium to near weapons-grade over the four years of the Biden administration. And they\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not weaponization. You know that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: They are \u2013 they are close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons.",
      "Now, that's not the only step to having a weapon. You also have to have the weapon design. We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. And then, if you want to use a missile, obviously, you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. But Iran has other delivery methods as well, through terrorist proxies.",
      "So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu thought we \u2013 things that were coming to a head. A second reason is, Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium-range to target Israel and short-range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month.",
      "And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but why Thursday night?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There seems to be a difference in this idea of a sprint.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President Trump \u2013 well, as President Trump said on Friday morning, that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal.",
      "That was day 61.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And he scheduled talks on day 63. You know that.",
      "I mean, this was a \u2013 this wasn't really a hard deadline.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: He gave them 60 days. On day 61, the strikes began.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Day 63, Steve Witkoff wanted to meet with them.",
      "But if this was a covert race to weaponize, though, it \u2013 it raises questions here, because it appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place in Iran.",
      "Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? Do you support his push for diplomacy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 which means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well in Iran not having a nuclear weapon.",
      "We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. We've seen their campaign of terror against Americans over the decades. That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And presidents have said \u2013 for 20 years, presidents have said that. George Bush said it, didn't act on it. Barack Obama and Joe Biden, frankly, aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not enforcing that line. It is Israel that's bombing. As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But, in \u2013 in Israel, we are helping \u2013 we're help\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 but do you share the president's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Iranian people to rise up against?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. They are today what they were Thursday morning, before these strikes started. As the president has said repeatedly, they can make a deal, or there's going to be bombing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to some domestic issues, but, very quickly, I know in the past, you have said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue to receive security. President Trump pulled it.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get it now?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We should probably revisit the threat that all persons face \u2013 remember, President Trump faced assassination threats from Iran as well \u2013 in this moment of tension, to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that security detail was pulled by the president himself.",
      "On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. Do you support this decision?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement.",
      "I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal migrant working. Usually, it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working in their worksites. And whatever worksite it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president has pulled back from that. That was the change in policy last week when it came to farms, in particular.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I don't \u2013 I don't think we should \u2013 I don't think we should pull back to any \u2013 on any kind of enforcement at all.",
      "I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, where it could impact the economy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we should \u2013 we should not \u2013 we should not declare any industry or any worksite that uses large numbers of illegal immigrants off-limits for enforcement of federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about the enforcement to date.",
      "As you know, there has been outcry. We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to California.",
      "You referred to it as \"the threat from the radical left, an overwhelming show of force to end the riots,\" and talked about communities being terrorized.",
      "Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, when you see left-wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles at police officers and shooting them with fireworks.",
      "And, unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to maintain order. The next step is to call in the National Guard. And if the governor won't call on the National Guard, then the president has to federalize them.",
      "We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. But, if they can't, or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent yesterday. They fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: The L.A. police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed, and they couldn't manage the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by two senators in a rare bipartisan interview, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. They're co-sponsors on legislation to put secondary sanctions on Russia.",
      "Good morning to you both.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina): Good morning.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to that conflict in a moment, but starting here on the Middle East, Senator Graham, you said you believe it's in America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job.",
      "It sounds like you mean offensive support.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy \u2013 I prefer that \u2013 or through military action.",
      "If diplomacy is not successful, and we are left with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that, when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs. If that means flying\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bunker-busting bombs?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Whatever bombs.",
      "If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the U.S. get?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy, as well as the world.",
      "A nuclear-armed Iran is a unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel, but to the United States as well. And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace.",
      "I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our service men and women, but also the civilians that are there. I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut who are deeply worried about their children who are there, about the hostage families.",
      "I support the president's effort to prioritize diplomacy.",

      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We need to move assets. And we've done so. Not only to protect U.S. personnel, but also to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation.",
      "But I think that the president is right to try to bring the two sides together. There is a deal that's possible here if Iran were to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel but the entire regional stability, because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if Iran does as well. But Americans have no interest in a forever war. And so I think we need to be mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together, as well as protecting U.S. personnel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator Graham, the \u2013 the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli prime minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A regime he says is calling for the destruction of his state.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there if it's truly this existential. Is this just leading us towards the outcome you say, which is the United States getting involved in military conflict?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, this \u2013 I would love for the regime to fall. If you don't, if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people to oppress the Iranian people. You want people to threaten their neighbors, to \u2013 to be the largest state \u2013 who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? But regime change is not the policy of the United States. It is not the purpose of this attack yet. But if there is one attack on an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change.",
      "So, what are we dealing with? We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. They can't have a nuclear program that can make a bomb. Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. And I said as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President, President Trump, you've been great, help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs. Fly with them if necessary.",
      "I cannot stress to you how \u2013 if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better, you want to convince international terrorism we mean business, you've got to finish the job with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's any willingness to negotiate. So far, we haven't seen much.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, that's a big mistake on Iran's part. It's not on President Trump's. If we don't have notions, it's not because of Trump, it's because of the ayatollah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or \u2013 you can't necessarily bomb someone into concessions that they were not willing to make, right? I mean here \u2013 is there \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I don't think they have any desire to make concessions.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: If \u2013 if Iran miscalculates now \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It will face the consequences. But there is a road to a deal. President Obama reached a deal. Far from perfect. President Trump ripped it up. If it were in effect, maybe we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. They're close to ten bombs now. But there is the possibility of diplomacy. In the meantime, the United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to clarify, when you say close to ten bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel? But as far as we know, from the U.S. assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn that into a weapon. We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when I asked that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What purpose do you need \u2013 if I may, what purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60 percent other than making a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leverage (ph).",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why do you have 900 pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, the \u2013 the assessment was they wanted the leverage, right? So \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, right, whatever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By the way \u2013",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Finally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran and \u2013 Iran and Russia \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. And we're bipartisan on this. We say the same, actually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 you are. Iran and Russia work together.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: And, you know, if I can just add one more point about Iran \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran, which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of exerting pressure. I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham and I \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I will be your wingman. We'll write the bill right here on television. China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian oil and stop helping the Iranians. You would make the world a safer place if you would stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They buy it because it's cheap, though. And they \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, they \u2013 well, you know \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that \u2013 but right now \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well then, they should play a price for propping up Putin's war machine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We should crush their economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So, tell me about that. So, with the \u2013 the sanctions bill that you all are working on, you have a veto-proof majority.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just need the Senate leader to put it to a floor and you need the president to tell him go. What are you waiting for?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think the president should call on the Senate to vote approval of the Russian sanction bill literally tomorrow. He's on his way tonight to the G-7 meeting. He will be sitting across from world leaders. Right now, very bluntly, the perception may be one of weakness in terms of America's position on Ukraine. He can be there in a position of strength. This bill will pass overwhelmingly. It has 84 evenly divided co- sponsored. It will get 90 votes on the floor of the Senate.",
      "This moment cries out for presidential leadership. There is an urgency here. We've seen the neighborhoods decimated, people killed in their sleep, women and children shot in the back of their heads and buried in mass graves in Bukha. Children who are kidnapped and re-educated, 20,000 of them, behind Russian lines. These atrocities are ongoing. And the people of Ukraine are bleeding and dying.",
      "So, I am hoping that the president will affirmatively show leadership here and call on the Senate to vote. The majority leader could do it tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We have some technical issues to work out. But I really think the moment has come for President Trump to call on the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, President Trump tweeted yesterday that he did speak to Vladimir Putin, who called very nicely to wish me a happy birthday and talk about Iran.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said they're going to speak again this week.",
      "President Trump has put sanctions on Iran while talking to Iran. Why won't he put sanctions on Russia while talking to Russia?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We have sanctions on Russia. He \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not new Trump sanctions. You know that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Just \u2013 so, I find it odd. So, my Democratic friends are holding him back when it comes to Iran. We appreciate you trying to do diplomacy. What am I saying? Do diplomacy with Iran until it doesn't work. What am I saying with Russia? I don't mind you \u2013 I don't care if you go on vacation with Putin. I don't care how it ends. I want the war to end so we don't start new wars. I want our \u2013 Ukraine surviving when the war ends. I want Putin not to be overly rewarded for the invasion.",
      "To China, if you stop buying Russian oil, cheap, and India, the war machine would grind to a halt. President Trump has tried diplomacy. And I will say this, I talked to him last night, you've made very sincere efforts to get Putin to the table. I think he's playing a game with you and the entire world. It is now time to change the game with Putin.",
      "I talked to President Trump last night. Stay tuned. If we do not have a breakthrough soon, I would expect that these sanctions will move through the Senate and the House. And to China, if you want your economy ruined, keep buying Russian cheap oil. If you want to be a new nation in the eyes of the civilized world, change your behavior regarding Putin and the ayatollah. And until you change your behavior \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You're going to be seen as a problem, not a solution.",
      "So, these sanctions are coming if Putin doesn't change. And to my good friend Dick, you've been a great ally. If we can't get the ayatollah back to the table, it is now time to end his nuclear program using military force, jointly with Israel if we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If we get Iran wrong, good luck with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, the bill that you put forward will put a 500 percent tariff, as I understand it, on imported goods from countries that buy Russia's oil, their uranium, their gas, other products. It would hit China. It would hit India. The U.S. is also trying to negotiate trade deals with them. Is that getting in the way?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think there is really no obstacle to our moving ahead with these bone-crushing sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if oil prices spike because of what's happening in the Middle East?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: You know, we are now energy independent when it comes to oil, the United States. Europe has weaned itself off Russian oil. We visited with President Macron, we've talked to Chancellor Merz. Europe is solidly behind these sanctions. And we've incorporated flexibility in this bill based on our national security for a potential waiver where our interests are concerned, unforeseeable or unknowably right now. We've incorporated exceptions for our European allies who are aiding Ukraine in the billions of dollars, giving them a little bit more time to adjust.",
      "This is a carefully constructed bill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They get 20 percent of their gas from Russia, right?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Can \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What he says, that there's three categories. If you're not doing business with Russia, you don't have anything to worry about. If you're doing business with Russia but you're helping Ukraine, you have a carveout for 270 days. If you're doing business with Russia and not helping Ukraine, you're screwed. The president can waive part or all of this based on our national interest. But to the people who wonder, should we pay a price for our freedom? We have in the past.",
      "Go to Arlington. Oil prices will go up if we confront Russia through our bill. Oil prices will go up if we try to confront Iran for their nuclear ambitions. But you pay now or you pay later.",
      "If we get Iran right and we get peace with Russia/Ukraine, not only do oil prices come down, the world will be better off. So, this idea of having freedom and not sacrificing never existed, nor does it exist now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to ask you as well about what's happening here at home with the protests we have seen around the country and some of them at times turning violent. There has been criticism of Democrats' policies on immigration. Do you think that this confrontation that we are seeing now, between military forces, federalized, and protesters is partly because of what Democrats have done to date?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The use of military, whether it's the National Guard or the Marines, can be inflammatory and provocative. We had protests across the country yesterday that were entirely peaceful. I was at a number of them in Connecticut, in Hartford and Farmington and elsewhere, all around the country. I think this country knows how to do peaceful protest. And the exceptions ought to be handled by the local police and prosecutors locally.",
      "I spent most of my life in law enforcement before I had this job. I was the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut. Then I was attorney general for 20 years. And the reliance on state and local police I think is well-founded. And I've supported \u2013 in fact, I've introduced a bill that would limit use of the Insurrection Act, would define better what is a rebellion, and compel the president to come back to Congress for approval if he uses this kind of federal force.",
      "So, I think that there are criticisms to be made of immigration policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: In fact, I favor comprehensive immigration reform. We need it. But that is separate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would call on local law enforcement to perhaps stand up more and deal with it at the local level?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It's the local level where law enforcement happens in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We rely on state and local police. And that ought to be the way we enforce our laws in this country. And emphasize the importance of peaceful protests, such as we saw yesterday around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "All right, Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview. Rare, as we said.",
      "We'll be back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Saturday, demonstrators participating in the \"no kings\" movement marched in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., as part of an organized effort to protest President Trump's policies, including recent deportation sweeps. Organizers of the \"no kings\" rally said that over 5 million people participated coast to coast.",
      "Most were peaceful. But in Salt Lake City, at least one person was injured in a shooting during a demonstration. And in Portland, Oregon, local police declared a riot outside an I.C.E. facility for a few hours before that crowd dispersed.",
      "And we're joined now by California Senator Alex Padilla.",
      "Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Thank you. Thank you. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there and including those who are living a little bit fearful right now because of what we're seeing, these increasingly cruel and extreme immigration enforcement raids. But, nonetheless, they're going to work, trying to provide for their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your personal experience with some of this. As many of our viewers saw that video of you being briefly detained when you were trying to get a question to the Homeland Security secretary. Their office \u2013 her office later said you spoke for nearly 15 minutes afterwards. Did you get the answer to the question you were trying to ask? And \u2013 and what was it?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, sadly, no. And to a little bit of context here. The reason I tried to \u2013 the reason I was at the press conference, I was \u2013 I was at a scheduled briefing with representatives at Northern Command, just a couple doors down the hall, in the same federal building, when I learned of the press conference. My briefing delayed because the folks I was supposed to meet with were at that press conference.",
      "So, I asked if we could listen in. I was escorted over. And that's what I was doing.",
      "Why? Because for months and months, whether it's in committee, the secretary herself testifying and not providing substantive answers to questions, other representatives of the department, formal letters and inquiries that we've submitted, doing my job as a senator, to get information as part of our oversight and accountability responsibility.",
      "So, to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly, when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it but, sadly, no, nothing substantive, nothing informative.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She couldn't answer the question or \u2013",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Either couldn't or wouldn't. And \u2013 and, frankly, that says a lot, right, in terms of the type of \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What was the question?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, among other things, their justification for the \u2013 the federalization of the National Guard, not only not necessary but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles. And also just truth. You know, for all the talk about the focus and targeting of violent criminals, if that's all the Trump administration was doing, there would be no debate. There's no disagreement on that.",
      "But as you're hearing more and more stories of undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families. And, frankly, working in jobs that under the first Trump administration, when the Covid pandemic hit, were deemed essential, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Workers in restaurants, in agricultural fields, in health care, construction, et cetera, that's who's being targeted now, and that's why there's so much fear and \u2013 and terror in communities, not just in Los Angeles but throughout the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the vast majority of immigrants in California, we went and we looked at the stats. They are in this country legally. But Pew Research says your state has nearly two million undocumented and they make up about 7 percent of the entire labor force in some of those farming and service jobs that you \u2013 you talked about.",
      "Since the Trump administration this week told I.C.E. to pull back a bit when it comes to enforcement, do you see that as a step in the right direction, and do you know what triggered that decision?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, so I don't know exactly what triggered that decision. I'll take it. Is it a step in the right direction? It's at least a baby step. And let's hope there's more to follow because they're responding to what I and others have been saying for months and what's frankly years, going back to the first Trump administration. You know, you \u2013 you \u2013 you want stats? Let's talk about stats. The \u2013 the state of California, the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, mostly documented, some undocumented. This is the same California that is the largest economy of any state in the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Fourth-largest economy in the world. Not despite the immigrant population, but thanks to the contributions of so many immigrants as a workforce, as consumers and as \u2013 as entrepreneurs. So, again, focus on the dangerous, violent criminals. No disagreement there. But the \u2013 the folks who are otherwise law-abiding, tax-paying and \u2013 and enriching communities, there's got to be a better way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: A pathway towards legalization. A pathway to citizenship for dreamers, farm workers and others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's \u2013 that is hoping for \u2013 for movement in Congress that would take some time.",
      "I did note it was interesting to see the \u2013 in the House, the Republican Hispanic conference put forth a letter asking for a breakdown of how many criminals were among those actually deported.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And that was \u2013 yes, that was \u2013 and that was one of the key questions I had for the secretary. Of course, she had no data, had no answer, promised to follow up, I hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: We'll see. And \u2013 and I also want to be clear about this, because when I had the audacity to try to ask a question, as a Senator of a cabinet secretary, that's what happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And you saw the response. Everybody's seen the video. You know, it wasn't about me. But if that's how this administration responds to a senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of but what they are doing when the cameras are not there to people without a title like United States senator. That cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling \u2013 on the policy front, we see in our polling that there still is broad support for President Trump's mass deportation policy. Our last CBS poll, as of last Sunday, showed 54 percent approval. There was an interesting \"Washington Post\" piece written by David Ignatius that was pretty sharp about Democrats, saying that, \"they've gotten the border issue so wrong for so long, it's political malpractice.\" And that he was basically arguing, Democrats are handing to Trump the confrontation he wanted with the military, citing actions during the first administration.",
      "Do you think that he has a point there?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: No, I think, you know, \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the public approval is so high of deportation.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well \u2013 but details matter. It depends. You know, it depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the same people, you know, do they think we should maintain due process in the United States of America, the answer is overwhelming, yes. Do dreamers deserve better than the limbo that they find themselves in? Overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, yes.",
      "And so, I think it's important to break down three things. Number one, do we need a safe and secure, ordinarily, humane border? Absolutely. No disagreement there. People seeking to come to the United States, whether it's to seek asylum, on work visas, et cetera, we definitely have to modernize that system and be more strategic in those capacities. But we can't forget the millions of long-term residents, people who have been here working, paying taxes, raising families, buying homes, contributing to the strength of our economy, they deserve better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are the ranking member on the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees the Capitol Police. What, if anything, can you tell us about the state of security for lawmakers given what's happening in Minnesota?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, look, a lot of questions, a lot of concerns. I work directly with both the U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms. And they're doing what they need to do to ensure the \u2013 the safety of members of \u2013 of Congress. But I also think it's more than appropriate to step back and say, why are tensions so high, not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country? And I can't help but point to the beginning of, not just the first Trump term, but the \u2013 the beginning of the campaign. The tone with which the president launched his first campaign for president, served throughout his first term and continues in this term. For a cabinet secretary, during a press conference, to not be able or be willing to deescalate a situation when I was trying to ask a question, that's just indicative of the tone of the administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wanted her to say, wait a second, I \u2013 I know who he is, calm down, let him go? Is that what you're saying?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: The \u2013 the vast majority of people in that room knew who I was. I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard's member. It's the Los Angeles Press Corp. It said, United States Senate on the chest of my polo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Padilla, thank you for joining us today.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. And we want to wish all the fathers out there a Happy Father's Day. And I want to say Happy Father's Day to my own father, my father-in-law and, of course, my husband.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 15, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by two senators in a rare, bipartisan interview: Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. They're co-sponsors on legislation to put secondary sanctions on Russia. Good morning to you both.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to that conflict in a moment, but starting here on the Middle East, Senator Graham, you said you believe it's \"in America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job.\" It sounds like you mean offensive support.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: So, the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy, I prefer that, or through military action. If diplomacy is not successful, and we left with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs. If that means flying --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bunker-busting bombs?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Whatever bombs. If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the US get?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy as well as the world. A nuclear-armed Iran is a unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel, but to the United States as well. And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace. I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our servicemen and women, but also the civilians that are there. I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut who are deeply worried about their children who were there, about the hostage families. I support the President's effort to prioritize diplomacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk more about this after the commercial break. So please stay here with us, and we'll be right back.",
      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And welcome back to Face the Nation. We return now to our conversation with Senators Graham and Blumenthal. Senator Blumenthal, before we get to Ukraine, I just want to tie up the Middle East here. You know, the defense secretary was testifying to Congress this week, and he said he's moved equipment meant to counter drones in Ukraine over to the Middle East now, because of this escalation. What more is needed to protect U.S. personnel?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: We need to move assets, and we've done so. Not only to protect U.S. personnel, but also to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation. But I think that the President is right to try to bring the two sides together. There is a deal that's possible here, if Iran were to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel, but the entire regional stability, because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if Iran does as well. But Americans have no interest in a Forever War. And so, I think we need to be mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together as well as protecting U.S. personnel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli Prime Minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime, a regime he says is calling for the destruction of his state. It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there if it's truly this existential. Is this just leading us towards the outcome, you say, which is the United States getting involved in military conflict?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I would love for the regime to fall. If you don't- if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people to oppress the Iranian people. You want people to threaten their neighbors, to- to be the largest states- who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? But, regime change is not the policy of the United States. It is not the purpose of this attack, yet. But if there is one attack on an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change. So, what are we dealing with? We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. They can't have a nuclear program that can make a bomb. Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. And I've said as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President- President Trump, you've been great, help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs, fly with them if necessary. I cannot stress to you how, if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better. You want to convince international terrorism we mean business, you've got to finish the job with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's any willingness to negotiate. So far, we haven't seen much.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: That's a big mistake on Iran's part. It's not on President Trump's- if we don't have negotiations, it's not because of Trump. It's because of the Ayatollah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or- I mean, you can't necessarily bomb someone into concessions that they were not willing to make, right?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I don't think they had any desire to make concessions.",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: If Iran miscalculates now, it will face the consequences. But there is a road to a deal. President Obama reached a deal. Far from perfect. President Trump ripped it up. If it were in effect, maybe, we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. They're close to 10 bombs now. But, there is the possibility of diplomacy. In the meantime, the United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to clarify, when you say close to 10 bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel. But, as far as we know, from the US assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn that into a weapon. We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when I asked that.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: What purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60% other than making a weapon? Why do you have 900 pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the- the assessment was, they wanted the leverage, right?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, right. Whatever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can. By the way \u2013",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Finally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Iran and Russia --",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: --We're bipartisan on this.",
      "((CROSSTALK))",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: And, you know, if I could just add one more point about Iran?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions, I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran. Which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of exerting pressure. I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham will --",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'll be your wingman. We'll write the bill right here on television. China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian oil, and stop helping the Iranians. You make the world a safer place if you would stop",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They buy it because it's cheap, though. Yeah, they --",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: They should pay a price for propping up Putin's war machine. We should crush their economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so tell me about that. So, with the sanctions bill that you all are working on, you have a veto-proof majority. You just need the Senate leader to put it to a floor vote, and you need the President to tell him \"go\". What are you waiting for?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: I think the president should call on the Senate to vote approval of the Russian sanctions bill literally tomorrow. He's on his way tonight to the G7 meeting. He will be sitting across from world leaders. Right now, very bluntly, the perception may be one of weakness in terms of America's position on Ukraine. He can be there in a position of strength. This bill will pass overwhelmingly. Has 84 evenly divided co-sponsors. It will get 90 votes on the floor of the Senate. This moment cries out for presidential leadership. There is an urgency here. We've seen the neighborhoods decimated, people killed in their sleep, women and children shot in the back of their heads and buried in mass graves in Bucha, children who are kidnapped and re-educated, 20,000 of them, behind Russian lines. These atrocities are ongoing, and the people of Ukraine are bleeding and dying. So I am hoping that the President will affirmatively show leadership here and call on the Senate to vote. The majority leader could do it tomorrow--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah.",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: We have some technical issues to work out, but I really think the moment has come for President Trump to call on the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, President Trump tweeted yesterday that he did speak to Vladimir Putin who called very nicely to wish me a happy birthday and talk about Iran. He said they're going to speak again this week. President Trump has put sanctions on Iran while talking to Iran. Why won't he put sanctions on Russia while talking to Russia?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: We have sanctions on Russia. He provided--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Not new Trump sanctions. You know that.--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: --Just. So I find it odd. So my Democratic friends are holding him back when it comes to Iran. We really appreciate you trying to do diplomacy. What am I saying? Do diplomacy with Iran until it doesn't work. What am I saying with Russia? I don't mind you, I don't care if you go on vacation with Putin. I don't care how it ends, I want the war to end so we don't start new wars. I want Ukraine surviving when the war ends. I want Putin not to be overly rewarded for the invasion. To China, if you stop buying Russian oil cheap and India, the war machine would grind to a halt. President Trump has tried diplomacy. And I will say this, I talked to him last night, you've made very sincere efforts to get Putin to the table. I think he's playing a game with you and the entire world. It is now time to change the game with Putin. I talked to President Trump last night. Stay tuned. If we do not have a breakthrough soon, I would expect that these sanctions will move through the Senate and the House. And to China, if you want your economy ruined, keep buying Russian cheap oil. If you want to be a new nation in the eyes of the civilized world, change your behavior regarding Putin and the Ayatollah. Until you change your behavior, you're going to be seen as a problem, not a solution. So these sanctions are coming if Putin doesn't change. And to my good friend, Dick, you've been a great ally. If we can't get the Ayatollah back to the table, it is now time to end his nuclear program using military force jointly with Israel if we have to. If we get Iran wrong, good luck with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, the bill that you put forward will put a 500% tariff, as I understand it, on imported goods from countries that buy Russia's oil, their uranium, their gas, other products. It'd hit China, it'd hit India. U.S. is also trying to negotiate trade deals with them. Is that getting in the way?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: I think there is really no obstacle to our moving ahead with these bone crushing sanctions--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Even if oil prices spike because of what's happening in the Middle East?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: You know we are now energy independent when it comes to oil, the United States. Europe has weaned itself off Russian oil. We visited with President Macron. We've talked to Chancellor Mertz. Europe is solidly behind these sanctions, and we've incorporated flexibility in this bill, based on our national security, for a potential waiver where our interests are concerned unforeseeably or unknowably right now. We've incorporated exemptions for our European allies who are aiding Ukraine in the billions of dollars, giving them a little bit more time to adjust. This is a carefully constructed bill--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They get 20% of their gas from Russia.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: What he says, there's three categories. If you're not doing business with Russia, you don't have anything to worry about. If you're doing business with Russia, but you're helping Ukraine you have a carve out for 270 days. If you're doing business with Russia and not helping Ukraine, you're screwed. The president can waive part of all of this based on our national interest, but to the people who wonder should we pay a price for our freedom? We have in the past. Go to Arlington. Oil prices will go up if we confront Russia through our bill. Oil prices will go up if we try to confront Iran for their nuclear ambitions. But you pay now or you pay later. If we get Iran right and we get peace with Russia, Ukraine, not only do oil prices come down, the world will be better off. So this idea of having freedom and not sacrificing never existed nor does it exist now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to ask you as well about what's happening here at home, with the protests we have seen around the country, and some of them, at times, turning violent. There has been criticism of Democrats policies on immigration. Do you think that this confrontation that we are seeing now between military forces, federalized, and protesters is partly because of what Democrats have done to date?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: The use of military, whether it's the National Guard or the Marines, can be inflammatory and provocative. We had protests across the country yesterday that were entirely peaceful. I was at a number of them in Connecticut, in Hartford and Farmington and elsewhere, all around the country. I think this country knows how to do peaceful protest, and the exceptions ought to be handled by the local police and prosecutors locally. I spent most of my life in law enforcement before I had this job. I was the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut, then I was attorney general for 20 years, and the reliance on state and local police, I think, is well founded. And I've supported, in fact, I've introduced a bill that would limit use of the Insurrection Act, would define better what is a rebellion and compel the president to come back to Congress for approval if he uses this kind of federal force. So I think that there are criticisms to be made of immigration policies. In fact, I favor comprehensive immigration reform. We need it, but that is separate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you would call local law enforcement to perhaps stand up more and deal with it at the local level?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: It's the local level where law enforcement happens in this country. We rely on state and local police, and that ought to be the way we enforce our laws in this country and emphasize the importance of peaceful protests, such as we saw yesterday around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview. Rare as we said, we'll be back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 15, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by California Senator Alex Padilla. Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SEN. ALEX PADILLA: Thank you. Thank you. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there, and including those who are probably living a little bit fearful right now because of what we're seeing these increasingly cruel and extreme immigration enforcement raids, but nonetheless, they're going to work trying to provide for their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your personal experience with some of this, as many of our viewers saw that video of you being briefly detained when you were trying to get a question in to the Homeland Security Secretary. There- her office later said you spoke for nearly 15 minutes afterwards. Did you get the answer to the question you were trying to ask? And what was it?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Yes- sadly, no. And so a little bit of context here, the reason I tried to- the reason I was at the press conference, it was at a scheduled briefing with representatives of Northern Command just a couple doors down the hall in the same federal building when I learned of the press conference. My briefing delayed because the folks I was supposed to meet with were at that press conference. So I asked if we could listen in I was escorted over, and that's what I was doing. Why? Because for months and months, whether it's in committee, the Secretary herself testifying and not providing substantive answers to questions, other representatives of the department, formal letters and inquiries that we've submitted, doing my job as a senator to get information as part of our oversight and accountability responsibility. So to be able to ask a question of the Secretary directly when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it. But sadly, no, nothing substantive, nothing informative--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She couldn't answer the question, or--",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Either couldn't or wouldn't. And frankly, that says a lot, right? In terms of they type--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What was the question?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Well, among other things, their justification for the federalization of the National Guard, not only not necessary, but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles, and also just truth. You know, for all the talk about the focus and targeting of violent criminals, if that's all the Trump administration was doing, there would be no debate. There is no disagreement on that. But as you're hearing more and more stories of undocumented, long term residents of the United States who are otherwise law abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families and, frankly, working in jobs that under the first Trump administration, when the COVID pandemic hit, were deemed essential.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Right? Workers in restaurants, in agricultural fields, in health care, construction, etc. That's who's being targeted now, and that's why there's so much fear and terror in communities, not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the vast majority of immigrants in California, we went and we looked at the stats. They are in this country legally, but Pew Research says your state has nearly 2 million undocumented and they make up about 7% of the entire labor force in some of those farming and service jobs that you you talked about. Since the Trump administration this week told ICE to pull back a bit when it comes to enforcement. Do you see that as a step in the right direction, and do you know what triggered that decision?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Yeah, so I don't know exactly what triggered that decision. I'll take it. Is it a step in the right direction? It's at least a baby step. Let's hope there's more to follow, because they're responding to what I and others have been saying for months and months and, frankly, years, going back to the first Trump administration. You want stats. Let's talk about stats. The state of California, the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, mostly documented, some undocumented. This is the same California that is the largest economy of any state in the nation, fourth largest economy in the world, not despite the immigrant population, but thanks to the contributions of so many immigrants as workforce, as consumers and as entrepreneurs. So again, focus on the dangerous, violent criminals. No disagreement there, but the folks are otherwise law abiding, tax paying and enriching communities, there's got to be a better way, a pathway towards legalization, a pathway to citizenship for 'Dreamers', farm workers and others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that's- that is hoping for movement in Congress that would take some time. I did note it was interesting to see the- in the House, the Republican Hispanic Conference, put forth a letter asking for a breakdown of how many criminals were among those actually reported.",
      "SEN. PADILLA: And that was one of the key questions they had for the Secretary. Of course, she had no data, had no answer. Promised to follow up. I hope, we'll see. And I also want to be clear about this, because when I had the audacity to try to ask a question as a Senator of a Cabinet Secretary, that's what happened. And you saw the response, everybody's seen the video, it wasn't about me, right? If that's how this administration responds to the Senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there, to people without a title like United States Senator, that cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling on the policy front, we see in our polling that there still is broad support for President Trump's mass deportation policy. Our last CBS poll, as of last Sunday, showed 54% approval. There was an interesting Washington Post piece written by David Ignatius that was pretty sharp about Democrats saying that \"They've gotten the border issue so wrong for so long. It's political malpractice,\" and that he was basically arguing Democrats are handing Trump the confrontation he wanted with the military, citing actions during the first administration. Do you think that he has a point there?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Because the public approval is so high in deportation.",
      "SEN. PADILLA: It depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the same people, do they think we should maintain due process in the United States of America, the answer is overwhelmingly yes. Do 'Dreamers' deserve better than the limbo that they find themselves in? Overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, yes. And so I think it's important to break down three things. Number one, do we need a safe and secure, orderly, humane border? Absolutely, no disagreement. People seeking to come to the United States, whether it's to seek asylum on work pieces, etc., we definitely have to modernize that system and be more strategic in those capacities. But we can't forget the millions of long term residents, people who have been here, working, paying taxes, raising families, buying homes, contributing to the strength of our economy. They deserve better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You are the ranking member on the Senate Rules Committee which oversees the Capitol Police. What if anything can you tell us about the state of security for lawmakers, given what's happening in Minnesota?",
      "SEN. PADILLA",
      "Look, a lot of questions, a lot of concerns, and work directly with both the US Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms, and they're doing what they need to do to ensure the safety of members of Congress. But I also think it's more than appropriate to step back and say, why are tensions so high? Not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country. And I can't help but point to the beginning of not just the first Trump term, but the beginning of the campaign, the tone with which the President had launched his first campaign for President, served throughout his first term, and continues in this term, for a cabinet secretary during a press conference to not be able or be willing to de escalate a situation when I was trying to ask a question that's just indicative--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You wanted her to say, wait a second, I know who he is. Calm down. Let him go. Is that what you're saying?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: The vast majority of people in that room knew who I was. I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard's member. It's the Los Angeles press corps. It said United States Senate on the chest of my polo.",

      "What is No Kings Day?",

      "\"The flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,\" the \"No Kings\" website says. \"On June 14th, we're showing up everywhere he isn't \u2014 to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\"",

    "summary": "The exchange of fire comes as talks on Iran's nuclear program in Oman between the U.S. and Iran were called off.",
    "story": [
      "Israel unleashed airstrikes across Iran for a third day on Sunday and threatened even greater force. Also Sunday, some Iranian missiles evaded Israel's air defenses to strike buildings in the heart of the country. The exchange of fire\u00a0comes as talks on Iran's nuclear program in Oman between the U.S. and Iran were called off.",
      "The simultaneous strikes represented the latest salvo since a surprise attack by Israel three days earlier aimed at decimating Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Iran said Israel struck two oil refineries, raising the prospect of a broader assault on Iran's heavily sanctioned energy industry that could affect global markets.",
      "The Israeli military, in a social media post, warned Iranians to evacuate arms factories, signaling what could be a further widening of the campaign. Around noon local time, explosions were heard again in the Iranian capital, Tehran.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that if the Israeli strikes on Iran stop, then \"our responses will also stop.\" He said the United States \"is a partner in these attacks and must take responsibility.\"",
      "New explosions echoed across Tehran and were reported elsewhere in the country early Sunday. The Washington-based Human Rights Activists group said Sunday that the Israeli strikes in Iran have killed at least 406 people and wounded another 654. The group was working to identify who among the casualties were civilians and who were part of the security services.",
      "Iran's government has not offered overall casualty figures as it struggles with the strikes that have decimated its military leadership and targeted its nuclear sites. Individual officials have offered partial figures.",
      "On Saturday, Iran's U.N. ambassador said 78 people had been killed and more than 320 wounded.",
      "In Israel, at least 10 people were killed in Iranian strikes overnight and into Sunday, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service. It brought the country's total death toll to 13, including a 10-year-old and a 9-year-old in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, since the strikes began on Friday night.",
      "Iran has fired over 270 missiles, 22 of which made impact, according to official Israeli figures.",
      "Israeli strikes targeted Iran's Defense Ministry early Sunday after hitting air defenses, military bases and sites associated with its nuclear program. The killing of several top generals and nuclear scientists in targeted strikes indicated that Israeli intelligence has penetrated Iran at the highest levels.",
      "Israel \u2014 widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East \u2014 has sophisticated multi-tiered air defenses\u00a0that are able to detect and intercept missiles fired at populated areas or key infrastructure, but officials acknowledge it is imperfect.",
      "Israel's defense minister warned Saturday that \"Tehran will burn\" if Iran continues\u00a0firing missiles at Israel.",
      "Speaking after an assessment meeting with the army's chief of staff, Defense Minister Israel Katz said Iran will pay a heavy price for harming Israeli citizens. At least three people have died in Israel, and dozens were wounded, Israel Defense Forces officials said Saturday morning.",
      "\"If (Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front \u2014 Tehran will burn,\" Katz said.",
      "Following Israel's expanded assault, Katz followed up early Sunday morning with a post that read, \"Tehran is burning.\"",
      "Urgent calls to de-escalate",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the destruction of Iran's nuclear program his top priority, brushed off urgent calls from world leaders to de-escalate, saying Israel's strikes so far are \"nothing compared to what they will feel under the sway of our forces in the coming days.\"",
      "Israel's initial assault used warplanes \u2014 as well as drones smuggled into the country in advance, according to officials \u2014 to hit key facilities and kill top generals and scientists.",
      "\"The individuals who were eliminated played a central part of the progress toward nuclear weapons,\" the IDF said in a news release. \"Their elimination represents a significant blow to the Iranian regime's ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\"",
      "Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook the buildings below. The Israeli military urged civilians, already rattled by 20 months of war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, to head to shelter for hours. U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that U.S. forces helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles on Friday.",
      "Iran calls nuclear talks \"unjustifiable\"",
      "Israel's ongoing strikes have halted \u2014 for now \u2014 diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran. Oman's foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said on social media that talks on Sunday \"will not now take place,\" but he added that \"diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.\"",
      "A senior administration official told CBS News, \"While there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon.\"",
      "Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, said Saturday that the nuclear talks were \"unjustifiable\" after Israel's strikes, which he said were the \"result of the direct support by Washington.\"",
      "President Trump, who has expressed full support for Israel's actions, offered a stark warning to Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets in the Middle East. He also predicted Israel and Iran would \"soon\" make a deal to end their escalating conflict.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social account early Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated that the U.S. was not involved in the attacks on Iran and warned that any retaliation directed against it would bring an American response \"at levels never seen before.\"",
      "\"However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump took to social media again to predict, \"Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal.\"",
      "The president claimed he has built a track record for de-escalating conflicts, and that he would get Israel and Iran to cease hostilities \"just like I got India and Pakistan to make\" after the two countries' recent cross-border confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump also pointed to efforts by his administration during his first term to mediate disputes between Serbia and Kosovo and Egypt and Ethiopia.",
      "\"Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran!\" he wrote. \"Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "One of Mr. Trump's allies in the senate, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning that Mr. Trump \"sent a clear message to the Ayatollahs, that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.\"",
      "Above-ground section of Natanz facility destroyed",
      "Among the key sites Israel attacked was Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.",
      "Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.",
      "U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged the infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency said four \"critical buildings\" were damaged, including its uranium conversion facility. It said there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with official procedures, said that according to the army's initial assessment, \"it will take much more than a few weeks\" for Iran to repair the damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. The official said the army had \"concrete intelligence that production in Isfahan was for military purposes.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation,\" Cotton said Iran is \"close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons,\" and that's why both Mr. Trump and Netanyahu thought \"things were coming to a head\" with Thursday night's launch.",
      "\"A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month,\" Cotton added. \"And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.\"",

      "Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0was shot and killed at her Brooklyn Park home early Saturday morning, according to a report from the Hennepin County medical examiner. Her husband Mark was shot at the home and died at the hospital. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were shot and wounded roughly 5 miles away at their home in Champlin. Both lawmakers were members of the Democratic Party, representing the northwest corner of the Twin Cities.",
      "According to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Boelter stands at 6-foot-1, weighs roughly 220 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen Saturday morning in Minneapolis, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat, dark long-sleeve shirt, light pants and carrying a dark bag.",
      "If anyone sees Boelter, officials urge people not to approach him, and to call 911. He should be considered \"armed and dangerous,\" Superintendent Drew Evans with the Minnesota BCA said. Evans added that investigators believe Boelter is working to leave the Twin Cities area.",
      "\"We still don't know if additional people are involved, but this individual is the one that we're looking as a person of interest right now. But there may be other people with him and we would like to speak to anybody that may have had contact with him at any point in time,\" Evans said.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a photo Saturday afternoon that appears to show Boelter standing outside of one of the lawmakers' homes, wearing a mask and dressed like a police officer.",
      "Authorities said Sunday morning they found a vehicle belonging to Boelter in Sibley County, about 60 miles southwest of where the shootings occurred. An emergency alert sent to residents asked them to lock their doors and secure their vehicles while law enforcement searches the area.",
      "The FBI says it is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Boelter's arrest and conviction.",
      "Anyone with information about Boelter's whereabouts is asked to call the tipline at 877-996-6222 or email\u00a0bca.tips@state.mn.us.",

We are working with our law enforcement partners and using every available resource to locate and apprehend Vance Boelter. We urge anyone with information to come forward\u2014no detail is too small.

      "What we know about Vance Boelter",
      "Boelter's known address is a rural home in Sibley County, near the town of Green Isle.",
      "He works as the director of security patrols at Praetorian Guard Security Services. He previously worked as a general manager at a convenience store chain and at a food manufacturer, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "In 2016, Boelter was appointed as a private sector representative to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Council by former Gov. Mark Dayton. He served until 2019, when he was appointed by Gov. Tim Walz as a business member on the Governor's Workforce Development Board. His term ended in January of 2023, according to state records.",
      "Records show Hoffman served on the same 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. The board advises the governor and the state legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce.",
      "In a press conference, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman. Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "He had been living most recently in a home in north Minneapolis, according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation.",
      "Officials said Brooklyn Park police arrived at Hortman's home around 3:35 a.m. and found a police SUV with emergency lights on. The suspect then exited Hortman's home and exchanged gunfire with officers before fleeing on foot. Investigators said they believed the suspect was dressed like a police officer.",
      "There was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in Boelter's vehicle. The list named more than 50 individuals, including officials outside of Minnesota, as well as abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "There were also fliers in his car referencing a \"No Kings\" rally. Following the shootings, officials canceled all \"No Kings\" protests that had been planned in the state for Saturday, though thousands still attended the rally in St. Paul.",

      "Large crowds of people lined up along the parade route to watch the festivities.",
      "Here's what else to know:",
      "Why is the festival and parade being held on June 14?",
      "The Second Continental Congress, on June 14, 1775, voted to establish official companies following the fighting at Lexington and Concord against British troops. Congress voted to create the Continental Army and then, on June 15, appointed George Washington as commander in chief.",
      "Planning has been in the works for almost two years to commemorate the anniversary with a festival, according to Army officials, but a parade was only added earlier this year. Army officials said the Army is not expected to officially recognize Mr. Trump's birthday.",
      "How much did the event cost?",
      "Army officials estimate the entire festival and parade could cost between $25 million and $45 million but did not disclose the cost before the parade was added to the schedule.",
      "When asked by members of Congress about the justification for the cost, as the Trump administration has sought cuts across the federal government, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said the United States has an \"an amazing opportunity\" to tell a story about the Army.",
      "\"I believe very specifically that telling that story will directly lead to a recruiting boom that will fill up our pipeline for the coming years,\" Driscoll told the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "What's the parade route?",
      "The parade started at 6 p.m. ET \u2014 half an hour earlier than originally scheduled. The parade route runs alongside the National Mall, on Constitution Avenue from 23rd Street NW to 15th Street NW, starting near the Lincoln Memorial and ending near the White House.",

      "When was the last time D.C. hosted a military parade?",
      "The most recent time D.C. hosted a military parade was in 1991, to mark the end of the Gulf War. The National Victory parade featured around 8,000 service members, and about 200,000 people watched the parade. According to The Washington Post, the event cost $8 million.",
      "How has the military prepared for the event?",
      "The Army had been laying down metal plates to prevent damage to D.C. roads by some of the heavier equipment, like M1A1 Abrams tanks, which can weigh over 60 tons. If there is any damage to the roads, the Army has committed to paying for the repair.",
      "An Army spokesperson said the military would strategically place 1-inch steel plates \u2014 in sizes ranging from 4 feet by 8 feet to 8 feet by 20 feet \u2014 at points where the equipment will turn.",

Jesse Curry, director of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, said during a security briefing on Monday that in addition to the plates, \"the tanks all have brand new rubber track pads placed on them, which increase the padding that they have underneath each track to minimize that potential damage, and it's a parade, so they're going to be moving slowly.\"",
      "What soldiers and equipment are participating?",
      "About 6,600 soldiers representing every era of the Army's 250 years of history are participating in the parade, according to Army officials. In addition, the Army said about 150 vehicles and more than 50 aircraft would participate in the celebration.",
      "The parade features different eras of the Army's history, from the Revolutionary War to the modern era and into the future with corresponding uniforms and equipment.",
      "Army officials say among the equipment are 26 M1A1 Abrams tanks, 27 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two World War II Sherman tanks, a World War I-era Renault tank, eight CH-47 helicopters, 16 UH-60 Black Hawks and four WWII-era P-51 aircraft.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump attended a military parade\u00a0in Washington, D.C., Saturday to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary, as he also celebrated his 79th birthday.",
      "The 250th Birthday of the U.S. Army Grand Military Parade and Celebration, as it was officially called, featured thousands of soldiers, an array of tanks and other military vehicles, and dozens of aircraft. A large crowd of spectators lined the parade route along the National Mall to watch.",
      "Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump walked on stage to the tune of Hail to the Chief and a 21-gun salute before the parade began. Vice President JD Vance, second lady Usha Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth were also in attendance.",
      "Following the parade, Mr. Trump delivered remarks where praised the U.S. Army as \"the greatest, fiercest and bravest fighting force ever to stride the face of this earth,\" adding, \"You make us strong, and tonight, you have made all Americans very proud.\"",
      "He recounted the history of the Army's founding in 1775 and some of the daring missions American soldiers have undertaken to defend the nation. \"Every other country celebrates their victories,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's about time America did too.\"",
      "Preparations had been underway all week in Washington, with tanks and other military equipment arriving and fencing going up in parts of the city around the White House and National Mall.",
      "What's the purpose of the military parade?",
      "Saturday's events were intended to mark the 250th birthday of the Army. The U.S. Army was established on June 14, 1775, by the Second Continental Congress, a little over a year before the Declaration of Independence was signed. It was first called the Continental Army, and George Washington was appointed its first commander.",
      "More broadly, the president declared Saturday a celebration of the country, intended to recognize America's accomplishments both on the battlefield and off it. Mr. Trump has particularly touted America's victories in World War I and World War II.",
      "\"I think it's time for us to celebrate a little bit, you know,\" the president said Wednesday. \"We've had a lot of victories. We've won two world wars \u2026 I think it's a time to celebrate our military.\"",

      "Protests held on Saturday",
      "Protesters showed their opposition to the military parade and to Mr. Trump himself in cities across the country.",
      "Labor unions and liberal activists aimed to counter-program the day's festivities with \"No Kings\" rallies to protest what they see as Mr. Trump's overreach in his role as chief executive.",
      "The organizers had not planned major demonstrations in D.C., although some protesters did congregate across from the White House.",
      "\"Instead of allowing this birthday parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption,\" they said on their website. \"For that reason, NO KINGS is not hosting an event in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Political backlash to the president's military parade",
      "The president's parade plans received criticizism for both the cost and the optics. As the administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have been touting their efforts to eliminate waste, the parade and festivities to celebrate an armed services branch anniversary are estimated by the Army to cost\u00a0between $25 million and $45 million.",
      "\"Trump is throwing himself a $30 million birthday parade just to stroke his own ego,\" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost both of her legs in Iraq, said on X last week.",
      "Some think military parades are evocative of authoritarian regimes. \"Never been a big fan of goose-stepping soldiers and big tanks and missiles rolling down the street,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters this week. \"So, if you ask me, I wouldn't have done it.\"",
      "\"We were always different than the images you saw of the Soviet Union and North Korea,\" Paul added. \"We were proud not to be that. And I don't \u2014 I'm not proposing that that's the image people want to project, but I'm worried about the image that it isn't necessarily the best image to show.\"",
      "Democrats have also criticized the president for warning people against participating in protests against the parade.",
      "\"If there's any protesters that want to come out, they're going to be met with very big force,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware called the president's message an \"authoritarian tactic.\"",
      "\"He wasn't talking about people who were engaged in violence,\" Murphy said of Mr. Trump's remarks in an interview with podcaster Joe Gallina. \"He wasn't talking about people who were doing property damage in D.C. He just said anybody who comes out to protest my military parade is going to be treated roughly. That's an authoritarian tactic.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, told reporters Wednesday that \"the president absolutely supports peaceful protests.\"",
      "\"He supports the First Amendment. He supports the right of Americans to make their voices heard,\" she continued. \"He does not support violence of any kind. He does not support assaulting law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their job.\"",

    "summary": "The move marks a significant pivot for the Trump administration, which has vowed to deport millions of immigrants living in the country without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's crackdown on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News.",
      "The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "The scaling back of some ICE operations reflects increased concern among industry leaders that the Trump administration's aggressive and government-wide immigration crackdown was hindering their businesses and the broader U.S. economy by spooking their workforce.",
      "It also marks a significant pivot for the Trump administration, which has vowed to deport millions of immigrants living in the country without legal status, regardless of whether they have criminal histories. And it comes amid a vast expansion in immigration arrests across the U.S. that has triggered protests against ICE activity in major American cities, including Los Angeles, where President Trump has deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines in response to instances of violence.",
      "Asked about the catalyst for the sudden decision to limit ICE enforcement, one of the sources said the president was not aware of the scale of the agency's operations.",
      "\"Once it hit him, he pulled it back,\" the source said.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to preview the policy change during a White House event earlier in the week, describing an upcoming \"order\" to protect farms and hotels relying on immigrant workers.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're gonna have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Asked about the move, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the move.",
      "Mr. Trump came into office in January promising to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history. His administration quickly reversed limits on ICE operations put in place by previous administrations and moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants, greatly expanding the pool of those at risk of being arrested and deported.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE arrests have increased sharply, with the agency adopting more aggressive tactics, including efforts to arrest migrants and asylum-seekers attending their court hearings and check-in appointments.",
      "So far in June, ICE has averaged more than 1,300 arrests each day, a more than 100% increase from President Trump's first 100 days in office, when the agency recorded a 660 daily arrest rate, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News. On Saturday, ICE was holding more than 56,000 individuals in detention facilities throughout the country, a record high, the figures show.",
      "While ICE operations have expanded recently, the arrests recorded by the agency remain well below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.",

    "summary": "An estimated 4 million Americans will lose health insurance over the next decade if Congress doesn't extend enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety. Some have ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. One says he previously invested in a vaccine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy \"has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints\" on the panel and said that ethics agreements would be made public for the new members before they begin work for the ACIP.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Pediatrician Dr. Vincent Iannelli questioned Pebsworth's objectivity in a post Wednesday on his Vaxopedia website, citing a 2009 blog post where she described her advocacy on the issue.",
      "\"For those of us within the vaccine-injured communities who are fighting on behalf of our children for the basic human right to make voluntary, informed vaccination decisions that are based on sound science rather than ideology, it is a battle. And it is personal,\" Pebsworth wrote.",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "In an interview Levi shared on social media after the announcement, he said he would \"keep an open mind,\" but also stood by his previous call for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 shots to be suspended.",
      "\"I think it's obvious that these mRNA vaccines should not be given to anybody young or healthy. It is also not at all clear to me that they should be given to anybody, based on the evidence,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In an internal memo obtained by CBS News, the Justice Department ordered its 93 federal prosecutors' offices to beef up preparations for criminal cases stemming from unrest in communities across the country over immigration enforcement.",
      "\"Across the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,\" the memo said. \"[T]he Department has zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.\"",
      "The memo instructs U.S. Attorneys' Offices to \"diligently monitor these enforcement efforts by maintaining regular comms with their DHS and DOJ agency counterparts.\"",
      "The memo added that leadership \"should prepare their offices to provide legal support for operations in their districts. One or two duty [assistant U.S. attorneys] is insufficient. All [U.S. Attorney Office] leadership and the entire Criminal Division should be on standby. There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to \"prioritize\" any requests for search warrants or complaints in these types of cases and \"push out press releases whenever you file charges in these matters.\"",
      "The Justice Department has already filed a series of criminal cases that allege obstruction or criminal activity related to immigration operations, and has vowed to prosecute anyone who assaults officers or interferes with ongoing immigration actions amid protests in Los Angeles and around the country.",
      "David Huerta, a longtime union leader, is charged in Los Angeles with conspiracy. He is scheduled for arraignment on July 7. According to a Homeland Security Investigation officer's sworn affidavit, Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that were ongoing nearby. The complaint alleged he yelled to other protesters to \"stop the vehicles,\" and said, \"It's a public sidewalk, they can't stop us.\"",
      "In a separate case, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey has filed a felony criminal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, who was attempting to visit an immigration facility in Newark on May 9. Prosecutors alleged McIver sought to stop federal agents from arresting the mayor of Newark during the confrontation. \"During her continued attempts to thwart the arrest, McIver slammed her forearm into the body of one law enforcement officer and also reached out and tried to restrain that officer by forcibly grabbing him,\" the Justice Department said. \"McIver also used each of her forearms to forcibly strike a second officer.\"",
      "McIver responded to the criminal indictment in a statement: \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "When asked for comment about the new memo to prosecutors, a Justice Department spokesman told CBS News, \"As we've said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.\"",

    "summary": "Nearly a dozen of the government's most seasoned lawyers have been relegated to what they refer to as the Justice Dept. rubber room.",
    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration swept into the Department of Justice on Jan. 20, it moved swiftly to purge, demote, transfer and otherwise sideline career lawyers not perceived to be team players or sufficiently committed to the MAGA legal agenda.",
      "Amid the upheaval and exodus of longtime federal prosecutors, one quiet 10th floor office in a remote outpost of the Justice Department has come to symbolize the withering impact of changes at the agency. Those who work there call it \"the rubber room.\"",
      "Inside, nearly a dozen of the government's most seasoned civil rights, environmental and national security lawyers have been reconstituted as members of a newly created group called the Sanctuary Cities task force.",
      "At first glance, the job seemed promising \u2014 a legal strike team that would sue municipalities the administration claimed were facilitating the violation of immigration laws, a task force undertaking a top priority for the new Justice Department leadership.",
      "But the more these attorneys looked into it, the more they concluded the task force was a sham, a Potemkin operation that seemed more aimed at stashing away career lawyers than putting them to work on a legitimate legal project, according to interviews with six people knowledgeable about the task force, all of whom painted a similar picture.",
      "Lawyers there have been assigned menial research tasks and left with hours of idle time \u2014 an effort they view as intended to coerce them into resigning, those with knowledge of the task force said.",
      "\"This is a hard thing to talk about,\" said Tom Mariani, an environmental litigator who resigned rather than accept reassignment to the rubber room. \"I can't tell you how much personal distress I feel over how these folks were treated.\"",
      "The term rubber room is an allusion to now-infamous \"reassignment centers\" where New York City officials transferred public school teachers and administrators who some considered burned out or incompetent, but who could not be fired because of union rules. But in this case, those being transferred have been elite veteran attorneys from the Civil Rights Division, the National Security Division and the Environment and Natural Resources Division whose performance had not previously been questioned.",
      "For months they did little or no work, were cut off from other Justice Department litigators who were actually working on sanctuary city cases and had no supervisors they could turn to for support, those familiar with the assignment told CBS News. At least four of those assigned to the task force have filed formal complaints with the Justice Department's inspector general alleging waste, fraud and abuse, CBS News has learned.",
      "That office declined comment on whether there is an active investigation into the treatment of the task force lawyers.",
      "None would comment for this story, fearing retaliation from the administration. But public interest lawyers and government watchdogs say their experience stands apart as an example of how callously civil servants who have dedicated their professional lives to public service have been treated.",
      "\"For the first time in modern U.S. history, we are witnessing purely vindictive and retaliatory actions being taken against non-partisan civil servants who simply performed their jobs consistent with law and policy during prior time,\" said Mark Zaid, a Washington lawyer who represents government whistleblowers.",
      "A new president, a new assignment: The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group",
      "The emails began arriving in the third week of January from then-Acting Attorney General James McHenry, landing in the inboxes of some of the Justice Department's most senior career attorneys, notifying them that they were being transferred to the newly created Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group and had 15 days to decide whether to take the new assignment or resign.",
      "Among those told they were being transferred to the task force were the two most senior career lawyers in the National Security Division, George Toscas and Eun Young Choi. Toscas, who was one of the most knowledgeable counterterrorism lawyers in the federal government, took personal leave instead of showing up at the task force offices. Choi, a highly experienced cyber and crypto prosecutor, also took personal leave. Both have since left the department.",
      "Mariani, who was the chief of the enforcement section of the Environment and Natural Resources section, was a 40-year veteran of the Justice Department who had reached retirement age. He said he opted to exit rather than take the new assignment.",
      "Those who did accept the assignment arrived in the isolated offices during what some called a Department of Justice in turmoil, former senior prosecutors told CBS News.",
      "Puzzles and streaming shows",
      "In this environment, several people familiar with the matter told CBS News that lawyers assigned to the new sanctuary cities section felt they had few options. They showed up for their first day \u2014 Feb. 12 \u2014 at a satellite building of the Justice Department known informally as 2Con for its address at 2 Constitution Avenue. Their handler was Kendra Wharton, an associate deputy attorney general who had worked on multiple legal cases involving President Trump before joining the department.",
      "Wharton rarely, if ever, showed up at the 10th floor office at 2Con. Some lawyers said they never saw her at the rubber room in the nearly three months they were on the task force.",
      "In the first few weeks, she communicated with the group on video calls to give them their assignments. On Feb. 13, at 9:30 a.m., Wharton called in from Justice Department headquarters while the attorneys gathered around a monitor. According to a source familiar with the call, she asked them to research the sanctuary city policies in several heavily Democratic states. The lawyers asked if they could contact the Civil Division lawyers handling the litigation in those states, but Wharton told them she was to be the single point of contact.",
      "\"A 10th grader could have done it,\" one source familiar with the work remarked bitterly.",
      "Two weeks later, Wharton asked the lawyers to compile information on three additional states. On March 5, Wharton asked for \"emergency\" follow up on a single city, according to one source. A few days later she added one more blue state to the places she wanted studied.",
      "After that, Wharton received a different mandate, and she is no longer supervising the lawyers, a Justice Department official said. Work in the rubber room slowed to a halt.",
      "\"Having worked around the clock for years, if not decades, the imposed idleness was something I could not get used to,\" said one lawyer who was assigned to the task force.",
      "The lawyers continued coming into 2Con each morning but had to find activities to occupy their time. Some completed jigsaw puzzles and streamed television shows like \"The Last of Us\" and \"Succession.\" One lawyer, Deborah Harris, whose previous job had been head of the Environment and Natural Resources Division's crimes section, could be seen practicing Italian on Duolingo.",
      "Reached for comment, Harris confirmed some details about some of the ways she passed her time in the rubber room but declined to say anything more.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said, \"The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group is focused on important work to advance top priorities of this administration.\"",
      "Turmoil inside the Justice Department",
      "The rubber room is just the latest in a series of personnel moves that critics of the administration have tracked. Some have been demoted within their own units. Bruce Swartz, the highly respected head of the Office of International Affairs, was notified by email that he was being transferred to the office's training program, a job that fell several rungs below his position. He opted to resign.",
      "Nearly a dozen prosecutors in the Public Integrity Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York quit rather than sign onto legal actions they objected to \u2014 such as the decision in February to drop the prosecution of New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "And at the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office, the interim top prosecutor fired or demoted dozens of assistant U.S. attorneys who had won convictions against hundreds of rioters who assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Those who did not resign were given jobs typically assigned to junior prosecutors, sometimes referred to as \"baby AUSAs,\" like handling misdemeanors in D.C. Superior Court or working in the office's intake section screening cases for prosecution or alternative action.",
      "Harold Koh, Sterling professor of international law and a former dean of Yale Law School, served in the Justice and State Departments under four presidents from both parties. For him, the rooting out of so many lawyers represents more than the personal devastation of these government professionals \u2014 it would be a loss for the American people for years to come.",
      "\"Apart from the shabby, petty treatment of career government officials and the degradation of government institutions, the greatest injury to the American people is the harm caused by the destruction of preparedness for dealing with the next crisis,\" Koh said of this administration.",
      "\"The best and the brightest have always wanted to go to Justice,\" he added, \"but who would want to go to a place like that now?\"",

    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",

      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019 and up to now, efforts to seal them off have been unsuccessful. But on Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, reported cosmonauts aboard the station had successfully eliminated the leaks in the PrK.",
      "\"Following the most recent repair, pressure in the transfer tunnel has been stable,\" NASA confirmed in a blog post Saturday. \"This could indicate the small leaks have been sealed.\"",
      "The leak rates seen earlier could be related to \"a small amount of air flowing into the transfer tunnel across the hatch seal from the main part of the station,\" NASA said.",
      "\"By changing pressure in the transfer tunnel and monitoring over time, teams are evaluating the condition of the transfer tunnel configuration, resulting in an updated launch opportunity for the private astronaut mission.\"",
      "The flight is the fourth Crew Dragon launch chartered by Houston-based Axiom Space. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries.",

    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

      "A suspect sought by investigators in connection with the Minnesota shootings was identified as\u00a057-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, authorities said. Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally. Authorities found his car on Sunday,\u00a0CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",
      "Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home after learning about the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police chief Mark Bruley said. Hortman's home is about five miles from Hoffman's.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers went to Hortman's home, and saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the individual, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he was pronounced dead. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" A search of the individual's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers reference the anti-Trump protests that are planned in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, statewide \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Earlier in the day, the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",
      "Extensive manhunt for suspect Vance L. Boelter",
      "Investigators have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter\u00a0as the suspect in the shootings. He was last seen Saturday morning wearing a cowboy hat at a business in Minneapolis and he changed his clothes, authorities said at a news conference. Investigators said that they believe Boelter is attempting to flee the Twin Cities area.",
      "According to an emergency alert sent on Sunday to residents of Sibley County, where Boelter's rural home is located, authorities found a vehicle belonging to the suspect in Faxon Township, which is roughly 20 miles away, CBS Minnesota reported. Although Boelter's known address is that home in the Sibley County town of Green Isle, a law enforcement source told CBS Minnesota that the suspect had most recently been living at a home in north Minneapolis.",
      "The emergency alert urged county residents to lock their doors, secure their vehicles and prepare for law enforcement to ask to search properties in the area.",
      "Authorities described Boelter as a White man with brown hair. He was wearing a blue shirt, blue pants and a black tactical vest at at time of the shootings,\u00a0CBS Minnesota reported. Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask.",
      "At the news conference Saturday, investigators confirmed that Boelter is employed at a security firm. He is\u00a0listed\u00a0as director of security patrols on the website of Praetorian Guard Security Services, where his wife is named president and CEO. In a\u00a0profile\u00a0on the website of Minnesota Africans United, which is no longer active, he is also described as the company's CEO.",
      "In a\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0post last month, Boelter said he was \"looking to get back into the U.S. Food Industry\" after spending three years on projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo with a company where he has been listed as chief executive since 2021. In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",
      "Minnesota officials urged the public to reach out with any tips and said Boelter should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to call the tipline at 877-996-6222 or email\u00a0bca.tips@state.mn.us.",
      "Sources said there was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in a vehicle believed to be Boelter's that was discovered outside Hortman's home \u2014 more than 50 individuals, some of them officials beyond Minnesota, including abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "Minnesota police agencies and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are leading the investigation, with assistance from federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. U.S. Marshals have also joined the manhunt, CBS News learned.",
      "Several people have been detained and questioned, Bruley said, and police have identified \"people of interest,\" but a suspect is not in custody.",
      "A shelter-in-place order issued for Brooklyn Park in a three-mile radius around the suburb's Edinburgh Golf Course was later lifted Saturday afternoon because there's \"reason to believe suspect is no longer in the area,\" an emergency alert read.",
      "Increased security has been ordered for elected officials and others who may be at risk, he said.",
      "Suspect served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman",
      "Boelter served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman, records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "Boelter was first appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board in 2016 by then-Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton as a private-sector representative, with a term lasting through 2019, according to state records. Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",
      "Records show that Hoffman served on the 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. Of the board's members,\u00a041 are appointed by the governor, while legislative leaders name two state senators and two representatives.",
      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn on the day of the 2018 midterm elections, Boelter\u00a0posted about the importance of voting in elections.",
      "\"I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Who was Rep. Melissa Hortman?",
      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004. She and her husband, John, have two children, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Until Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",
      "He served as chair of the Human Services Committee, and also served on committees for energy, environment and health and human services, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "He and his wife Yvette were each shot multiple times, Walz said. They are out of surgery and are receiving care, Walz said. He added that his \"prayers are with\" the couple.",
      "The Hoffmans have one daughter, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",
      "Walz also thanked the responding officers, who he said showed \"bravery and swift action.\"",
      "\"We will spare no resource in bringing those responsible to justice. We will not let fear win,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"terrible shooting\" and said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation and would prosecute anyone involved \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Rep. Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, responded to the shootings in a joint statement issued alongside all members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation.",
      "\"Today we speak with one voice to express our outrage, grief, and condemnation of this horrible attack on public servants,\" the statement said. \"There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated violence. We are praying for John and Yvette's recovery and we grieve the loss of Melissa and Mark with their family, colleagues, and Minnesotans across the state. We are grateful for law enforcement's swift response to the situation and continued efforts.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he has asked Capitol Police to increase security for both Minnesota senators, Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Schumer also said he has asked Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to convene a full briefing as soon as senators return to Washington.",
      "\"As we continue to follow this terrifying situation, I urge everyone to stay safe, stay vigilant, and reject political violence in all its forms,\" Schumer said. \"But condemning violence while ignoring what fuels it is not enough. We must confront the toxic forces radicalizing individuals and we must do more to protect one another, our democracy, and the values that bind us as Americans.\"",
      "Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, in an assassination attempt by a lone gunman that killed six people and wounded 12 others, said in a statement Saturday that she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the shootings.",
      "\"My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well,\" said Giffords, who is married to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said, \"Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it.\"",

      "The streets of Washington are quiet following yesterday's parade celebrating the Army's 250th birthday, just one of many milestones we will be honoring as we get closer to marking America's own 250th next year. President Trump celebrated his 79th birthday with a rousing appreciation of our armed forces, although the event itself was somewhat subdued, amid criticism of increased politicization of the military.",

      "As the Army was marching down Constitution Avenue yesterday, dozens of organized protests of the president and his policies as part of the No King movement were held across the country.",

      "(Begin VT)",
      "LILIA LUCIANO (voice-over): The manhunt in Minneapolis entered its second day. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, accused in what Governor Tim Walz called a politically motivated assassination of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, Saturday morning.",
      "GOVERNOR TIM WALZ (D-Minnesota): This was an act of targeted political violence.",

This image from the state senator's home security camera appears to show the suspect wearing a full face mask, what looks like a police uniform, and tactical vest. This happened at around 2:00 a.m.",
      "Around 2.5 hours later, during a precautionary safety check at Representative Hortman's home, officers spotted the suspect walking out the front door. He opened fire and then ran away. Police say he left behind a car equipped with flashing white and yellow lights and a police license plate.",
      "Inside were leaflets reading \"No Kings,\" a manifesto listing more than 50 possible targets, including abortion clinics, pro-abortion rights advocates, and other lawmakers from states beyond Minnesota.",

      "And we turn now with what began Thursday as an Israeli attack on Iran in order to debilitate Iran's nuclear program. And the back-and-forth between the two countries continues to intensify, threatening an already unstable region.",
      "Our Debora Patta is in Tel Aviv with the latest.",
      "DEBORA PATTA: The conflict between Israel and Iran is in uncharted territory, as the escalating tensions enter their fourth day, with the two rivals each warning, there is worse to come.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DEBORA PATTA (voice-over): Overnight, wave after wave of Iranian drones bearing down on Tel Aviv. Most were intercepted. Those that got through destroyed homes and shops.",
      "Israel was quick to retaliate, targeting an oil refinery and hitting buildings in Tehran. There have been casualties on both sides. At least 12 Israelis were killed this weekend, but that toll was dwarfed by the damage Israel inflicted on Iran, with almost 100 civilian deaths, nearly 30 of them children, and the assassination of top military commanders and scientists.",
      "The surprise Israeli strikes began on Thursday. Israel wants to cripple Iran's nuclear capability, already hitting four major facilities, Natanz, Tabriz, Isfahan, and Fordow, as well as key energy sites. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not done yet.",

      "ZOHAR PALTI: No doubt that, without the Americans, without President Trump, nothing will be over, over here. And when the American will decide, enough is enough, whether with us or whether with the Iranians or with or without, they have the ability to end it.",
      "(End VT)",
      "DEBORA PATTA: Not only is Netanyahu striking Iran. He is also appealing to the hearts and minds of Iranians, hinting at regime change and urging them to stand up for their freedom.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's our Debora Patta in Tel Aviv.",
      "Thank you.",
      "And the conflict between Israel and Iran has undermined President Trump's efforts to negotiate directly with Iran on a nuclear deal. Overnight, he vowed in a social media post that, if the U.S. was attacked in any way by Iran, that the \u2013 quote \u2013 \"full strength and might of U.S. armed forces would come down at levels never seen before,\" and then seemingly offered to negotiate a deal between Iran and Israel.",
      "We go now to Holly Williams, who is at Iran's border with Iraq.",
      "HOLLY WILLIAMS: Here in the Middle East, Iran has accused the U.S. of being complicit in Israel's attack and has threatened to target American military bases and ships if the U.S. blocks Iranian strikes on Israel.",
      "But the U.S. has already done that with air defense systems and a warship, according to a U.S. military official. There are around 40,000 American troops in the Middle East, a powerful presence that aims to protect U.S. interests, including trade routes.",
      "But if Iran did try to strike American forces, the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops here in Iraq could be the most obvious target, since they're right next door. Iran previously targeted U.S. forces in Iraq with ballistic missiles back in 2020 in retaliation for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force.",
      "No U.S. service members were killed on that occasion. Since then, a series of shifts has reshaped the Middle East and weakened Iran and its proxies, the war in Gaza, Israel's decimation of the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the collapse of the Syrian regime, and now Israel's surprise attack.",
      "If Iran does target American forces this time, it would be extremely risky, because it will likely draw a sharp response from the U.S., when Iran is already under attack.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Holly Williams reporting from the Iraq-Iran border.",
      "And we're joined now in Washington by Senator Tom Cotton, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.",
      "Good morning, and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you are staying on top of all these events.",
      "When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is not America's fight unless Iran hits the U.S.",
      "Should it be such a bright line?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, what the president said in his overnight post was a clear message to the ayatollahs, that, if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.",
      "That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program poses to Israel and to the United States, because, let's remember, the Iranian regime has been terrorizing Americans. It's killed thousands of Americans. It's taken them hostage. It still chants \"Death to America.\" And it's building missiles that can strike not just our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well.",
      "And that's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life that we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months.",
      "But, as he said early last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. And I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. It was Iran's \u2013 Iran's stubbornness that ended them.",
      "President Trump was clear about that. And he is still clear that there is time, if they want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would accept that. But he's given them chance after chance, as he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in terms of the line he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military operations?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I don't think he's drawn that line. He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to support Israel\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He hasn't said that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But he \u2013 well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment.",
      "He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death, or there will be bombing. So, I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that we back Israel to the hilt. There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time. So, of course, we're going to protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world.",
      "And he said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term and in this term as well. So, we back Israel to the hilt all the way. But he's appropriately keeping all options on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us. This isn't America. This isn't an American operation.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: So, so far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over the years or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel.",
      "Now, he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament. And he has said that that can happen still through a deal. I don't think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He prefers diplomacy.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And he would like Iran to come back to the table, I think, now that Iran sees that Israel and America mean business\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. If that doesn't happen, though, I think these strikes are going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain.",
      "It's long been assessed that only the U.S. has the capability with a bunker-buster bomb to take it out. Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordnance penetrator to Israel to finish the job?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might use\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should they?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 to protect our own interests.",
      "I will simply say this. It is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. It doesn't have those 30,000-pound penetrating munitions. But, as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night, when the Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has more than a few tricks up their sleeve.",
      "And I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the U.S. intelligence that was made public in March said at the time the U.S. does not assess Iran's building a nuclear weapon and that the supreme leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended back in 2003.",
      "Was there more recent U.S. intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind of sprint for a bomb?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of the uranium to near weapons-grade over the four years of the Biden administration. And they\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not weaponization. You know that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: They are \u2013 they are close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons.",
      "Now, that's not the only step to having a weapon. You also have to have the weapon design. We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. And then, if you want to use a missile, obviously, you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. But Iran has other delivery methods as well, through terrorist proxies.",
      "So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu thought we \u2013 things that were coming to a head. A second reason is, Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium-range to target Israel and short-range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month.",
      "And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but why Thursday night?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There seems to be a difference in this idea of a sprint.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President Trump \u2013 well, as President Trump said on Friday morning, that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal.",
      "That was day 61.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And he scheduled talks on day 63. You know that.",
      "I mean, this was a \u2013 this wasn't really a hard deadline.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: He gave them 60 days. On day 61, the strikes began.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Day 63, Steve Witkoff wanted to meet with them.",
      "But if this was a covert race to weaponize, though, it \u2013 it raises questions here, because it appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place in Iran.",
      "Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? Do you support his push for diplomacy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 which means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well in Iran not having a nuclear weapon.",
      "We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. We've seen their campaign of terror against Americans over the decades. That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And presidents have said \u2013 for 20 years, presidents have said that. George Bush said it, didn't act on it. Barack Obama and Joe Biden, frankly, aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not enforcing that line. It is Israel that's bombing. As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But, in \u2013 in Israel, we are helping \u2013 we're help\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 but do you share the president's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Iranian people to rise up against?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. They are today what they were Thursday morning, before these strikes started. As the president has said repeatedly, they can make a deal, or there's going to be bombing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to some domestic issues, but, very quickly, I know in the past, you have said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue to receive security. President Trump pulled it.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get it now?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We should probably revisit the threat that all persons face \u2013 remember, President Trump faced assassination threats from Iran as well \u2013 in this moment of tension, to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that security detail was pulled by the president himself.",
      "On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. Do you support this decision?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement.",
      "I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal migrant working. Usually, it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working in their worksites. And whatever worksite it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president has pulled back from that. That was the change in policy last week when it came to farms, in particular.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I don't \u2013 I don't think we should \u2013 I don't think we should pull back to any \u2013 on any kind of enforcement at all.",
      "I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, where it could impact the economy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we should \u2013 we should not \u2013 we should not declare any industry or any worksite that uses large numbers of illegal immigrants off-limits for enforcement of federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about the enforcement to date.",
      "As you know, there has been outcry. We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to California.",
      "You referred to it as \"the threat from the radical left, an overwhelming show of force to end the riots,\" and talked about communities being terrorized.",
      "Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, when you see left-wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles at police officers and shooting them with fireworks.",
      "And, unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to maintain order. The next step is to call in the National Guard. And if the governor won't call on the National Guard, then the president has to federalize them.",
      "We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. But, if they can't, or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent yesterday. They fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: The L.A. police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed, and they couldn't manage the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by two senators in a rare bipartisan interview, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. They're co-sponsors on legislation to put secondary sanctions on Russia.",
      "Good morning to you both.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina): Good morning.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to that conflict in a moment, but starting here on the Middle East, Senator Graham, you said you believe it's in America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job.",
      "It sounds like you mean offensive support.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy \u2013 I prefer that \u2013 or through military action.",
      "If diplomacy is not successful, and we are left with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that, when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs. If that means flying\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bunker-busting bombs?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Whatever bombs.",
      "If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the U.S. get?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy, as well as the world.",
      "A nuclear-armed Iran is a unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel, but to the United States as well. And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace.",
      "I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our service men and women, but also the civilians that are there. I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut who are deeply worried about their children who are there, about the hostage families.",
      "I support the president's effort to prioritize diplomacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk more about this after the commercial break, so please stay here with us.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're looking for more Face the Nation, including extended interviews and special content, you can subscribe to our podcast. It's available on all platforms, including Apple Podcast, Spotify and Amazon.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return now to our conversation with Senators Graham and Blumenthal.",
      "Senator Blumenthal, before we get to Ukraine, I just want to tie up the Middle East here.",
      "You know, the defense secretary was testifying to Congress this week, and he said he's moved equipment meant to counter drones in Ukraine over to the Middle East now because of this escalation.",
      "What more is needed to protect U.S. personnel?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We need to move assets. And we've done so. Not only to protect U.S. personnel, but also to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation.",
      "But I think that the president is right to try to bring the two sides together. There is a deal that's possible here if Iran were to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel but the entire regional stability, because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if Iran does as well. But Americans have no interest in a forever war. And so I think we need to be mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together, as well as protecting U.S. personnel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator Graham, the \u2013 the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli prime minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A regime he says is calling for the destruction of his state.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there if it's truly this existential. Is this just leading us towards the outcome you say, which is the United States getting involved in military conflict?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, this \u2013 I would love for the regime to fall. If you don't, if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people to oppress the Iranian people. You want people to threaten their neighbors, to \u2013 to be the largest state \u2013 who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? But regime change is not the policy of the United States. It is not the purpose of this attack yet. But if there is one attack on an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change.",
      "So, what are we dealing with? We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. They can't have a nuclear program that can make a bomb. Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. And I said as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President, President Trump, you've been great, help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs. Fly with them if necessary.",
      "I cannot stress to you how \u2013 if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better, you want to convince international terrorism we mean business, you've got to finish the job with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's any willingness to negotiate. So far, we haven't seen much.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, that's a big mistake on Iran's part. It's not on President Trump's. If we don't have notions, it's not because of Trump, it's because of the ayatollah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or \u2013 you can't necessarily bomb someone into concessions that they were not willing to make, right? I mean here \u2013 is there \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I don't think they have any desire to make concessions.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: If \u2013 if Iran miscalculates now \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It will face the consequences. But there is a road to a deal. President Obama reached a deal. Far from perfect. President Trump ripped it up. If it were in effect, maybe we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. They're close to ten bombs now. But there is the possibility of diplomacy. In the meantime, the United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to clarify, when you say close to ten bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel? But as far as we know, from the U.S. assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn that into a weapon. We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when I asked that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What purpose do you need \u2013 if I may, what purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60 percent other than making a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leverage (ph).",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why do you have 900 pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, the \u2013 the assessment was they wanted the leverage, right? So \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, right, whatever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By the way \u2013",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Finally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran and \u2013 Iran and Russia \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. And we're bipartisan on this. We say the same, actually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 you are. Iran and Russia work together.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: And, you know, if I can just add one more point about Iran \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran, which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of exerting pressure. I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham and I \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I will be your wingman. We'll write the bill right here on television. China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian oil and stop helping the Iranians. You would make the world a safer place if you would stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They buy it because it's cheap, though. And they \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, they \u2013 well, you know \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that \u2013 but right now \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well then, they should play a price for propping up Putin's war machine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We should crush their economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So, tell me about that. So, with the \u2013 the sanctions bill that you all are working on, you have a veto-proof majority.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just need the Senate leader to put it to a floor and you need the president to tell him go. What are you waiting for?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think the president should call on the Senate to vote approval of the Russian sanction bill literally tomorrow. He's on his way tonight to the G-7 meeting. He will be sitting across from world leaders. Right now, very bluntly, the perception may be one of weakness in terms of America's position on Ukraine. He can be there in a position of strength. This bill will pass overwhelmingly. It has 84 evenly divided co- sponsored. It will get 90 votes on the floor of the Senate.",
      "This moment cries out for presidential leadership. There is an urgency here. We've seen the neighborhoods decimated, people killed in their sleep, women and children shot in the back of their heads and buried in mass graves in Bukha. Children who are kidnapped and re-educated, 20,000 of them, behind Russian lines. These atrocities are ongoing. And the people of Ukraine are bleeding and dying.",
      "So, I am hoping that the president will affirmatively show leadership here and call on the Senate to vote. The majority leader could do it tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We have some technical issues to work out. But I really think the moment has come for President Trump to call on the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, President Trump tweeted yesterday that he did speak to Vladimir Putin, who called very nicely to wish me a happy birthday and talk about Iran.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said they're going to speak again this week.",
      "President Trump has put sanctions on Iran while talking to Iran. Why won't he put sanctions on Russia while talking to Russia?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We have sanctions on Russia. He \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not new Trump sanctions. You know that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Just \u2013 so, I find it odd. So, my Democratic friends are holding him back when it comes to Iran. We appreciate you trying to do diplomacy. What am I saying? Do diplomacy with Iran until it doesn't work. What am I saying with Russia? I don't mind you \u2013 I don't care if you go on vacation with Putin. I don't care how it ends. I want the war to end so we don't start new wars. I want our \u2013 Ukraine surviving when the war ends. I want Putin not to be overly rewarded for the invasion.",
      "To China, if you stop buying Russian oil, cheap, and India, the war machine would grind to a halt. President Trump has tried diplomacy. And I will say this, I talked to him last night, you've made very sincere efforts to get Putin to the table. I think he's playing a game with you and the entire world. It is now time to change the game with Putin.",
      "I talked to President Trump last night. Stay tuned. If we do not have a breakthrough soon, I would expect that these sanctions will move through the Senate and the House. And to China, if you want your economy ruined, keep buying Russian cheap oil. If you want to be a new nation in the eyes of the civilized world, change your behavior regarding Putin and the ayatollah. And until you change your behavior \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You're going to be seen as a problem, not a solution.",
      "So, these sanctions are coming if Putin doesn't change. And to my good friend Dick, you've been a great ally. If we can't get the ayatollah back to the table, it is now time to end his nuclear program using military force, jointly with Israel if we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If we get Iran wrong, good luck with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, the bill that you put forward will put a 500 percent tariff, as I understand it, on imported goods from countries that buy Russia's oil, their uranium, their gas, other products. It would hit China. It would hit India. The U.S. is also trying to negotiate trade deals with them. Is that getting in the way?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think there is really no obstacle to our moving ahead with these bone-crushing sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if oil prices spike because of what's happening in the Middle East?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: You know, we are now energy independent when it comes to oil, the United States. Europe has weaned itself off Russian oil. We visited with President Macron, we've talked to Chancellor Merz. Europe is solidly behind these sanctions. And we've incorporated flexibility in this bill based on our national security for a potential waiver where our interests are concerned, unforeseeable or unknowably right now. We've incorporated exceptions for our European allies who are aiding Ukraine in the billions of dollars, giving them a little bit more time to adjust.",
      "This is a carefully constructed bill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They get 20 percent of their gas from Russia, right?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Can \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What he says, that there's three categories. If you're not doing business with Russia, you don't have anything to worry about. If you're doing business with Russia but you're helping Ukraine, you have a carveout for 270 days. If you're doing business with Russia and not helping Ukraine, you're screwed. The president can waive part or all of this based on our national interest. But to the people who wonder, should we pay a price for our freedom? We have in the past.",
      "Go to Arlington. Oil prices will go up if we confront Russia through our bill. Oil prices will go up if we try to confront Iran for their nuclear ambitions. But you pay now or you pay later.",
      "If we get Iran right and we get peace with Russia/Ukraine, not only do oil prices come down, the world will be better off. So, this idea of having freedom and not sacrificing never existed, nor does it exist now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to ask you as well about what's happening here at home with the protests we have seen around the country and some of them at times turning violent. There has been criticism of Democrats' policies on immigration. Do you think that this confrontation that we are seeing now, between military forces, federalized, and protesters is partly because of what Democrats have done to date?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The use of military, whether it's the National Guard or the Marines, can be inflammatory and provocative. We had protests across the country yesterday that were entirely peaceful. I was at a number of them in Connecticut, in Hartford and Farmington and elsewhere, all around the country. I think this country knows how to do peaceful protest. And the exceptions ought to be handled by the local police and prosecutors locally.",
      "I spent most of my life in law enforcement before I had this job. I was the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut. Then I was attorney general for 20 years. And the reliance on state and local police I think is well-founded. And I've supported \u2013 in fact, I've introduced a bill that would limit use of the Insurrection Act, would define better what is a rebellion, and compel the president to come back to Congress for approval if he uses this kind of federal force.",
      "So, I think that there are criticisms to be made of immigration policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: In fact, I favor comprehensive immigration reform. We need it. But that is separate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would call on local law enforcement to perhaps stand up more and deal with it at the local level?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It's the local level where law enforcement happens in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We rely on state and local police. And that ought to be the way we enforce our laws in this country. And emphasize the importance of peaceful protests, such as we saw yesterday around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "All right, Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview. Rare, as we said.",
      "We'll be back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Saturday, demonstrators participating in the \"no kings\" movement marched in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., as part of an organized effort to protest President Trump's policies, including recent deportation sweeps. Organizers of the \"no kings\" rally said that over 5 million people participated coast to coast.",
      "Most were peaceful. But in Salt Lake City, at least one person was injured in a shooting during a demonstration. And in Portland, Oregon, local police declared a riot outside an I.C.E. facility for a few hours before that crowd dispersed.",
      "And we're joined now by California Senator Alex Padilla.",
      "Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Thank you. Thank you. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there and including those who are living a little bit fearful right now because of what we're seeing, these increasingly cruel and extreme immigration enforcement raids. But, nonetheless, they're going to work, trying to provide for their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your personal experience with some of this. As many of our viewers saw that video of you being briefly detained when you were trying to get a question to the Homeland Security secretary. Their office \u2013 her office later said you spoke for nearly 15 minutes afterwards. Did you get the answer to the question you were trying to ask? And \u2013 and what was it?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, sadly, no. And to a little bit of context here. The reason I tried to \u2013 the reason I was at the press conference, I was \u2013 I was at a scheduled briefing with representatives at Northern Command, just a couple doors down the hall, in the same federal building, when I learned of the press conference. My briefing delayed because the folks I was supposed to meet with were at that press conference.",
      "So, I asked if we could listen in. I was escorted over. And that's what I was doing.",
      "Why? Because for months and months, whether it's in committee, the secretary herself testifying and not providing substantive answers to questions, other representatives of the department, formal letters and inquiries that we've submitted, doing my job as a senator, to get information as part of our oversight and accountability responsibility.",
      "So, to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly, when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it but, sadly, no, nothing substantive, nothing informative.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She couldn't answer the question or \u2013",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Either couldn't or wouldn't. And \u2013 and, frankly, that says a lot, right, in terms of the type of \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What was the question?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, among other things, their justification for the \u2013 the federalization of the National Guard, not only not necessary but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles. And also just truth. You know, for all the talk about the focus and targeting of violent criminals, if that's all the Trump administration was doing, there would be no debate. There's no disagreement on that.",
      "But as you're hearing more and more stories of undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families. And, frankly, working in jobs that under the first Trump administration, when the Covid pandemic hit, were deemed essential, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Workers in restaurants, in agricultural fields, in health care, construction, et cetera, that's who's being targeted now, and that's why there's so much fear and \u2013 and terror in communities, not just in Los Angeles but throughout the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the vast majority of immigrants in California, we went and we looked at the stats. They are in this country legally. But Pew Research says your state has nearly two million undocumented and they make up about 7 percent of the entire labor force in some of those farming and service jobs that you \u2013 you talked about.",
      "Since the Trump administration this week told I.C.E. to pull back a bit when it comes to enforcement, do you see that as a step in the right direction, and do you know what triggered that decision?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, so I don't know exactly what triggered that decision. I'll take it. Is it a step in the right direction? It's at least a baby step. And let's hope there's more to follow because they're responding to what I and others have been saying for months and what's frankly years, going back to the first Trump administration. You know, you \u2013 you \u2013 you want stats? Let's talk about stats. The \u2013 the state of California, the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, mostly documented, some undocumented. This is the same California that is the largest economy of any state in the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Fourth-largest economy in the world. Not despite the immigrant population, but thanks to the contributions of so many immigrants as a workforce, as consumers and as \u2013 as entrepreneurs. So, again, focus on the dangerous, violent criminals. No disagreement there. But the \u2013 the folks who are otherwise law-abiding, tax-paying and \u2013 and enriching communities, there's got to be a better way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: A pathway towards legalization. A pathway to citizenship for dreamers, farm workers and others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's \u2013 that is hoping for \u2013 for movement in Congress that would take some time.",
      "I did note it was interesting to see the \u2013 in the House, the Republican Hispanic conference put forth a letter asking for a breakdown of how many criminals were among those actually deported.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And that was \u2013 yes, that was \u2013 and that was one of the key questions I had for the secretary. Of course, she had no data, had no answer, promised to follow up, I hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: We'll see. And \u2013 and I also want to be clear about this, because when I had the audacity to try to ask a question, as a Senator of a cabinet secretary, that's what happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And you saw the response. Everybody's seen the video. You know, it wasn't about me. But if that's how this administration responds to a senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of but what they are doing when the cameras are not there to people without a title like United States senator. That cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling \u2013 on the policy front, we see in our polling that there still is broad support for President Trump's mass deportation policy. Our last CBS poll, as of last Sunday, showed 54 percent approval. There was an interesting \"Washington Post\" piece written by David Ignatius that was pretty sharp about Democrats, saying that, \"they've gotten the border issue so wrong for so long, it's political malpractice.\" And that he was basically arguing, Democrats are handing to Trump the confrontation he wanted with the military, citing actions during the first administration.",
      "Do you think that he has a point there?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: No, I think, you know, \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the public approval is so high of deportation.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well \u2013 but details matter. It depends. You know, it depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the same people, you know, do they think we should maintain due process in the United States of America, the answer is overwhelming, yes. Do dreamers deserve better than the limbo that they find themselves in? Overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, yes.",
      "And so, I think it's important to break down three things. Number one, do we need a safe and secure, ordinarily, humane border? Absolutely. No disagreement there. People seeking to come to the United States, whether it's to seek asylum, on work visas, et cetera, we definitely have to modernize that system and be more strategic in those capacities. But we can't forget the millions of long-term residents, people who have been here working, paying taxes, raising families, buying homes, contributing to the strength of our economy, they deserve better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are the ranking member on the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees the Capitol Police. What, if anything, can you tell us about the state of security for lawmakers given what's happening in Minnesota?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, look, a lot of questions, a lot of concerns. I work directly with both the U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms. And they're doing what they need to do to ensure the \u2013 the safety of members of \u2013 of Congress. But I also think it's more than appropriate to step back and say, why are tensions so high, not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country? And I can't help but point to the beginning of, not just the first Trump term, but the \u2013 the beginning of the campaign. The tone with which the president launched his first campaign for president, served throughout his first term and continues in this term. For a cabinet secretary, during a press conference, to not be able or be willing to deescalate a situation when I was trying to ask a question, that's just indicative of the tone of the administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wanted her to say, wait a second, I \u2013 I know who he is, calm down, let him go? Is that what you're saying?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: The \u2013 the vast majority of people in that room knew who I was. I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard's member. It's the Los Angeles Press Corp. It said, United States Senate on the chest of my polo.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 12:45:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Since 1996, David Letterman's racing team, Rahal-Letterman-Lanigan Racing, has won the Indianapolis 500 twice. He talks about the attraction of the sport, along with drivers Josef Newgarden and Pato O'Ward, and racing great Mario Andretti.",
    "story": [
      "It's billed as the fastest racing on earth. IndyCars, as they're called, can hit 240 miles an hour on an oval track \u2013 that's more than a football field every second. And a second is about all it takes to end someone's day.",
      "In this sport, not all the big names are drivers. David Letterman has co-owned an IndyCar team since 1996, and in that time, Rahal-Letterman-Lanigan Racing has won the Indy 500 twice.",
      "We asked Letterman himself what made IndyCar racing so appealing. \"When I was a kid, my family (and every family on our block) would have it on the radio. And it would be Memorial Day, and Dad would be home from work, and we'd be having a cookout. And I can remember listening to the broadcast sitting in a tree. So, that was my first memory of it. It wasn't an option; it was mandatory. It was part of the culture of living in Indianapolis.\"",
      "I asked, \"And now that you're a co-owner, which you've been for almost three decades now \u2013\"",
      "\"Isn't that crazy?\" he laughed.",
      "\"What's your role on race day?\"",
      "\"On race day? Listen to the race, sitting in a tree,\" Letterman replied. \"That's what they want me to do.\"",
      "There are now 17 race days every year, at tracks from coast to coast, and the sport is promoting a new crop of heroes, like Team Penske driver Josef Newgarden. He's won the Indy 500 (still considered the granddaddy of the Indy series) back-to-back, in 2023 and 2024. By tradition, the winning driver celebrates with a big swig of milk, and in 2024, Newgarden's wife and son joined him in another Indy tradition: kissing the speedway track.",
      "We caught up with Newgarden a few weeks ago before the Long Beach Grand Prix. I asked him, \"Do you have a mantra that you say? Anything you tell yourself?\"",
      "\"I don't know that I have a specific mantra, but I try not to be superstitious,\" he replied. \"I just try to be positive more than anything. If that's my mantra, it's positivity.\"",
      "Team McLaren driver Pato O'Ward has just about everything a race car driver needs; the only thing he's missing is an Indy 500 win. He's come agonizingly close, and in 2024 O'Ward just about had it won, but Newgarden passed him in the final lap. \"I know I'm going to get my Indy 500 win, because I've been damn good there every single year,\" O'Ward said. \"So, I know the more I put myself in that position, I'm going to get at least one.\"",
      "What is it like to win one of these races? According to Letterman, \"It's a jolt of adrenaline I have never experienced in my life. There was a crush of people around me. And suddenly I'm not just Dumbbell Dave, the talk show host. I'm the owner of the Indianapolis 500 winner. And that euphoria stays with you, well, you may be able to tell, I still have a touch of that in me.\"",
      "For more than a century, speed demons have been chasing IndyCar trophies. The first Indianapolis 500 dates back to 1911, and it quickly became one of the premier sporting spectacles of the year, drawing huge crowds attracted by the sound and the speed. In 1926, racers sped better than 90 miles an hour!",
      "In the last century, IndyCar racing has changed: it's much faster, and recently more popular. The IndyCar brand withered for a few years under an internal re-organization, but now the crowds are coming back. This year's Indy 500 grandstand was sold out for the first time in nearly a decade, and the place is starting to look like it did back in 1969, when Mario Andretti took the checkered flag.",
      "Asked how sweet that milk tastes, Andretti said, \"Honey cannot compare!\"",
      "At 85, Andretti's still in the game as a team owner. \"I think the ability of the drivers that you have in place [today], the talent is unprecedented,\" he said. \"It's unbelievable, yeah.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are you saying those guys are more talented than you were?\"",
      "Well, he didn't go that far.",
      "Race car safety has come a long way since Andretti's day; the track walls are now padded, the drivers are more protected. But while it's safer, it not safe, and the worst can still happen, says AP motorsports reporter Jenna Fryer. \"It'll never be safe; you can never call racing safe,\" she said. \"They can be idiots. And if they get upset with each other and one wants to retaliate against the other, you know, people do stupid stuff. They see red, they kind of forget what they're doing for a second. There's no way to ever say, 'Racing is safe.'\"",
      "But for drivers, it really is just part of the game. Asked if he ever thinks of the danger while driving, O'Ward replied, \"No. You think of winning. You think of winning when you're in that car. At least I do. That's all I think of.\"",
      "This year's Indy 500 winner wasn't O'Ward or Newgarden, or anyone from Letterman's team. It was Spanish driver Alex Palou.",
      "But there are nine more races this season, and on an oval track, you never know what's around the bend.",
      "Letterman said, \"What I love about it is the romance of it. And the sound is unlike anything you've ever heard. The sound is something humans were not meant to hear.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does that sound do to you?\"",
      "\"This is a good measure for my heart; if it doesn't accelerate my heart beyond what human's hearts should be accelerated, then there's something wrong,\" he said.",
      "When asked what he would say to someone who has never seen an IndyCar race, Letterman said, \"Oh, for God sakes, it doesn't even pertain to motor sports fans, just go. I mean, one day. It's unimaginable. And you may not go back, but you'll talk about it the rest of your life.\"",

      "The March of Annihilation",
      "Fort Ticonderoga, New York, July\u2013August 1777",
      "A rattle of drums at four a.m. on July 1, 1777, roused the British encampment at Crown Point, on the western lip of Lake Champlain. Soldiers stumbled from their tents, shrugged on their uniform coats, and gobbled down a cold breakfast with the indifference of men who expected no better. For the past fortnight the invasion force of eight thousand troops had sailed and rowed south for a hundred miles, from the Richelieu River in Quebec to within fifteen miles of the American stronghold at Fort Ticonderoga. Through mischance and rebel defiance, many of these same redcoats had failed to capture the fortress eight months earlier, despite standing at the gates. Now the prize again lay within grasp, and this time they intended to win through. \"We are to contend for the king and the constitution of Great Britain, to vindicate law and to relieve the oppressed,\" orders issued the previous evening proclaimed. \"This army must not retreat.\"",
      "By five a.m., the sun had crested the great shoulders of the Green Mountains to the east, gilding the craggy Adirondacks in the west. Platoon after platoon scuffed down to the shoreline to clamber aboard gunboats, longboats, and six-oared, flat-bottomed bateaux. Shouted orders carried across the lake, along with the creak of capstans and oarlocks. Soon the first vessels pulled away from the anchorage, to assemble mid-lake in battle formation. Army musicians caught the moment and struck up martial airs. \"The music and drums of the different regiments were continually playing,\" a Royal Artillery lieutenant wrote, \"and contributed to make the scene and passage extremely pleasant.\"",
      "More than a hundred birch-bark canoes led the flotilla. Each carried twenty to thirty warriors, mostly Iroquois sporting nose rings, slitted earlobes, and feathers in tufted topknots, their eyelids and cheeks daubed with vermilion paint. Some wore knife sheaths made from lynx skins and, a British officer recorded, an \"arse clout, or covering for the privities.\"",
      "Arrayed across the mile-wide lake behind the Indian vanguard came the main battle force, \"the most complete and splendid regatta you can possibly conceive,\" a witness reported: the three-masted frigate Royal George, built by shipwrights in Canada during the winter and carrying 26 guns, and smaller vessels named Inflexible, Carleton, Maria, and Royal Convert, as well as 44 gunboats, 23 longboats, 26 cutters, 260 bateaux, and a wallowing ninety-one-foot radeau, or raft, the Thunderer, ferrying barreled gunpowder and heavy cannons intended to blast Ticonderoga's walls to rubble. A brig, a gundalow, and a sloop\u2014Washington, Jersey, and Lee\u2014had been captured in October from the rebel general turned commodore Benedict Arnold, whose gallant, forlorn rearguard fight in these very waters had helped delay the earlier British attack until winter forced the invaders back to Canada. All told, this squadron carried 133 naval guns to complement the army's 130 field cannons, mortars, and howitzers, each barrel stamped with the king's monogram or other symbols of possession. Storeships and lake transports continued to arrive at Crown Point from the north, laden with almost five thousand tons of salt pork, hard biscuits, and other rations, along with siege tools, ammunition, rum, cattle, and civilian camp followers, whose numbers officially included 225 women and 500 children, although some hyperbolists would claim that the combined figure actually approached two thousand.",
      "\"It looked,\" wrote Corporal Roger Lamb of the 9th Regiment of Foot, \"like some stupendous fairy scene of a dream.\" By late afternoon, many troops had disembarked on either shore to join the advance regiments moving toward Ticonderoga, now just a few miles ahead. Bullfrogs croaked in the shallows, and white elderberry blossoms brightened the conifer thickets, \"the birthplace of every biting insect,\" one miserable chaplain wrote. Some men smeared cedar sap on their faces in a vain effort to repel mosquitoes and deerflies.",
      "On the left, to the east, four thousand mercenaries plodded through the underbrush. Known collectively as Hessians, since most Germans hired by London to fight in America came from Hesse-Kassel, this contingent was largely from the small, impoverished duchy of Brunswick, whose ruling family had intermarried with the British royal family. Brunswick's duke collected \u00a37 a year for each rented soldier, plus a blood-money bounty for every man killed or captured and an equivalent stipend for every three wounded. The troops earned the same eight pence a day as their British comrades, minus deductions for food and uniforms. Most of the German troops had spent an agreeable winter in isolated bivouacs along the St. Lawrence and Richelieu Rivers, developing a taste for beaver tail, salted sturgeon, and maple sugar.",
      "Jager scouts\u2014professional hunters\u2014led the column, distinctive in their green coats trimmed in crimson and black hats decorated with pompoms. Dragoons followed in leather breeches and woolen gaiters, dismounted for the moment but hopeful of finding American horses ahead. Armed with short carbines and three-foot broad-swords, many cultivated horizontal waxed mustaches and wore their hair in a queue down the back \"like a Chinese mandarin,\" an admirer wrote. Grenadiers, artillerymen, musicians, gunsmiths, servants, and sutlers filled out the procession, prodded forward by blue-coated officers wearing silver sashes and wielding canes or pointed spontoons. During the voyage down the lake, some men had stripped to the waist to bask in the warm sun and, a surgeon reported, \"have been badly sunburned, large blisters developing on their skin.\"",
      "The Germans were led by Major General Friedrich Adolph Riedesel. Thirty-nine years old, with a moon face and a ramrod bearing, he had forsaken his law studies in Marburg to take up soldiering, soon demonstrating a hussar's valor at Minden during the Seven Years' War. Fluent in French and conversational English, Riedesel considered the opportunity to command in North America to be \"sent by Providence.\" He had sworn allegiance to George III, like each of his Brunswickers, and had predicted in a dispatch to his duke that \"this campaign will finish the war.\" Although British officers could be insufferably supercilious toward their German allies, he got on well with the redcoats, even if they stumbled over the pronunciation of his name, calling him \"General Red Hazel.\"",
      "Those redcoats could now be seen across the lake, moving south in a snaking column parallel to the Germans. Brawny grenadiers, often used to lead assaults, had exchanged their tall bearskin hats for more practical felt caps trimmed in horse-hair. Each foot soldier carried a ten-pound musket, a sixteen-inch bayonet, a tin canteen, a linen haversack, and his own blanket\u2014a battlefield luxury, since in peacetime five men typically shared two blankets. British infantrymen were among the finest soldiers in the world, but most of these troops were green; only the 47th Regiment of Foot had seen extensive combat, at Lexington and Bunker Hill, among other clashes. They were led nonetheless by an exceptional cadre of junior officers, thirty of whom would become generals, including eighteen destined to be full generals, the army's highest rank. In addition, another six future general officers could be found among the twenty-two Royal Artillery officers in the column.",
      "Squinting at both shorelines through his spyglass from the pitching deck of the Royal George, Lieutenant General John Burgoyne was as pleased with his invasion force as he was with himself. At fifty-four, he had endured a long and arduous climb to high command, and he intended to return to London to claim the laurels owed every victorious commander. Educated at Westminster School, where even mathematics was taught in Latin and boys were birched for the slightest transgression, he had joined the army at fifteen, earned a reputation as both a swordsman and a card sharp, then wrecked his career by eloping with Charlotte Stanley, the youngest daughter of a very angry earl. Effectively banished to France and forced to sell his commission, Burgoyne lived modestly with Charlotte on the Seine for seven years, growing vegetables, traveling the Continent, and making a living at whist and twenty-one.",
      "At last all was forgiven, and a belated reconciliation brought the couple back to England. Burgoyne returned to duty as an aging dragoon captain, just in time to win fame at the cannon's mouth in the Seven Years' War, notably in Normandy and Brittany against the French, and on the Tagus River near Lisbon against the Spanish. The king of Portugal gave him a diamond ring in gratitude, and he emerged from the struggle as a British war hero.",
      "Burgoyne's ascent continued in peacetime. Elected to the House of Commons, he was a diligent, independent military reformer. His insights from an inspection tour of Continental armies impressed George III, as did his parliamentary investigation of East India Company corruption. He and Charlotte shuttled between fine houses in Lancashire and Surrey and on Hertford Street, in tony Mayfair, an easy stroll from the London gambling tables at Brooks's club. An aspiring playwright, he also became a regular in the Green Room at Drury Lane Theater, where in 1774 the actor and impresario David Garrick directed Burgoyne's The Maid of the Oaks, a triumphant success.",

They've got families to take care of. You need to make this army into a force that can take on the British full-time.\"",
      "It was June 14, 1775, the birth date of the United States Army. It would be, Atkinson said, \"the central institution that is going to determine whether or not the United States of America really does become a country.\"",
      "The commander of the new army is known today as the father of our country. Morando said, \"It's hard to imagine what the Revolutionary War would have been like without George Washington.\"",
      "Atkinson called Washington \"the indispensable man,\" based on \"his ability to stay the course, to believe in the cause, to transmit his belief in the cause to the soldiery.\"",
      "Washington told his troops: \"The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army.\" \"He's got a vision \u2013 he refers to generations yet unborn,\" Atkinson said. \"That would be us.\"",
      "In the summer of 1776, the Declaration of Independence was just a piece of parchment.\u00a0 Said Morando, \"It was up to our soldiers to fight and secure that independence.\"",
      "In New York, a British force of 32,000 attacked Washington's new American Army \u2013 the first battle after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Morando said, \"A lot is riding on this. He understands that if he loses this battle, he possibly could lose the war and the revolution itself.\"",
      "The British troops came ashore on Long Island, where Washington had dug in.\u00a0 \"The British devise a plan in which they outflank him,\" said Atkinson. \"It's a catastrophe. He nearly loses the whole game at this point.\"",
      "Washington barely escaped with his army, retreating across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. He wrote to his brother: \"I think the game is pretty near up.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's so 'indispensable' about that performance?\"",
      "Atkinson replied, \"People were beginning to wonder, frankly, does this guy have the right stuff? He's going to show that, among other things, he's very bold, and when he is desperate, he's dangerous.\"",
      "In an act of daring immortalized in American history, Washington crossed back over the Delaware and caught the enemy by surprise. The British had lost their chance to destroy the American Army, and Washington would fight on for seven more years.",
      "B.J. Ervik directed a team of artists who recreated the sacrifice of those years, down to the bloody knuckles of Sergeant Major William Seymour recording the day's events in his journal.\u00a0 Ervik said, \"I think that's a very reflective moment for somebody who might have just been in battle for a few days, and has a moment to reflect on what he's doing in life and what is happening around him.\"",
      "Retired Army Lt. Col. Alayne Conway posed for the figure of Anna Lane, handing a cartridge to her wounded husband. Passing the ammunition, you can see in her eyes the British are coming.",
      "\"Wow! It's pretty powerful,\" said Conway. \"I really see how strong she was.\"",
      "Leaders of today's Army got a VIP tour of their origin story, leading up to an audio-visual display of the battle at Yorktown, Virginia, where British troops finally surrendered. Dismissed early in the war as amateurs, the soldiers of the American Army withstood every hardship and challenge \u2013 and stood victorious.",
      "Through 1,300 battles and skirmishes, the Army had outlasted the British Empire. As American Major General Nathaniel Greene was quoted as saying, \"We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again.\"",
      "Atkinson said, \"One of the lessons we should take from the Revolution is we're capable of doing extraordinary things and overcoming extraordinary odds to get where we want to go.\"",
      "I asked, \"It was nasty, brutish, and long. Should we so revere this war?\"",
      "\"I think we should revere what came out of it, and we should revere the sacrifices that went into it,\" Atkinson replied. \"The creation of the American Republic \u2013 it's one of mankind's greatest achievements.\u00a0 And how can we not be proud of that?\"",
      "The last thing one sees upon leaving this exhibit is a quote from Founding Father John Adams, and it is addressed to us: \"You will never know how much it cost the present generation to preserve your freedom! I hope you will make a good use of it.\"",

      "She had newly arrived from Bangladesh to study for her master's in information technology on a student visa in 2022 and wasn't interested in a relationship.",
      "She liked the message. Then he texted again a few days later, \"Hey, I have tickets to a Broadway show.\"",
      "She had never been to a Broadway show before, so she went \u2014 and their whirlwind first date quickly turned to love for her and then marriage. On Feb. 14, 2024, the couple joined the line to get married at the New York City courthouse.",
      "\"I brought a white dress online, not very fancy and white shoes, tiara and flowers,\" she said. \"I was smiling, just looking at him. I felt really good.\"",
      "Her new husband filed for a green card for his wife. A temporary one was granted, and she moved to his family's house in Brooklyn.",
      "The future seemed bright.",
      "A rise in the threat of deportations",
      "Now, just a little more than a year later, the 31-year-old woman, who asked CBS News not to use her name due to safety fears, has separated from her husband after alleging abuse \u2014 and is now worried about being deported.",
      "As\u00a0immigration enforcement raids increase in the U.S.\u00a0 \u2013 including operations in Los Angeles, which led to protests that prompted President Trump to mobilize National Guard troops \u2014 communities are shaken watching the deportations of families, friends and co-workers.",
      "One community that's especially vulnerable, experts say, are victims of domestic violence. Crystal Justice, chief external affairs officer at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, told CBS News in a statement that they have seen abusive partners \"threatening to deport a partner or their family or withholding legal documents to limit a person's ability to travel.\"",
      "Many immigrants are in the U.S. on a visa supported by a U.S. citizen, or are undocumented, with few protections. Often, as the relationship spirals into abuse allegations, spurned or angered partners can threaten to deport their loved ones with uncertain immigration statuses.",
      "Esther Limb, immigration practice director at Her Justice in New York City, a not-for-profit that advises and trains attorneys to provide free legal help to women, said there has been a rise in the threats of deportations by abusers.",
      "\"While using immigration status against their victims is a common tactic used by many abusers, by echoing the anti-immigrant rhetoric and pointing to immigration enforcements happening in their communities, the threat of deportation by abusive spouses is louder than ever and allows abusers to wield greater power and control over their victims,\" Limb said.",
      "A massive backlog and long waits",
      "Limb represents numerous clients \u2014 including the one interviewed for this CBS News piece \u2014 in filing petitions to stay in the U.S. after alleging domestic violence. Waiting for an answer to these petitions can take years due to backlogs and vetting for the applications.",
      "Immigrants who allege abuse\u00a0can file\u00a0to stay in the U.S. under the\u00a0Violence Against Women Act, but those petitions can come with a wait of sometimes more than 36 months for an answer. These applicants are close relatives of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, and they can file for status on their own, without the abuser's knowledge, consent or participation.",
      "There were 35,917 VAWA petitions in 2024, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Petition filings have increased by more than 350% in the last decade. In 2014, there were 7,130 filings.",
      "Immigrants \u2014 including undocumented immigrants \u2014\u00a0 can also file for a nonimmigrant status visa, known as a\u00a0U-visa, if they were victims of various crimes, including domestic violence. The wait time for final approval is more than eight years, due to a massive backlog of petitions, Limb said. There were 41,558 petitions filed in 2024, doubling over the past decade, according to USCIS data. There are more than 238,000 cases currently pending.",
      "People are \"very, very scared\"",
      "In the meantime, immigrants watch, wait and worry, hoping their petition will be approved, like the woman interviewed by CBS News. She said she cries suddenly at work sometimes, waking up at night and constantly looks over her shoulder.",
      "She left her husband, she says, after various incidents of verbal and physical abuse. She claims the police came to their house, and she went to the emergency room, where she says the hospital told her she had to make a police report. She was given a list of what constitutes domestic abuse.",
      "\"I didn't want to go back,\" she said. \"...I didn't know what to do.\"",
      "She said her sister, who immigrated to the U.S. years ago came to visit her from Connecticut and told her, \"You don't have to go back.\" She then cut off all contact with her husband and his family.",
      "Then the messages and threats started.",
      "CBS News reviewed text messages and documents at the Her Justice office in New York City, allegedly from the client's former partner threatening to call ICE and deport her. She filed for a VAWA petition, her lawyer said. CBS News viewed videos of the couple's wedding day and interviewed the client, but did not reach out to the former partner for safety concerns for the client.",
      "One message read, \"1. You are my wife. 2. I am your petitioner. Lawfully you cannot just leave, as an American you are my responsibility. I'm sorry but I warned you.\"",
      "Others were sent to her sister. One text message said, \"I will be reaching out to immigration soon.\" Another said, \"ICE can show up any day and deport.\"",
      "Limb said abusers now have more power and control right now as they know they can use their partners' immigration status in the current climate.",
      "\"That is more scary than anything else for a lot of our clients to be deported or to be removed and/or separated from their children,\" Limb said. \"People are very, very scared.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump attended a military parade\u00a0in Washington, D.C., Saturday to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary, as he also celebrated his 79th birthday.",
      "The 250th Birthday of the U.S. Army Grand Military Parade and Celebration, as it was officially called, featured thousands of soldiers, an array of tanks and other military vehicles, and dozens of aircraft. A large crowd of spectators lined the parade route along the National Mall to watch.",
      "Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump walked on stage to the tune of Hail to the Chief and a 21-gun salute before the parade began. Vice President JD Vance, second lady Usha Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth were also in attendance.",
      "Following the parade, Mr. Trump delivered remarks where praised the U.S. Army as \"the greatest, fiercest and bravest fighting force ever to stride the face of this earth,\" adding, \"You make us strong, and tonight, you have made all Americans very proud.\"",
      "He recounted the history of the Army's founding in 1775 and some of the daring missions American soldiers have undertaken to defend the nation. \"Every other country celebrates their victories,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's about time America did too.\"",
      "Preparations had been underway all week in Washington, with tanks and other military equipment arriving and fencing going up in parts of the city around the White House and National Mall.",
      "What's the purpose of the military parade?",
      "Saturday's events were intended to mark the 250th birthday of the Army. The U.S. Army was established on June 14, 1775, by the Second Continental Congress, a little over a year before the Declaration of Independence was signed. It was first called the Continental Army, and George Washington was appointed its first commander.",
      "More broadly, the president declared Saturday a celebration of the country, intended to recognize America's accomplishments both on the battlefield and off it. Mr. Trump has particularly touted America's victories in World War I and World War II.",
      "\"I think it's time for us to celebrate a little bit, you know,\" the president said Wednesday. \"We've had a lot of victories. We've won two world wars \u2026 I think it's a time to celebrate our military.\"",
      "Military equipment and soldiers, by the numbers",
      "Here's what Army officials say to expect to see in the parade:",

      "Protests held on Saturday",
      "Protesters showed their opposition to the military parade and to Mr. Trump himself in cities across the country.",
      "Labor unions and liberal activists aimed to counter-program the day's festivities with \"No Kings\" rallies to protest what they see as Mr. Trump's overreach in his role as chief executive.",
      "The organizers had not planned major demonstrations in D.C., although some protesters did congregate across from the White House.",
      "\"Instead of allowing this birthday parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption,\" they said on their website. \"For that reason, NO KINGS is not hosting an event in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Political backlash to the president's military parade",
      "The president's parade plans received criticizism for both the cost and the optics. As the administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have been touting their efforts to eliminate waste, the parade and festivities to celebrate an armed services branch anniversary are estimated by the Army to cost\u00a0between $25 million and $45 million.",
      "\"Trump is throwing himself a $30 million birthday parade just to stroke his own ego,\" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost both of her legs in Iraq, said on X last week.",
      "Some think military parades are evocative of authoritarian regimes. \"Never been a big fan of goose-stepping soldiers and big tanks and missiles rolling down the street,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters this week. \"So, if you ask me, I wouldn't have done it.\"",
      "\"We were always different than the images you saw of the Soviet Union and North Korea,\" Paul added. \"We were proud not to be that. And I don't \u2014 I'm not proposing that that's the image people want to project, but I'm worried about the image that it isn't necessarily the best image to show.\"",
      "Democrats have also criticized the president for warning people against participating in protests against the parade.",
      "\"If there's any protesters that want to come out, they're going to be met with very big force,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware called the president's message an \"authoritarian tactic.\"",
      "\"He wasn't talking about people who were engaged in violence,\" Murphy said of Mr. Trump's remarks in an interview with podcaster Joe Gallina. \"He wasn't talking about people who were doing property damage in D.C. He just said anybody who comes out to protest my military parade is going to be treated roughly. That's an authoritarian tactic.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, told reporters Wednesday that \"the president absolutely supports peaceful protests.\"",
      "\"He supports the First Amendment. He supports the right of Americans to make their voices heard,\" she continued. \"He does not support violence of any kind. He does not support assaulting law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their job.\"",
      "What's the schedule?",
      "8:15 a.m. \u2013 Wreath laying at Arlington National Cemetery",
      "9:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. \u2013 Fitness competition and awards ceremony on the National Mall",

      "Here's the parade route",
      "The parade route ran along Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C., parallel to the National Mall. It kicked off at 23rd Street NW, near the Lincoln Memorial, before proceeding along the Mall past the White House and the Washington Monument. It concluded at 15th Street NW. The parade began at 6 p.m., half an hour earlier than originally planned, due to weather conditions.",

      "In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said the local government leads an investigation when it occurs in that country. \"In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support. We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",
      "Boeing said it is in contact with Air India about the crash and stands \"ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.\"",

      "The aircraft was designed by Boeing to handle longer nonstop routes, which the company says had opened up 425 new routes around the world since the aircraft was introduced.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last year ordered inspections of the cockpit seats on the Dreamliners after one of the jets went into a dive when the captain's seat lurched forward without warning and disconnected the plane's autopilot system, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Last year, a whistleblower's allegations prompted the FAA to investigate his claims about assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",

      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In an internal memo obtained by CBS News, the Justice Department ordered its 93 federal prosecutors' offices to beef up preparations for criminal cases stemming from unrest in communities across the country over immigration enforcement.",
      "\"Across the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,\" the memo said. \"[T]he Department has zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.\"",
      "The memo instructs U.S. Attorneys' Offices to \"diligently monitor these enforcement efforts by maintaining regular comms with their DHS and DOJ agency counterparts.\"",
      "The memo added that leadership \"should prepare their offices to provide legal support for operations in their districts. One or two duty [assistant U.S. attorneys] is insufficient. All [U.S. Attorney Office] leadership and the entire Criminal Division should be on standby. There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to \"prioritize\" any requests for search warrants or complaints in these types of cases and \"push out press releases whenever you file charges in these matters.\"",
      "The Justice Department has already filed a series of criminal cases that allege obstruction or criminal activity related to immigration operations, and has vowed to prosecute anyone who assaults officers or interferes with ongoing immigration actions amid protests in Los Angeles and around the country.",
      "David Huerta, a longtime union leader, is charged in Los Angeles with conspiracy. He is scheduled for arraignment on July 7. According to a Homeland Security Investigation officer's sworn affidavit, Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that were ongoing nearby. The complaint alleged he yelled to other protesters to \"stop the vehicles,\" and said, \"It's a public sidewalk, they can't stop us.\"",
      "In a separate case, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey has filed a felony criminal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, who was attempting to visit an immigration facility in Newark on May 9. Prosecutors alleged McIver sought to stop federal agents from arresting the mayor of Newark during the confrontation. \"During her continued attempts to thwart the arrest, McIver slammed her forearm into the body of one law enforcement officer and also reached out and tried to restrain that officer by forcibly grabbing him,\" the Justice Department said. \"McIver also used each of her forearms to forcibly strike a second officer.\"",
      "McIver responded to the criminal indictment in a statement: \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "When asked for comment about the new memo to prosecutors, a Justice Department spokesman told CBS News, \"As we've said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 20:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Children's deaths by gun-related homicide and suicide rose in states that had the most permissive firearm laws following a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision, a new study found.",
    "story": [
      "Gun deaths among children have risen over a 13-year period in states with lax firearm laws, according to a new study published this week in JAMA Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho and Georgia were among the states that saw a jump in pediatric gun deaths after amending their firearms restrictions following a 2010\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0ruling that applied the Second Amendment to the states, researchers found.",
      "Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency room doctor at Massachusetts General Brigham Hospital and the study's lead author, said he started the research after wondering why gun deaths among children were so high. Firearms are the leading cause of death among children and teenagers in the United States, with a\u00a0steep increase\u00a0in ages 15 to 19 starting in 2020.",
      "\"Why did things go so badly in some states?\" Faust asked. He said legal scholars told him to look at\u00a0McDonald v. City of Chicago, which applied the Second Amendment to local jurisdictions.",
      "The Supreme Court held in the landmark case that the Constitution's Second Amendment restrains the government's ability to significantly limit \"the right to keep and bear arms.\" For the first decade of the 21st century, there were very few changes to gun laws but every state changed their laws to some or great extent after McDonald, said Faust.",
      "Researchers divided the 50 states into three groups \u2014 most permissive, permissive, and strict \u2014 based on legal changes made since 2010. The team, which included researchers from Brown University, Yale New Haven, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of California, used a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database to analyze data from the decade before the Supreme Court ruling and then compared that to data from 2011 to 2023.",
      "The findings surprised Faust and his team, he told CBS News.",
      "Youth deaths jumped by 7,398 in the period after the Supreme Court ruling \u2014 with a total of 23,000 gun-related fatalities. Children's deaths by both homicide and suicide also rose in states that had the most permissive firearm laws, the study found. Black youth also saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the most permissive and permissive states.",
      "The CDC found in 2023 that the vast majority of firearm deaths involving young children were\u00a0due to guns\u00a0that were stored unlocked and loaded. But Faust said that while gun storage is an important part of saving lives, the study shows strict laws play an enormous role in preventing youth firearms deaths.",
      "In the states that had the most restrictive laws, deaths remained stable or, in some cases, there were fewer pediatric gun deaths.",
      "California had a 40% reduction in children's gun deaths, the study found. New York, Rhode Island, Maryland and Massachusetts also saw a decrease.",
      "\"This study shows the problem is linked pretty tightly to legal posture. This can be fixed and bring back thousands of people,\" Faust said.\u00a0\"States should ask what they want for their communities? What are they willing to do to save lives?\"",
      "Gun-control advocates like Emma Brown, the executive director of Giffords \u2014 an anti-gun violence group led by former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head in 2011 during a constituent meeting \u2014 applauded the study's findings.",
      "\"Guns are the leading cause of death for kids and young people in the United States, and now more kids are dying because some states prioritize making gun CEOs richer over fighting crime and building safe communities,\" Brown said. \"This study shows what we all know: common sense gun laws save lives.\"",

    "story": [
      "Much like a golf course, Venmo can bring some unexpected traps and other hazards.",
      "The popular payment app enables users to send requests and payments to Venmo accounts listed as public \u2014 a default setting that opened up a can of worms for the world's top golfer, Scottie Scheffler.",
      "Scheffler, 28, who is competing in the U.S. Open this week, said Tuesday that he deleted the app after receiving a string of unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance.",
      "\"That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win. It wasn't a good feeling,\" the 16-time PGA Tour winner recently told reporters, according to CBS Sports.",
      "While he occasionally received small payments after winning a game, Scheffler said he more typically got requests from gamblers looking to cash in if he had lost.",
      "\"I don't remember the most that somebody would send me,\" he said. \"Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.\"",
      "Ordinary Venmo users may not attract the same attention on the app as Scheffler, but they can still benefit from knowing how to protect their privacy on the payment platform.",
      "Read on for tips on how to navigate Venmo safely.",
      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",
      "With the proliferation on online scams, Venmo encourages its users to play it safe. If you get a payment from a stranger, Venmo says you should not accept the transfer, but instead contact the app's\u00a0support team.",
      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",
      "For more information on how to safely use Venmo, the company's\u00a0website\u00a0outlines common mobile payment scams and how to avoid them.",
      "Can everyone see my Venmo payment history?",
      "Paying your roommate for the electricity bill? Others might be able to see that transaction on Venmo, depending on your account settings.",
      "If your profile is public, which is the default setting on the app, then each of your payment transactions will appear on Venmo's main feed, making them visible to anyone online. That includes information on who you're paying, when you paid them and what you're paying them for \u2014 cue the pizza emoji.",
      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction. Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",
      "For example, if your account is private and you're making a payment to someone with a public account, the payment will automatically be private, and only visible to you and the recipient.",

    "summary": "Nearly a dozen of the government's most seasoned lawyers have been relegated to what they refer to as the Justice Dept. rubber room.",
    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration swept into the Department of Justice on Jan. 20, it moved swiftly to purge, demote, transfer and otherwise sideline career lawyers not perceived to be team players or sufficiently committed to the MAGA legal agenda.",
      "Amid the upheaval and exodus of longtime federal prosecutors, one quiet 10th floor office in a remote outpost of the Justice Department has come to symbolize the withering impact of changes at the agency. Those who work there call it \"the rubber room.\"",
      "Inside, nearly a dozen of the government's most seasoned civil rights, environmental and national security lawyers have been reconstituted as members of a newly created group called the Sanctuary Cities task force.",
      "At first glance, the job seemed promising \u2014 a legal strike team that would sue municipalities the administration claimed were facilitating the violation of immigration laws, a task force undertaking a top priority for the new Justice Department leadership.",
      "But the more these attorneys looked into it, the more they concluded the task force was a sham, a Potemkin operation that seemed more aimed at stashing away career lawyers than putting them to work on a legitimate legal project, according to interviews with six people knowledgeable about the task force, all of whom painted a similar picture.",
      "Lawyers there have been assigned menial research tasks and left with hours of idle time \u2014 an effort they view as intended to coerce them into resigning, those with knowledge of the task force said.",
      "\"This is a hard thing to talk about,\" said Tom Mariani, an environmental litigator who resigned rather than accept reassignment to the rubber room. \"I can't tell you how much personal distress I feel over how these folks were treated.\"",
      "The term rubber room is an allusion to now-infamous \"reassignment centers\" where New York City officials transferred public school teachers and administrators who some considered burned out or incompetent, but who could not be fired because of union rules. But in this case, those being transferred have been elite veteran attorneys from the Civil Rights Division, the National Security Division and the Environment and Natural Resources Division whose performance had not previously been questioned.",
      "For months they did little or no work, were cut off from other Justice Department litigators who were actually working on sanctuary city cases and had no supervisors they could turn to for support, those familiar with the assignment told CBS News. At least four of those assigned to the task force have filed formal complaints with the Justice Department's inspector general alleging waste, fraud and abuse, CBS News has learned.",
      "That office declined comment on whether there is an active investigation into the treatment of the task force lawyers.",
      "None would comment for this story, fearing retaliation from the administration. But public interest lawyers and government watchdogs say their experience stands apart as an example of how callously civil servants who have dedicated their professional lives to public service have been treated.",
      "\"For the first time in modern U.S. history, we are witnessing purely vindictive and retaliatory actions being taken against non-partisan civil servants who simply performed their jobs consistent with law and policy during prior time,\" said Mark Zaid, a Washington lawyer who represents government whistleblowers.",
      "A new president, a new assignment: The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group",
      "The emails began arriving in the third week of January from then-Acting Attorney General James McHenry, landing in the inboxes of some of the Justice Department's most senior career attorneys, notifying them that they were being transferred to the newly created Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group and had 15 days to decide whether to take the new assignment or resign.",
      "Among those told they were being transferred to the task force were the two most senior career lawyers in the National Security Division, George Toscas and Eun Young Choi. Toscas, who was one of the most knowledgeable counterterrorism lawyers in the federal government, took personal leave instead of showing up at the task force offices. Choi, a highly experienced cyber and crypto prosecutor, also took personal leave. Both have since left the department.",
      "Mariani, who was the chief of the enforcement section of the Environment and Natural Resources section, was a 40-year veteran of the Justice Department who had reached retirement age. He said he opted to exit rather than take the new assignment.",
      "Those who did accept the assignment arrived in the isolated offices during what some called a Department of Justice in turmoil, former senior prosecutors told CBS News.",
      "Puzzles and streaming shows",
      "In this environment, several people familiar with the matter told CBS News that lawyers assigned to the new sanctuary cities section felt they had few options. They showed up for their first day \u2014 Feb. 12 \u2014 at a satellite building of the Justice Department known informally as 2Con for its address at 2 Constitution Avenue. Their handler was Kendra Wharton, an associate deputy attorney general who had worked on multiple legal cases involving President Trump before joining the department.",
      "Wharton rarely, if ever, showed up at the 10th floor office at 2Con. Some lawyers said they never saw her at the rubber room in the nearly three months they were on the task force.",
      "In the first few weeks, she communicated with the group on video calls to give them their assignments. On Feb. 13, at 9:30 a.m., Wharton called in from Justice Department headquarters while the attorneys gathered around a monitor. According to a source familiar with the call, she asked them to research the sanctuary city policies in several heavily Democratic states. The lawyers asked if they could contact the Civil Division lawyers handling the litigation in those states, but Wharton told them she was to be the single point of contact.",
      "\"A 10th grader could have done it,\" one source familiar with the work remarked bitterly.",
      "Two weeks later, Wharton asked the lawyers to compile information on three additional states. On March 5, Wharton asked for \"emergency\" follow up on a single city, according to one source. A few days later she added one more blue state to the places she wanted studied.",
      "After that, Wharton received a different mandate, and she is no longer supervising the lawyers, a Justice Department official said. Work in the rubber room slowed to a halt.",
      "\"Having worked around the clock for years, if not decades, the imposed idleness was something I could not get used to,\" said one lawyer who was assigned to the task force.",
      "The lawyers continued coming into 2Con each morning but had to find activities to occupy their time. Some completed jigsaw puzzles and streamed television shows like \"The Last of Us\" and \"Succession.\" One lawyer, Deborah Harris, whose previous job had been head of the Environment and Natural Resources Division's crimes section, could be seen practicing Italian on Duolingo.",
      "Reached for comment, Harris confirmed some details about some of the ways she passed her time in the rubber room but declined to say anything more.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said, \"The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group is focused on important work to advance top priorities of this administration.\"",
      "Turmoil inside the Justice Department",
      "The rubber room is just the latest in a series of personnel moves that critics of the administration have tracked. Some have been demoted within their own units. Bruce Swartz, the highly respected head of the Office of International Affairs, was notified by email that he was being transferred to the office's training program, a job that fell several rungs below his position. He opted to resign.",
      "Nearly a dozen prosecutors in the Public Integrity Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York quit rather than sign onto legal actions they objected to \u2014 such as the decision in February to drop the prosecution of New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "And at the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office, the interim top prosecutor fired or demoted dozens of assistant U.S. attorneys who had won convictions against hundreds of rioters who assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Those who did not resign were given jobs typically assigned to junior prosecutors, sometimes referred to as \"baby AUSAs,\" like handling misdemeanors in D.C. Superior Court or working in the office's intake section screening cases for prosecution or alternative action.",
      "Harold Koh, Sterling professor of international law and a former dean of Yale Law School, served in the Justice and State Departments under four presidents from both parties. For him, the rooting out of so many lawyers represents more than the personal devastation of these government professionals \u2014 it would be a loss for the American people for years to come.",
      "\"Apart from the shabby, petty treatment of career government officials and the degradation of government institutions, the greatest injury to the American people is the harm caused by the destruction of preparedness for dealing with the next crisis,\" Koh said of this administration.",
      "\"The best and the brightest have always wanted to go to Justice,\" he added, \"but who would want to go to a place like that now?\"",

    "story": [
      "Israel unleashed airstrikes across Iran for a third day on Sunday and threatened even greater force. Also Sunday, some Iranian missiles evaded Israel's air defenses to strike buildings in the heart of the country. The exchange of fire\u00a0comes as talks on Iran's nuclear program in Oman between the U.S. and Iran were called off.",
      "The simultaneous strikes represented the latest salvo since a surprise attack by Israel three days earlier aimed at decimating Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Iran said Israel struck two oil refineries, raising the prospect of a broader assault on Iran's heavily sanctioned energy industry that could affect global markets.",
      "The Israeli military, in a social media post, warned Iranians to evacuate arms factories, signaling what could be a further widening of the campaign. Around noon local time, explosions were heard again in the Iranian capital, Tehran.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that if the Israeli strikes on Iran stop, then \"our responses will also stop.\" He said the United States \"is a partner in these attacks and must take responsibility.\"",
      "New explosions echoed across Tehran and were reported elsewhere in the country early Sunday. The Washington-based Human Rights Activists group said Sunday that the Israeli strikes in Iran have killed at least 406 people and wounded another 654. The group was working to identify who among the casualties were civilians and who were part of the security services.",
      "Iran's government has not offered overall casualty figures as it struggles with the strikes that have decimated its military leadership and targeted its nuclear sites. Individual officials have offered partial figures.",
      "On Saturday, Iran's U.N. ambassador said 78 people had been killed and more than 320 wounded.",
      "In Israel, at least 10 people were killed in Iranian strikes overnight and into Sunday, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service. It brought the country's total death toll to 13, including a 10-year-old and a 9-year-old in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, since the strikes began on Friday night.",
      "Iran has fired over 270 missiles, 22 of which made impact, according to official Israeli figures.",
      "Israeli strikes targeted Iran's Defense Ministry early Sunday after hitting air defenses, military bases and sites associated with its nuclear program. The killing of several top generals and nuclear scientists in targeted strikes indicated that Israeli intelligence has penetrated Iran at the highest levels.",
      "Israel \u2014 widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East \u2014 has sophisticated multi-tiered air defenses\u00a0that are able to detect and intercept missiles fired at populated areas or key infrastructure, but officials acknowledge it is imperfect.",
      "Israel's defense minister warned Saturday that \"Tehran will burn\" if Iran continues\u00a0firing missiles at Israel.",
      "Speaking after an assessment meeting with the army's chief of staff, Defense Minister Israel Katz said Iran will pay a heavy price for harming Israeli citizens. At least three people have died in Israel, and dozens were wounded, Israel Defense Forces officials said Saturday morning.",
      "\"If (Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front \u2014 Tehran will burn,\" Katz said.",
      "Following Israel's expanded assault, Katz followed up early Sunday morning with a post that read, \"Tehran is burning.\"",

      "Israel's initial assault used warplanes \u2014 as well as drones smuggled into the country in advance, according to officials \u2014 to hit key facilities and kill top generals and scientists.",
      "\"The individuals who were eliminated played a central part of the progress toward nuclear weapons,\" the IDF said in a news release. \"Their elimination represents a significant blow to the Iranian regime's ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\"",
      "Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook the buildings below. The Israeli military urged civilians, already rattled by 20 months of war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, to head to shelter for hours. U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that U.S. forces helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles on Friday.",
      "Iran calls nuclear talks \"unjustifiable\"",
      "Israel's ongoing strikes have halted \u2014 for now \u2014 diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran. Oman's foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said on social media that talks on Sunday \"will not now take place,\" but he added that \"diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.\"",
      "A senior administration official told CBS News, \"While there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon.\"",
      "Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, said Saturday that the nuclear talks were \"unjustifiable\" after Israel's strikes, which he said were the \"result of the direct support by Washington.\"",
      "President Trump, who has expressed full support for Israel's actions, offered a stark warning to Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets in the Middle East. He also predicted Israel and Iran would \"soon\" make a deal to end their escalating conflict.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social account early Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated that the U.S. was not involved in the attacks on Iran and warned that any retaliation directed against it would bring an American response \"at levels never seen before.\"",
      "\"However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump took to social media again to predict, \"Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal.\"",
      "The president claimed he has built a track record for de-escalating conflicts, and that he would get Israel and Iran to cease hostilities \"just like I got India and Pakistan to make\" after the two countries' recent cross-border confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump also pointed to efforts by his administration during his first term to mediate disputes between Serbia and Kosovo and Egypt and Ethiopia.",
      "\"Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran!\" he wrote. \"Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "One of Mr. Trump's allies in the senate, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning that Mr. Trump \"sent a clear message to the Ayatollahs, that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.\"",
      "Above-ground section of Natanz facility destroyed",
      "Among the key sites Israel attacked was Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.",
      "Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.",
      "U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged the infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency said four \"critical buildings\" were damaged, including its uranium conversion facility. It said there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with official procedures, said that according to the army's initial assessment, \"it will take much more than a few weeks\" for Iran to repair the damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. The official said the army had \"concrete intelligence that production in Isfahan was for military purposes.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation,\" Cotton said Iran is \"close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons,\" and that's why both Mr. Trump and Netanyahu thought \"things were coming to a head\" with Thursday night's launch.",
      "\"A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month,\" Cotton added. \"And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.\"",

    "summary": "Sirens sounded in Israel as Iran launched dozens of ballistic missiles in retaliation for Israel's strikes on its nuclear facilities.",
    "story": [
      "Warning sirens sounded across Israel on Friday as Iran fired dozens of ballistic missiles in a retaliatory attack after Israel launched overnight airstrikes. A second round of missiles targeted Israel a few hours later. Some made it through Israel's missile defense system, causing damage and injuries, though the full extent of the damage is not yet clear.",
      "A little after 4:30 a.m. Saturday local time, the Israel Defense Forces wrote on social media that \"Israelis are currently running for shelter in northern Israel as sirens sound due to another missile launch from Iran.\" It was not immediately clear if this marked a third round of missiles or was still part of the second wave.",
      "In the first round, about 100 missiles were fired from Iran in two salvos, officials said. Israel has a robust missile defense system known as the\u00a0Iron Dome, which intercepted most of the missiles, the IDF said. The IDF reported a limited number of hits on structures, some from interception failures.",
      "Video and photos show a number of buildings damaged or on fire. The IDF reported that 21 people had been injured and two were in serious condition.",
      "Dozens more missiles came in the next wave, and again the IDF said some, but not all, were intercepted. \"Search and Rescue forces are currently operating in a number of locations across the country in which reports of fallen projectiles were received,\" the military said.",
      "A U.S. official and a White House official confirmed to CBS News that the United States helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.",
      "During the strikes, U.S. troops at two bases in the Middle East were ordered into bunkers. Troops at Union III in the Green Zone in Baghdad, Iraq, and Al-Tanf Garrison in Syria spent about an hour in the bunkers, CBS News confirmed.",
      "The retaliatory action from Iran came after Israel launched over 200 airstrikes on Iran, continuing a\u00a0major operation\u00a0that began overnight, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Friday. Israel's airstrikes are continuing, Defrin said.",
      "Iran's U.N. ambassador said Friday that 78 people were killed and more than 320 were injured in Israeli attacks.",
      "Israel first launched airstrikes on Iran early Friday and announced its operation was targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists and senior military commanders.",
      "Tehran responded by launching more than 100 drones at Israel on Friday morning, Israel's military said. Defrin said earlier Friday that Israel's air defenses had worked to \"intercept the threats.\" Later Friday, an Israeli military official told reporters that while the threat wasn't over, Israel had managed to intercept many of Iran's UAVs.",
      "\"Throughout the day, we once again demonstrated our ability to remove threats in a coordinated, precise and daring manner,\" Defrin said Friday night local time.",
      "In a televised statement on Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the Iranian Armed Forces would respond fiercely to the strikes and leave Israel \"helpless.\"",
      "Shortly after the statement, the IDF confirmed that its fighter jets had \"completed a strike on the Iranian regime's nuclear site in the Isfahan area.\" Ishafan is in central Iran. The strike \"dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories and additional infrastructure,\" the IDF said.",
      "U.S. not involved in Israel's strikes, Rubio says",
      "The U.S. was not involved in Israel's strikes, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, adding a warning that \"Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\"",
      "The State Department informed multiple U.S.-allied governments in the region Thursday in advance of the Israeli strikes and intelligence operations in Iran, four sources told CBS News. Rubio personally reached out to a number of them, sources said.",
      "The main message conveyed by the Trump administration in those messages was that this was not a U.S. operation and did not involve U.S. assets, and that the U.S. preferred diplomacy to military force.",
      "President Trump said in a post Friday morning on his Truth Social platform that he had given Iran \"chance after chance\" to make a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but that despite his warnings to Tehran that the alternative would be \"much worse\" than anything seen before, \"they just couldn't get it done.\"",
      "\"There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.\"",
      "In a later post on Friday, Mr. Trump said he \"gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to 'make a deal.' They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!\"",
      "Israel has intercepted virtually every Iranian weapon launched in previous large-scale attacks by the Islamic republic. The retaliatory action by Iran was long anticipated and well planned for, Defrin said.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Friday on Iranian TV that the country would \"strongly take action\" against Israel in response to the attacks, promising \"a severe, wise and strong answer.\"",
      "\"The Iranian nation and the country's officials will not remain silent in the face of this crime, and the legitimate and powerful response of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make the enemy regret its foolish act,\" he said.",
      "Israel says it destroyed Iran's air defenses, killed top commanders",
      "Earlier Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the IDF had begun \"Operation Rising Lion,\" with a massive wave of airstrikes against dozens of Iranian nuclear sites, military commanders and research scientists, saying the goal was to \"roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.\"",
      "Like Netanyahu, Defrin, the IDF spokesman, called the attack on Iran preemptive in a video statement delivered Friday, saying Israeli intelligence had uncovered an Iranian \"plan to destroy Israel that has taken shape in recent years.\" He said that plan involved Iran \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" working to double or triple its ballistic missile stockpile, and continuing to \"finance, arm, and operate its proxies throughout the Middle East against the State of Israel.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that the senior security leadership of the Iranian regime has been eliminated in the strike: the Iranian Chief of Staff, [Mohammad] Bagheri; the Commander of the Revolutionary Guards, [Hossein] Salami; and the Head of the Emergency Command, [Gholamali] Rashid,\" Defrin said, adding that other commanders had been killed and that Israeli would provide further updates. He said Israel had \"targeted and struck the Iranian regime's aerial defense arrays.\"",
      "The IDF said its operation would continue for days, but that the first wave consisted of 200 Israeli fighter jets dropping \"over 330 different munitions,\" to hit more than 100 targets in Iran.",
      "\"The breadth and scale of these strikes \u2014 against senior Iranian officials and other military facilities in addition to nuclear sites \u2014 suggest this operation is intended to not just dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, but also cripple any potential military response and even to destabilize the regime,\" Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, said in a statement.",
      "\"Israel has once again demonstrated its considerable conventional military superiority, and the size of the force allegedly assembled for this series of attacks represents the overwhelming bulk of their longer-range strike aircraft. They have the ability to conduct multiple such rounds of strikes, but operating for an extended duration over this considerable range will stretch even the Israeli Air Force,\" Savill said.",
      "Savill said Iran's response \"might be delayed or split into multiple phases, but their main weapon will be ballistic missiles, which have the best chance of inflicting damage on Israel, whereas drone and cruise missile attacks will face more extensive Israeli defenses. Israel operations have therefore targeted air defenses and ballistic missile sites to forestall this.\"",
      "Savill said that if Iran \"believes the U.S. or others were involved\" in the Israeli strike, then their retaliation could include targeting the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, and American air facilities in Qatar, \"though both would widen the conflict to drag in others.\"",
      "NATO chief urges de-escalation, says nuclear clash \"not close\"",
      "Iranian state media said the Israeli strikes had hit several cities, including in the capital of Tehran and the city of Natanz, a key center for Iran's uranium enrichment program. The IDF said it struck Iran's uranium enrichment site in the Natanz area.",
      "\"The underground area of the site was damaged,\" the IDF said in a statement. \"This area contains a multi-story enrichment hall with centrifuges, electrical rooms, and additional supporting infrastructure. In addition, critical infrastructure enabling the site's continuous operation and the Iranian regime's ongoing efforts to obtain nuclear weapons were targeted.\"",
      "The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said in a series of social media posts that its director-general, Rafael Grossi, had been in contact with Iranian authorities on Friday, who told him the country's highly sensitive and highly secured Fordo nuclear site \"has not been impacted\" by the Israeli strikes. Later Friday, Reuters reported that two explosions had been heard near the site and that state media said Iranian air defenses had shot down an Israeli drone near the facility.",
      "The IAEA also said Iran's \"Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant had not been targeted and that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site.\"",
      "On Friday, during a visit to Sweden, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters that \"this was a unilateral action by Israel. So I think it is crucial for many allies, including the United States, to work as we speak to de-escalate.\"",
      "Despite the ongoing attacks, Rutte said he believed the region was \"not close\" to a possible nuclear conflict.",
      "While there have been no claims that Iran has yet built a nuclear weapon, Israel is believed to have multiple warheads, though it has never formally confirmed nor denied its status as a nuclear-armed nation.",
      "Iranian officials quickly threatened retaliation to the attack, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying Israel \"should await a harsh response.\"",
      "The IDF said in a statement before Iran's retaliatory strikes that it had prepared for \"a campaign on the frontline and on the home front.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel's strikes against Iran, \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\"",
      "Shortly after Israel's strikes, the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place.",
      "A day beforehand, the Trump administration\u00a0ordered\u00a0non-emergency U.S. personnel to leave Iraq and allowed U.S. military family members to leave the Middle East voluntarily.",
      "Risk of an escalating regional conflict",
      "Israel has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in recent years, while Iran has backed foes of Israel, including the militant group Hamas.",
      "In April of last year, Iran\u00a0launched missiles and drones\u00a0at Israel after a strike on Iran's consulate\u00a0in Damascus\u00a0was widely attributed to Israel, but the Israeli military intercepted the vast majority of the weapons.",
      "Six months later, Iran\u00a0launched more\u00a0missiles at Israel, which retaliated with strikes on Iranian sites.",
      "Friday's back-and-forth could escalate to be among the most severe clashes between Israel and Iran, which have been adversaries for decades. Mr. Trump warned earlier in the week that the strikes could snowball into a \"massive\" conflict.",
      "Farea Al-Muslimi, a research fellow at the Chatham House think tank, said in a statement Friday that the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen could play a role in the Iranian response to Israel.",
      "\"With Iran currently weakened and humiliated, this marks the first time the Houthis will be called upon to repay decades of Iranian investment and support,\" Al-Muslimi predicted. \"Following the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis have effectively become Iran's first line of defense against Israel \u2014 an increasingly central role.\"",
      "Al-Muslimi said the Houthi response could extend beyond retaliatory strikes on Israel itself.",
      "\"Strikes in the Red Sea will likely resume, the ceasefire with the United States may unravel, and we shouldn't be surprised if Saudi Arabia and the UAE are dragged back into direct conflict in Yemen,\" Al-Muslimi said. \"Attacks by the Houthis on U.S. military bases in the Gulf, the Horn of Africa, and naval forces at sea are also highly plausible.\"",
      "Fabian Hinz, an air warfare expert at London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, told the Associated Press that Iran's current capabilities are potentially \"more threatening to the U.S. military than to Israel.\"",
      "Iran has a \"huge arsenal\" of shorter-range missiles, Hinz said, and there are a number of U.S. military bases in the region. He said Iran also has \"lots of anti-ship capabilities.\"",
      "\"Think of the Iranian shipping threat as similar in quality to the Houthi threat, but much larger in quantity,\" Hinz told the AP.",
      "Israeli attack casts doubt on fate of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks",
      "The Israeli strikes and Iranian counterattack came amid efforts by President Trump to strike a new deal with Iran to limit the country's nuclear ambitions \u2014 an idea Israel has long been dubious of.",
      "The U.S. and Iran were set to hold talks Sunday, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. There was no immediate comment from any high-ranking Iranian officials that those plans would change after Israel's attack, but some reports in Iranian media outlets indicated Iran would likely no longer participate in the negotiations.",
      "\"With Israel's actions, the sixth round of negotiations with the United States will probably not be held,\" Iranian lawmaker Aladdin Boroujerdi, a member of parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, said, according to Iranian media.",

      "The seat is on the left side of the aircraft when facing the cockpit. The man, 40-year-old British national\u00a0Viswash Kumar Ramesh, said the plane crash-landed on the ground floor of a building where medical students lived.

Effie Defrin claimed intelligence showed \"the Iranian regime has made significant progress in achieving nuclear capability and its ability to act against us,\" calling it an emerging and existential threat to Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was not involved in Israel's airstrikes on Iran.",
      "The attacks came one day after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more advanced ones.",
      "The IAEA is the United Nations' Vienna-based nuclear watchdog. It said in a confidential report last month that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, and called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency's probe.",

The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Steve Witkoff, the president's Middle East envoy, was set to hold a sixth round of talks with Iran in the Gulf state of Oman on Sunday.",
      "Here's a look at some major Iranian sites and their importance in Tehran's program.",
      "Natanz enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 135 miles southeast of Tehran, is the country's main enrichment site.",
      "Part of the facility on Iran's Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium.",
      "Iran also is burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz's southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate sabotage attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.",
      "In\u00a0testimony Friday before the U.N.\u00a0about Israel's strikes, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Iran confirmed that its Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant had been attacked. He said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% had \"been destroyed\" and centrifuges may have been damaged. He said Iranian authorities also reported attacks on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and Esfahan site.",
      "Fordo enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 60 miles southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn't as big a facility as Natanz.",
      "Buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries,\u00a0Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the IAEA, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.",
      "Bushehr nuclear power plant",
      "Iran's only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr\u00a0on the Persian Gulf, some 465 miles south of Tehran. Construction on the plant began under Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.",
      "Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the IAEA.",
      "Arak heavy water reactor",
      "The Arak heavy water reactor\u00a0is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",
      "The U.S. withdrew from the international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018, and Iran partially withdrew in 2019.",
      "Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center",
      "The facility in Isfahan, some 215 miles southeast of Tehran, employs thousands of nuclear scientists. It also is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country's atomic program.",
      "Tehran Research Reactor",
      "The Tehran Research Reactor is at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the civilian body overseeing the country's atomic program.

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

      "Judge\u00a0Arun Subramanian is considering dismissing a juror from Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' trial.",
      "On Friday, both parties and the judge had a long discussion about whether the juror, who gave conflicting answers about where he lives, should be let go.",
      "The prosecution said the juror disclosed that he recently moved to New Jersey with his girlfriend and has been staying there for most of the trial. When he was questioned behind closed doors, the juror said he was staying in New York 4\u20135 nights. He also said the daughter was born in NJ and lives there, but he lives in NYC.",
      "The government pointed out that during voir dire he said he lived in the Bronx with his fianc\u00e9 and daughter.",
      "Judge\u00a0Subramanian noted that there were several inconsistencies in the juror's statements and either the juror was unable to follow simple instructions and answer the questions or there was deceit. He agreed that there are \"serious questions\" about the juror\u2019s candor given the discrepancies in the record.",

      "The judge told the parties that if there is a concern about integrity, that\u2019s why the court has alternate jurors. The judge said \"removal of the juror is required\" and dismissed him.",
      "However, despite the judge's initial ruling, Diddy's defense lawyer, Xavier Donaldson, argued that these answers are not as significant and might have a \"chilling effect.\" Donaldson argued that people have relatives and girlfriends in New Jersey, and he thinks the juror should be allowed to explain the inconsistencies. He also argued that if the juror was removed, it would be a less diverse jury.",
      "Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo noted that the defendant, Diddy, has the right to a jury of \"his choosing.\"",
      "The judge noted that the issue is why there were inconsistencies and if there was an effort to shade responses to stay on the jury, that there was an agenda. Judge\u00a0Subramanian told the defense he would think about their arguments over the weekend and let the parties know if anything changes.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was seen at the defense table wearing a caramel-crown sweater on Friday, June 13. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Earlier in the day, Diddy's former personal assistant, Jonathan Perez, took the stand. The prosecution's Madison Smyser asked him about the rapper's \"king nights,\" which have also been referred to throughout the trial as \"hotel nights\" and \"freak-offs.\"",
      "Perez claimed he would help set up the room with personal items, including: food, oil, lube, honey and the lights set to red.",
      "Smyser showed the court evidence of boxes of astroglide that were stored at Diddy's L.A. home. Perez testified that he would clean up after the \"king nights\" and collect all items that were left behind. He also told the jury he would put the room back together before the hotel staff would clean the room.",
      "Perez noted that these nights could last anywhere from 12 hours to a full day. He said participants would appear tired after the evening and Diddy and his guest would get a drip or an IV.",
      "Diddy's ex-assistant testified that drugs were part of the rapper's personal life. Here is an exhibit of a Gucci bag full of drugs allegedly beloning to Combs. (SDNY)",
      "Text exchanges were presented to the court, showing Perez sharing the hotel room number with Diddy and sending pictures of lingerie options to the rapper's former chief of staff, Kristina \"KK\" Khorram \u2013 who would forward them to Diddy and his ex-girlfriend, who testified under the alias Jane.",
      "One of Diddy's lawyers, Brian Steel, began cross-examination of Perez and asked him if \"king nights\" were personal to the rapper. Perez agreed, claiming that those nights and taking drugs were aspects of Diddy's personal life.",
      "Perez confirmed he would buy lingerie, shoes, and dresses for Jane to \"look good\" for Diddy. Steel then asked Perez if he ever felt that Jane was \"hesitant\" to participate in a \"king night,\" to which Perez said no.",
      "Brian Steel, attorney for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, arrived to court on May 29. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)",
      "Perez testified that Diddy never told him to lie or obstruct anything when it came to \"king nights.\"",
      "Earlier in court on Friday, Diddy's defense team complained about the secrecy of certain aspects of the trial, including a famous rapper being mentioned \u2014 but not named \u2014 during testimony.",
      "Before the 55-year-old music mogul's trial resumed on Thursday, lawyers representing Combs and federal prosecutors engaged in a back and forth about naming individuals who were present with Combs' ex-girlfriend Jane during a Las Vegas night that took place in January 2024. However, this was done behind closed doors and even Combs himself was not present.",
      "Once all parties were back in the courtroom, defense attorney Agnifilo complained to Judge\u00a0Subramanian about the fact that Combs was excluded from the meeting.",
      "Agnifilo emphasized the public nature of trials and wanted his objection on the record, adding that what they \"didn't consent to, and we don't, most respectfully, is that these events which play important parts in the background of some of the most critical events in the trial, should be in any way not fully public.\"",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs allegedly ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, the government claimed. (Getty Images)",
      "\"Part of the reason that trials are fully public is so if other people realize they know something about an event discussed in a public courtroom they can come forward and share their recollection about it,\" Agnifilo stated. \"And I think that is kind of the practical side of the constitutional right to a public trial; that it's public for a reason, and the facts are public for a reason, and the names are public for a reason. And that reason is so the public can do what the public does in all issues of importance, which is receive them, and if someone has something to add, that person can come forward and add whatever it is that person has to add.\"",
      "The prosecution argued the defense's suggestion regarding the use of real names was \"nothing more than a pretense to attempt to harass and intimidate\" Combs' ex-girlfriend, who testified this week under the pseudonym Jane.",
      "During her testimony, Jane told the jury about a secret Las Vegas trip she took in January 2024. Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend noted she traveled to see a very famous rapper who is close to Combs.",
      "The rapper is \"an icon in the music industry,\" according to Jane.",
      "Jane recalled that she and others attended a play before heading to a strip club, and then they went to a hotel room. Antoine \u2014 one of the male escorts Jane and Combs often turned to for alleged \"hotel nights\" \u2014 was part of the group. Jane said that she and Antoine greeted each other.",
      "Jane recalled watching Antoine have sex with a woman in front of others after she went to the hotel room. She told Combs\u2019 defense lawyer there was flirtatious banter between her and the rapper, but nothing happened between them.",
      "The prosecution and the defense engaged in a back and forth in court on Thursday. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "In late May, the defense had previously objected to Combs' former assistant \"Mia\" testifying under the pseudonym when she took the stand.",
      "On Thursday, Subramanian told both legal teams that his ruling had not changed.",
      "\"The idea that somehow public revelation of the details that we discussed would in any way\u2026 result in some kind of investigation that would bear on the actual charges raised is not a real concern,\" the judge said.",
      "Before the 55-year-old rapper's trial resumed on Thursday, lawyers representing Sean Combs and federal prosecutors engaged in a back and forth about naming individuals who were present at a \"hotel night\" that took place on Jan. 24, 2024. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Prosecutor Maurene Comey added, \"I will also note that the identity of the people who were on that particular event is not a defense to any of the conduct that Jane testified the defendant engaged in on June 18 and 19 of 2024. So it is extreme \u2014 its probative value is extremely minimal and has nothing to do, from our perspective certainly, with the defendant's guilt or innocence of the sex trafficking charges.\"",
      "Criminal defense attorney John W. Day, owner of the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based law practice John Day Law, agreed, telling Fox News Digital, \"The judge is right \u2014 there's no reason other than intimidation for trying to publicize the names of other people present at \u2018hotel nights,\u2019 since this is not part of any charged conduct. The defense's claim, that naming names will bring other witnesses out of the woodwork, ignores that anyone who would be a potential witness has been following this trial from the start.\"",

Once home, she claimed the fight between her and Combs continued. As the fight turned physical, Jane recalled Combs punching her twice.

      "COMMON AGING SYMPTOM COULD WORSEN LONELINESS IN SENIORS",

      "1. \u00a0Limit exposure to loud noises",
      "Whether it's a crowded concert, heavy traffic or the constant hum of power tools, repeated exposure to high noise levels is known to cause permanent damage to the delicate structures in the inner ear.",
      "One of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to these loud environments, the NIH states.",
      "Making small changes now can help protect your ears and hearing later in life, experts advise. (iStock)",
      "Even small adjustments, such as lowering the volume on your headphones or taking quiet breaks during a noisy event, can make a big difference over time.",

      "Damage to the inner ear can happen long before it shows up on a hearing test, according to the NIH, which means prevention is key.",
      "When loud situations are unavoidable, and you expect to be exposed for more than a few minutes, experts recommend wearing ear protection, such as foam earplugs or noise-canceling earmuffs.",
      "One of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to loud environments.",

      "Although hearing loss is common with age, it\u2019s not the only auditory issue.",
      "According to the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), conditions like tinnitus, which often peaks between ages 60 and 69, can also develop. Tinnitus causes persistent sounds such as ringing, hissing, buzzing or whooshing in the ears.",

      "Whelan said a significant legal fight could be brewing over the provision of Title 10 that Trump used to federalize the National Guard. Typically, presidents deploy National Guard members with a governor's consent, but the law leaves room for debate on whether the governor's permission is required. Whelan speculated that Trump could attempt to use another provision of Title 10, the Insurrection Act, to bypass the court proceedings.",

      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",

      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains.

      "The good news is that you can take steps to reduce the risks and keep your address private. However, keep in mind that data brokers and people search sites can re-list your information after some time, so you might need to request data removal periodically.",
      "I recommend a few ways to\u00a0delete your private information, including your home address, from such websites.",
      "1. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0Data brokers can sell your home address and other personal data to multiple businesses and individuals, so the key is to act fast. If you\u2019re looking for an easier way to protect your privacy, a data removal service can do the heavy lifting for you, automatically requesting data removal from brokers and tracking compliance.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "2. Opt out manually : Use a free scanner provided by a data removal service to check which people search sites that list your address. Then, visit each of these websites and look for an opt-out procedure or form: keywords like \"opt out,\" \"delete my information,\" etc., point the way.",
      "Follow each site\u2019s opt-out process carefully, and confirm they\u2019ve removed all your personal info, otherwise, it may get relisted.",
      "3. Monitor your digital footprint:\u00a0I recommend regularly searching online for your name to see if your location is publicly available. If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.",

      "2. Use alias email addresses",
      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach.

Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",

      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available.

      "How the Atom Touch prosthetic arm uses AI and muscle signals",
      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",
      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",

      "Atom Touch stands out for several reasons. It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

Jason Morris, who lost his arm due to a work accident and is Atom Bodies' lead test user, notes that most prosthetics can only be worn for about two hours due to discomfort. Atom Touch is designed for initial wear of four to six hours, with the goal of achieving all-day use.

When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",

Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device.

      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time.

      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) just announced a major update. Starting this summer, Americans with a\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account will be able to access their digital Social Security number (SSN) online. The goal is to simplify access, reduce paper card replacements and improve data protection.",

Many of them were issued before 1983 and lack basic security features, making them easier to forge or misuse.Rising identity theft risks: Your SSN is one of the most sensitive identifiers tied to your name. When cards are lost, stolen or handled carelessly, it creates opportunities for identity theft, fraud and account takeovers.Demand for digital access: More Americans now expect to access government services from their phones or computers. Long lines at SSA offices and delays in mail processing have made it harder for people to get help quickly. A digital SSN provides faster, safer and more convenient access to your number when you need it.",

      "1) Visit the SSA\u2019s account portal: Go to\u00a0ssa.gov/myaccount and click \"Create an Account.\"",
      "2) Verify your identity: You\u2019ll be asked to provide your name, birthdate, SSN and address. The SSA may use a third-party identity verification service and ask questions based on your credit report.",
      "3) Choose a username and password: Use a strong, unique password and set up two-factor authentication with your phone number or an authenticator app. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

      "1) Use a strong password for your SSA account: Create a unique, complex password for your\u00a0\"My Social Security\"\u00a0account and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication.

Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing your SSN: If you're checking your SSA account, avoid doing so over unsecured networks like\u00a0public Wi-Fi. Use a secure home network or\u00a0VPN to encrypt your connection and protect your session from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing scams and use strong antivirus software: Scammers often pose as the SSA to trick you into revealing your SSN. Don\u2019t click links in unsolicited emails or texts and never give personal information unless you\u2019re sure the source is legitimate. Always go directly to\u00a0ssa.gov if in doubt.",

      "4) Monitor your credit and bank accounts and use an identity theft service: Staying on top of your financial activity is one of the most effective ways to catch identity theft early. That\u2019s where identity protection services come in. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A man looking over his Social Security information (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5) Check your credit reports: Make it a habit to review your credit reports regularly. Look for unfamiliar accounts, unauthorized inquiries or incorrect personal information. If something seems off, contact the credit bureau right away to dispute it.",
      "6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an\u00a0Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.",
      "7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Starting this summer, the SSA will let you view your Social Security number online through your \"My Social Security\" account. It\u2019s a secure, convenient update that cuts down on lost cards and office visits. To use it safely, set up strong login credentials and two-factor authentication.

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

Each jetpack is made to order, handcrafted and painted in the U.K. The\u00a02025 package starts at around $31,000, which is a jump from the original price, but it now includes a two-year warranty, a luxury hard case and a fast charger. For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

      "Since each CudaJet is made to order, buyers should expect a personalized experience. The process involves custom-fitting the harness to your size and selecting your preferred finish, all of which are handcrafted in the U.K. Due to this approach, there is typically a wait time before delivery, which varies depending on demand and the customization options. This ensures you receive a truly unique jetpack tailored just for you.",

Now it's no longer just a clever idea; it's a real way to zip around underwater and see the ocean from a fresh perspective. With the longer battery life, lighter design and smart safety features, this jetpack is definitely for anyone looking to make their underwater adventures more exciting.

      "The brothers pleaded not guilty to all counts, bringing the total to 10 charges against them.",
      "\"The federal charges in the indictment against Alon, Oren, and Tal Alexander are serious because they involve sex trafficking and aggravated sexual abuse,\" Kelly Hyman, a trial attorney and host of the true-crime podcast \"Unresolved: The Diddy Cases,\" told Fox News Digital. \"Since the charges are brought at the federal level, there can be more severe penalties compared to state level crimes.\"",

      "\"In sex trafficking cases, deception, drugs, and false pretenses, like promises of luxury travel, could be considered important facts if it goes to the force, fraud or coercion of the sex trafficking,\" Hyman said. \"And thus could have legal weight to prove a case as the prosecution has the burden to prove the charges against a defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. It is ultimately up to the jury as they are the trier of facts, and the jury will decide what weight to give these facts based on the evidence presented.\"",

      "\"When prosecuting a sex trafficking case in federal court, prosecutors must demonstrate that \u2018force, threats of force, fraud or coercion\u2019 were used to compel the victim to engage in a sex act,\" Hyman told Fox News Digital. \"However, if the victim is a minor, this specific proof is not required.

      "Israel\u2019s overnight strike on Iran was not only one of the most ambitious aerial campaigns in recent history, it was the result of years of covert planning, surveillance and infiltration by Israeli intelligence.",
      "While dozens of fighter jets bombed nuclear and military targets across Iran early Friday morning, the groundwork had long been laid by Mossad agents working in lockstep with the Israeli military.",
      "Code-named \"Am Kelavi\" (Rising Lion), the preemptive operation was the product of unprecedented coordination between the Israeli air force, the Military Intelligence Directorate, Mossad and the country\u2019s defense industries. For years, they worked \"shoulder to shoulder\" to gather the intelligence files needed to eliminate Iran\u2019s most sensitive military and nuclear assets.",
      "ISRAEL SAYS IT TRICKED IRANIAN AIR FORCE LEADERS INTO MEETING BEFORE DEADLY STRIKES",
      "A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital, \"The Mossad worked with a huge number of people\u2014a mass of agents deep inside Iran, operating at the highest level of penetration imaginable. Some of these agents were retrained as commando fighters to carry out mission-critical operations.\"",
      "That work culminated in what the official described as a three-layered strike. \"We eliminated vast areas of Iran\u2019s surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missile infrastructure, a massive number of senior scientists, and large portions of their air defense systems.\"",
      "\"We established a drone base inside Iran, and at zero hour, Mossad operatives retrieved them from hiding spots. We placed precision missiles on numerous vehicles and embedded additional missiles throughout the country, hidden inside rocks. We activated this entire array in precise coordination with the Israeli air force.\"",
      "Israeli jets launched simultaneous strikes on dozens of sites, including Iran\u2019s primary uranium enrichment facility at Natanz. Located 1,500 kilometers from Israeli territory, Natanz had long been a critical part of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson, described it as an underground compound containing multi-level centrifuge halls and electrical infrastructure.",

      "Avner Golov, vice president of the Mind Israel think tank, told Fox News Digital, \"The biggest success was hitting the Natanz facility and neutralizing Iran\u2019s first wave of retaliation\u2014the automatic response.",

      "\"We took out their opening move\u2014the ballistic missiles that were meant to launch immediately, and the drones that were already on the way. The fact that scientists were eliminated\u2014that\u2019s the true achievement.\"",
      "However, far beyond the airstrikes, Israeli sources revealed that a massive intelligence and sabotage campaign was unfolding in parallel inside Iran. A former senior Israeli official told Fox News Digital, \"There was activity inside Iran\u2014an insane level of intelligence work.",
      "\"They located the entire command center of the Iranian Air Force. All the commanders were together, and they were taken out in real time.\"",

      "According to the same official, Iran\u2019s military had gathered its top air force brass in one facility as part of a publicized drill meant to project deterrence. Instead, it exposed them. \"It was partly luck, but also planned\u2014the ability to see them in real time and strike with precision,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a reminder of what happened in Lebanon\u2014taking out contaminated leadership with surgical intelligence.\"",
      "That operation in Lebanon, often referred to as the \"pagers\" operation, saw Israel infiltrate and sabotage Hezbollah\u2019s command network using Chinese-made radios embedded with explosives. The current operation, Israeli experts say, was broader, deeper, and more strategically impactful.",
      "\"I think this is so much more substantial,\" said Nadav Eyal, an Israeli journalist and analyst for \"Yediot Ahronot\" newspaper. \"What was done here was much more than the James Bond kind of type of pagers operation. It\u2019s more about the infrastructure, intelligence needed to read devastating strikes on military installations, and the ingenuity of its intelligence services\u2014electronic surveillance, things that it\u2019s been developing for many years now.\"",
      "The Mossad\u2019s infiltration campaign involved the quiet smuggling of sophisticated weaponry into Iran, hidden inside vehicles and embedded near strategic targets. In central Iran, precision-guided weapons were planted near surface-to-air missile batteries and launched on command. Disguised vehicles were also used to destroy Iran\u2019s air defense systems at the moment of the strike. Meanwhile, explosive drones positioned near Tehran were activated to destroy long-range missile launchers at the Esfajabad base.",
      "All of it took place under the watch of Iranian intelligence and succeeded without detection.",

      "An unprovoked Hamas attack on Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) workers left at least eight people dead and many others injured, as the U.S.-backed organization fears some team members may have been taken hostage.",
      "\"We carefully considered closing our sites today given the heightened security risks and safety concerns, but we decided that the best response to Hamas\u2019 cowardly murderers was to keep delivering food for the people of Gaza who are counting on us. We will not be deterred from our mission towards providing food security for the Palestinian people in Gaza,\" GHF interim Executive Director John Acree said in a statement.",

      "PEOPLE IN GAZA ARE THANKING TRUMP FOR AID, LEADER OF US-BACKED GROUP SAYS",
      "\"Last night\u2019s ambush was a ruthless assault on those who represent the very best of humanity. These were local aid workers \u2013 our colleagues \u2013 risking their lives to bring food to those who are starving. They weren\u2019t combatants. They had no political affiliations. They were there to serve their own people, and they were hunted down by Hamas,\" GHF Executive Chairman Rev. Johnnie Moore told Fox News Digital. \"We are heartbroken, but we\u2019re not backing down. We call on the international community to condemn this unprovoked, barbaric attack and start standing with those of us who are doing the work on the ground. We cannot do it alone. All we want to do is feed people. That\u2019s all.\"",
      "In an earlier statement on the attack, GHF said that \"for days\" Hamas had been threatening its team and aid workers, as well as civilians who receive aid from the organization. In the same statement, GHF called on the international community to condemn Hamas.",
      "\"Tonight, the world must see this for what it is: an attack on humanity. We call on the international community to immediately condemn Hamas for this unprovoked attack and continued threat against our people simply trying to feed the Palestinian people,\" GHF\u2019s statement read.",

      "Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Oren Marmorstein posted about the attack on X and asked whether the United Nations would condemn it.",
      "\"Attacks on civilians in Gaza \u2013 including the killing and injury of hungry people seeking food and those delivering it \u2013 are unacceptable. These incidents have concentrated around the newly established militarized distribution centers, where starving people tell us that Israeli forces opened fire on them,\" \u00a0U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Spokesperson Eri Kaneko told Fox News Digital.",
      "The spokesperson, quoting the Hamas-run agency, said that,\"According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, hospitals have received more than 200 fatalities and over 2,000 injuries from these areas over the past two weeks. Yesterday, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation stated that Palestinians involved in their distributions were killed, injured and captured by Hamas. Lifesaving aid must not be weaponized or obstructed. It must reach people in need \u2013 rapidly, at scale, and in line with humanitarian principles.\"",
      "The United Nations and GHF have been at odds as the international body criticized the U.S.- and Israeli-backed organization and doubted its ability to bring aid to the people of Gaza. In May, Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon accused the U.N. of removing NGOs from a shared aid database after the groups defied a call by the international body to boycott GHF.",

      "\"The UN \u2013 worse, much worse, than silence they continue their vicious slander against our mission. A mission with one goal: FEED GAZA! The principle of impartiality does not mean neutrality. There is good and evil in this world. What we are doing is good and what Hamas did to these Gazans is absolute evil,\" Moore wrote in a post on X.",
      "\"I am sorry it has come to this but again we extend our hand to UN, the WFP, the ICRC, the EU, the GCC, and the world \u2013 join us. \u00a0We can do this together. Or for God\u2019s sake, for the sake of humanity, if you\u2019re not going to join us at least have the courage to boycott HAMAS, not us.\"",
      "Since the launch of its operations late last month, GHF has reportedly distributed approximately 18,647,662 meals via roughly 316,320 boxes. Moore recently told Fox News Digital that Palestinians who have received aid from GHF have been thanking the U.S. and President Donald Trump for the assistance.",

      "As a massive manhunt for Vance Boelter continues, authorities are piecing together a profile of the alleged gunman accused of killing a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another in two separate \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d shootings on Saturday morning.",
      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman of Brooklyn Park and her husband, Mark, were killed in one shooting, and State Sen. John Hoffman of Champlin and his wife, Yvette, were severely injured in another. Hoffman and his wife remain hospitalized.",
      "Follow along for live updates",
      "Officials say Boelter impersonated law enforcement in order to gain access to the lawmakers' homes. Photos, believed to be of Boelter, show a man at one of the victim\u2019s doors wearing a long-sleeve shirt and what looks like a bulletproof vest similar to those worn by law enforcement. Another photo shows a man wearing a cowboy hat walking alone.",
      "Authorities found what they believe is his vehicle and cowboy hat in Sibley County, where an emergency alert has been issued for residents in the area to keep their doors locked and cars secured, NBC affiliate KARE 11 reported.",
      "Law enforcement, including Minnesota state troopers, set up a staging area Sunday about three miles away from Boelter's Green Isle home. Video showed armed state troopers in the area.",
      "He's married with five children",
      "Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson identified 57-year-old Boelter as the suspect in the shootings, describing him as 6-foot-1 with brown hair, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat and a dark long-sleeve collared shirt or coat. Jacobson urged the public not to approach Boelter if they see him, adding that he is \"armed and dangerous.\" During a press briefing Saturday Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the shootings were \"politically motivated.\"",
      "According to a video circulating online, Boelter is married and a father of five children. His wife, who has not been identified, was stopped by the Mille Lacs County Sheriff's Office Saturday morning in Onamia, Minnesota as part of a perimeter stop. There were \"several other relatives,\" in the car, according to the sheriff's office and no one in the vehicle was questioned or searched.",
      "He worked in Africa",
      "In a 2022 video posted to Facebook and verified by NBC News, Minnesota Africans United featured a person introduced as Vance Boelter during a discussion about trade and investment opportunities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As a keynote presenter, Boelter said he was calling from the DRC, and spoke about his work partnering with farmers and fishermen in the country to help them stimulate their food supply system.",
      "In a statement shared with NBC News, a spokesperson for Minnesota Africans United said \" there is no connection between Minnesota Africans United and the individual who carried out the assassinations and attacks\" on Hortman, Hoffman and their spouses.",
      "On his LinkedIn profile, Boelter listed himself as the CEO for Red Lion Group, although he also marked himself as \"open to work.\" It is not immediately clear what Red Lion Group is, but in a post from two years ago, he wrote that he was in the DRC \"working on several projects,\" and that the company \"had a great meeting with the new Governor of Congo Central to talk about our private business projects.\"",
      "Boelter was also listed as the Director of Security Patrols for a Minnesota-based company called Praetorian Guard Security Service, according to a biography posted on the company's website. In the bio, Boelter is said to have \"been involved with security situations in Eastern Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East, including the West Bank, Southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.",
      "In a LinkedIn post from six years ago, Boelter encouraged people to vote in the presidential election.",
      "\"I have been in several countries where people don't have the ability to vote for who their leaders are,\" Boelter wrote in the post. \"So I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America.\"",
      "He spoke at church sermons",
      "Boelter delivered church sermons in the DRC in 2021, 2022 and 2023, according to live streams posted to Facebook authenticated by NBC News. In a 2021 speech, he began with a prayer and then spoke about his path to becoming a better Christian.",
      "Boelter recounted working in a vegetable-canning factory at age 17 with a coworker who \"talked about God all the time,\"  ultimately inspiring him to take his religion more seriously.",
      "At one point during his testimony, Boelter dropped to his knees as he described the moment he dedicated his life to Jesus.",
      "\"And I said 'I'm so sorry, forgive me God, for living for myself, and not for you,'\" he said. \"And I said 'Jesus, if you forgive me of my sin and save me, I'll live for you for the rest of my life.'\"",
      "He worked for two funeral homes",
      "In a resume-style video circulating online, Boelter introduces himself as a married father of five from Green Isle, Minnesota, who works for two funeral homes, Wulff Funeral Home and Metro First Call, handling what he called \"removals.\"",
      "\u201cFun fact about myself, I\u2019ve been in the food industry about 30 years and that led to an opportunity. I was invited to the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d he said in the video, adding that he worked with Del Monte Foods and Minnesota-based chicken producer Gold\u2019n Plump.",
      "Boelter explained he left the food industry because his company \u201cwasn\u2019t interested in doing anything in Africa.\u201d Boelter said he then transitioned to the funeral home business while pursuing projects in Africa on his own.",
      "Boelter mentioned in the video that he was taking a course to learn more about the funeral industry, indicating it may have been taped for the class. The timing of the video, recorded using screen-recording software Screenpal, remains unclear.",
      "In a statement, Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter worked for the company from August 2023 until he \"voluntarily left\" in February of this year.",

      "The roommate said he received a final message from Boelter around 6 a.m. Saturday in which he said he \"may be dead shortly.\"",
      "\"So, I just want to let you know that I love you guys both, and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way,\" the text, read by Boelter's tearful roommate, read. \"I don\u2019t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way, because you guys don\u2019t know anything about this. But I love you guys, and I\u2019m sorry for all the trouble this has caused.\"",
      "It is not clear at this time whether the roommate lived with Boelter and his family, or if Boelter had been living separately from his family with the roommate.",
      "Anyone who sees Boelter is encouraged to call 911. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to Boelter\u2019s arrest."

      "Dozens of prospective employees, many of them Spanish speakers, had been coming in and out of the plant all day. Some were hoping to land a new job; others were coming in for training.",
      "The scene gave the company\u2019s president, Chad Hartmann, a glimmer of hope amid the chaos that ensued after Tuesday's raid purged roughly half of his staff \u2014 many of whom had been longtime employees of the company, which has been processing boxed beef for more than 15 years.",
      "Hartmann had never seen or experienced a raid before. He is finding out in real time that \u201cthere\u2019s no playbook\u201d on how to move forward after one, Hartmann told NBC News.",
      "The process of re-hiring new workers, Hartmann said, feels like asking someone to replace a family member. \u201cYou cannot, in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were part of our family, and they were taken away.\u201d",
      "Seventy-six people working at Glenn Valley Foods were arrested by federal immigration authorities Tuesday morning, the Department of Homeland Security told NBC News in an email.",

      "Grant Hardin\u2019s escape from the North Central Unit in Calico Rock last month involved detailed planning, perfect timing, and a makeshift outfit designed to mimic a law enforcement uniform. Hundreds of state, local and federal agents swarmed the small town, battling severe weather and rugged terrain to search for the man known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "After nearly two weeks on the run, he was found near an Izard County creek \u2014 about 1.5 miles west of the prison.",
      "The brazen prison break, which occurred a little more than a week after 10 inmates escaped a New Orleans jail,  exposed a security lapse at the facility that houses about 800 inmates. But  Hardin, who was described as a model inmate who never caused trouble, ultimately escaped because of one employee\u2019s error.",
      "\u201cThis was not an instance where there wasn\u2019t proper protocol or proper policy,\u201d Arkansas Department of Corrections board member William \u201cDubs\u201d Byers said in an interview. \u201cIt was a matter of the protocol not being followed.

      "Urgent manhunt for \u2018Devil in the Ozarks\u2019",
      "It was just before 3 p.m. on May 25 when Hardin, disguised in a black T-shirt, black pants and a black baseball cap, strolled across the prison grounds. He was wheeling a cart carrying a box and wooden pallets.",
      "Byers said employees swipe their badges to exit the prison\u2019s front gate. Hardin left through a back sally port gate, which is typically used for vehicle traffic.",
      "The officer on duty was in a control tower and, based on preliminary information, assumed Hardin was an employee.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t pay close enough attention. He just thought that the person walking up was an officer because he looked like an officer,\u201d Byers said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk to him, he didn\u2019t question him, he didn\u2019t check him closely. He just opened the gate and assumed that he was an officer taking some things outside the fence.\u201d",
      "About 20 minutes had passed before a routine head count revealed that Hardin was missing. By then, he was long gone.",
      "Brian Scheerer, owner of Calico Cold Creek Manor, said people were on edge as law enforcement set up a perimeter around the prison.",
      "\u201cYou could tell that there was certainly a different vibe in the air. The streets were all closed where they were stopping just about everybody. They weren\u2019t taking any chances,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "His manor, which he rents out during the summer, is about four miles from the prison.",
      "\u201cPeople were hunkering in, even myself,\u201d Scheerer said. \u201cWhere my property is, it\u2019s very secluded. When I went to check my place after renters, I was very cautious.\"",
      "Prison break opens old wounds for victims",
      "Hardin was in prison for fatally shooting Gateway, Arkansas, city water employee James Appleton, and sexually assaulting teacher Amy Harrison. Both cases were featured in the Max documentary \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "According to an affidavit filed in the case, a passerby was driving home from work on Feb. 23, 2017, when he saw Appleton\u2019s truck stopped on the side of the road. Appleton was on the phone with his brother-in-law, then Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, and had pulled over so he would not lose the connection.",
      "Hardin\u2019s white car was stopped behind the truck, the passerby told police. After driving about a few hundred yards up the road, the passerby said he heard a loud bang and saw Hardin\u2019s car driving quickly up the street and turn down a dirt road, the affidavit states. The passerby turned around to check on Appleton and found him dead in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "Hardin, the former police chief of Gateway, was arrested that night as he returned home from having dinner with his wife and daughter. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the crime.",
      "DNA taken after his arrest linked him to the Nov. 9, 1997, sexual assault of Harrison at Frank Tillery Elementary School.",

      "Harrison told police she left her classroom and went to the lounge to use the restroom. When she came out, she said a man was standing in front of the door, pointing a gun at her. The affidavit states that she said she was sexually assaulted in the bathroom and then forced to move to a classroom, where she was raped.",
      "Hardin asked if she was going to tell anyone and then left the room, according to the affidavit. She found a janitor and had him call 911.",
      "Harrison declined to comment to NBC News. Appleton\u2019s sister, Gateway Mayor Cheryl Tillman, did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday. She previously told NBC News that Hardin\u2019s escape brought back \u201ca lot of memories of when it first happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat were they doing down at the prison that this happened?\u201d she said.",
      "Hardin \u2018didn\u2019t put up a fight once apprehended\u2019",
      "An investigation is being conducted to learn how he planned his escape. Byers said Hardin was a model inmate at the facility and believes he used that to his advantage.",
      "Hardin worked in the kitchen and never got in trouble while incarcerated, Byers said.",
      "\u201cThose types of inmates kind of build up trust, you know, they come to work every day, they don\u2019t have any disciplinary, they\u2019re not causing any problem, and they build up trust in the system,\u201d Byers said. \u201cI think that contributed to his ability to do the things he needed to do in order to effectuate this escape.\u201d",
      "What also remains a mystery is how Hardin evaded law enforcement for 13 days. Authorities do not believe he had help from inside the prison or on the outside, Rand Champion, a Corrections Department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Excessive rain and thunderstorms rolled through the area during the first week of Hardin\u2019s escape. Because of the weather, tracking dogs had difficulty picking up a scent, drones couldn\u2019t be flown as high and helicopters were grounded, Champion said at a news conference.",
      "He told NBC News that crews were initially limited in where they could search.",
      "Tracking dogs picked up Hardin\u2019s scent in \ufeffMoccasin Creek, about 1.5 miles from the prison, around 3 p.m. on June 6. Authorities said in a news release that he was apprehended a short time later by U.S. Border Patrol and Arkansas law enforcement officers.",
      "Champion said Hardin tried to flee the search teams but \u201chad little resistance due to being on the run for an extended period of time.\u201d Hardin \u201cdidn\u2019t put up a fight once apprehended,\u201d Champion said.",
      "Hardin was taken to Varner Supermax prison in Gould, Arkansas, which also houses high-profile inmates, including convicted child rapist and murderer Zachary Holly, and Army center shooter Abdulhakim Muhammad. Champion said it\u2019s the most secure facility in the state.",
      "The community can now breathe a sigh of relief, Scheerer said.",
      "\u201cWe were just so happy that they caught him,\u201d Scheerer said. \u201cThis was an evil guy.\u201d"

      "As a massive manhunt for Vance Boelter continues, authorities are piecing together a profile of the alleged gunman accused of killing a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another in two separate \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d shootings on Saturday morning.",
      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman of Brooklyn Park and her husband, Mark, were killed in one shooting, and State Sen. John Hoffman of Champlin and his wife, Yvette, were severely injured in another. Hoffman and his wife remain hospitalized.",
      "Follow along for live updates",
      "Officials say Boelter impersonated law enforcement in order to gain access to the lawmakers' homes. Photos, believed to be of Boelter, show a man at one of the victim\u2019s doors wearing a long-sleeve shirt and what looks like a bulletproof vest similar to those worn by law enforcement. Another photo shows a man wearing a cowboy hat walking alone.",
      "Authorities found what they believe is his vehicle and cowboy hat in Sibley County, where an emergency alert has been issued for residents in the area to keep their doors locked and cars secured, NBC affiliate KARE 11 reported.",
      "Law enforcement, including Minnesota state troopers, set up a staging area Sunday about three miles away from Boelter's Green Isle home. Video showed armed state troopers in the area.",
      "He's married with five children",
      "Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson identified 57-year-old Boelter as the suspect in the shootings, describing him as 6-foot-1 with brown hair, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat and a dark long-sleeve collared shirt or coat. Jacobson urged the public not to approach Boelter if they see him, adding that he is \"armed and dangerous.\" During a press briefing Saturday Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the shootings were \"politically motivated.\"",
      "According to a video circulating online, Boelter is married and a father of five children. His wife, who has not been identified, was stopped by the Mille Lacs County Sheriff's Office Saturday morning in Onamia, Minnesota as part of a perimeter stop. There were \"several other relatives,\" in the car, according to the sheriff's office and no one in the vehicle was questioned or searched.",
      "He worked in Africa",
      "In a 2022 video posted to Facebook and verified by NBC News, Minnesota Africans United featured a person introduced as Vance Boelter during a discussion about trade and investment opportunities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As a keynote presenter, Boelter said he was calling from the DRC, and spoke about his work partnering with farmers and fishermen in the country to help them stimulate their food supply system.",
      "In a statement shared with NBC News, a spokesperson for Minnesota Africans United said \" there is no connection between Minnesota Africans United and the individual who carried out the assassinations and attacks\" on Hortman, Hoffman and their spouses.",
      "On his LinkedIn profile, Boelter listed himself as the CEO for Red Lion Group, although he also marked himself as \"open to work.\" It is not immediately clear what Red Lion Group is, but in a post from two years ago, he wrote that he was in the DRC \"working on several projects,\" and that the company \"had a great meeting with the new Governor of Congo Central to talk about our private business projects.\"",
      "Boelter was also listed as the Director of Security Patrols for a Minnesota-based company called Praetorian Guard Security Service, according to a biography posted on the company's website. In the bio, Boelter is said to have \"been involved with security situations in Eastern Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East, including the West Bank, Southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.",
      "In a LinkedIn post from six years ago, Boelter encouraged people to vote in the presidential election.",
      "\"I have been in several countries where people don't have the ability to vote for who their leaders are,\" Boelter wrote in the post. \"So I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America.\"",
      "He spoke at church sermons",
      "Boelter delivered church sermons in the DRC in 2021, 2022 and 2023, according to live streams posted to Facebook authenticated by NBC News. In a 2021 speech, he began with a prayer and then spoke about his path to becoming a better Christian.",
      "Boelter recounted working in a vegetable-canning factory at age 17 with a coworker who \"talked about God all the time,\"  ultimately inspiring him to take his religion more seriously.",
      "At one point during his testimony, Boelter dropped to his knees as he described the moment he dedicated his life to Jesus.",
      "\"And I said 'I'm so sorry, forgive me God, for living for myself, and not for you,'\" he said. \"And I said 'Jesus, if you forgive me of my sin and save me, I'll live for you for the rest of my life.'\"",
      "He worked for two funeral homes",
      "In a resume-style video circulating online, Boelter introduces himself as a married father of five from Green Isle, Minnesota, who works for two funeral homes, Wulff Funeral Home and Metro First Call, handling what he called \"removals.\"",
      "\u201cFun fact about myself, I\u2019ve been in the food industry about 30 years and that led to an opportunity. I was invited to the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d he said in the video, adding that he worked with Del Monte Foods and Minnesota-based chicken producer Gold\u2019n Plump.",
      "Boelter explained he left the food industry because his company \u201cwasn\u2019t interested in doing anything in Africa.\u201d Boelter said he then transitioned to the funeral home business while pursuing projects in Africa on his own.",
      "Boelter mentioned in the video that he was taking a course to learn more about the funeral industry, indicating it may have been taped for the class. The timing of the video, recorded using screen-recording software Screenpal, remains unclear.",
      "In a statement, Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter worked for the company from August 2023 until he \"voluntarily left\" in February of this year.",
      "\"To say anything more at this time would be irresponsible as the investigation continues,\" Koch said.",
      "'A loving, caring guy'",
      "Boelter's roommate, who was not identified, spoke to NBC affiliate KARE 11 about him.",
      "\"I mean, he was a loving, caring guy, you know,\" the man told the outlet. \"Loved his family, loved his friends, and loved God, and I don\u2019t know why he did what he did. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s not Vance. No one will believe this.\"",
      "The roommate said he received a final message from Boelter around 6 a.m. Saturday in which he said he \"may be dead shortly.\"",
      "\"So, I just want to let you know that I love you guys both, and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way,\" the text, read by Boelter's tearful roommate, read. \"I don\u2019t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way, because you guys don\u2019t know anything about this. But I love you guys, and I\u2019m sorry for all the trouble this has caused.\"",
      "It is not clear at this time whether the roommate lived with Boelter and his family, or if Boelter had been living separately from his family with the roommate.",
      "Anyone who sees Boelter is encouraged to call 911. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to Boelter\u2019s arrest."

    "summary": "With falling ticket prices and protests from MLS players ahead of the tournament, buy-in from fans and players has taken the spotlight.",
    "story": [
      "The debate that roiled soccer fans for generations was also its most unanswerable: Which clubs, on which continents, played the best soccer?",
      "Unlike national teams that played one another in the quadrennial World Cup, there was rarely overlap between the top teams in Europe and South America, or North America, except for summertime \u201cfriendly\u201d competitions.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup, which begins this weekend across the U.S. and runs through the final on July 13, expanded its previously smaller format in an attempt to provide an answer. It now features 32 teams, from six continents, playing for a total prize money pool of $1 billion.",
      "\u201cThis is for bragging rights,\u201d said Jill Ellis, the chief football officer of FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body, and a former World Cup-winning coach of the U.S. women\u2019s national team. \u201cPrize money is a part of it. But most importantly, this is a chance to be the first-ever club world champion.\u201d",
      "As the tournament opens, however, the money is more than just a small part of it. Falling ticket prices, and accusations from Major League Soccer players that the league had agreed to participate in a \u201ccash grab\u201d that unfairly compensates them, have raised the question of just how much buy-in the new tournament has from U.S. audiences and players.",
      "When tickets for Saturday\u2019s opening game in Florida between Inter Miami, featuring Lionel Messi, and Egyptian side Al Ahly went on sale in December through Ticketmaster, an upper-deck ticket cost $379 at the time. This week, similar ticket were on sale for as low as $116. According to NPR, FIFA has worked with a local Florida college to offer four complimentary tickets for students who pay for a single $20 ticket. Attendance for the opening game was announceed at 60,927, slightly shy of the stadium's capacity of 65,000.",
      "Bayern Munich, the perennial German champion, listed lower-bowl tickets for its opener Sunday in Cincinnati for as low as $107 when its tickets went on sale in December; on Saturday, tickets were being resold on Stubhub for half that.",
      "For as little as $8, fans can watch a June 25 game between the Japanese Urawa Red Diamonds and Mexican side C.F. Monterrey.",
      "\"We anticipace great attendances and electric atmospheres at its inaugural edition, with excitement growing with every round of matches and the tournament ultimately standing as the undisputed pinnacle of club world football,\" FIFA said, in part of a statement sent to NBC News. \"The appetite speaks for itself: fans from over 130 countries have already purchased tickets. The top 10 markets are led by the United States, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal \u2014 a clear sign of global anticipation and reach.\"",
      "As a new tournament, the Club World Cup cannot offer much in the way of prestige or history. Instead, it has offered a historic amount of prize money, with $525 million of the total $1 billion distributed to teams on a sliding scale, guaranteed, just for making the 32-team field. At the top, brand-name European teams such as Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain will earn between $12.8 and $38 million; at the bottom, New Zealand\u2019s Auckland City FC will earn $3.5 million.",
      "The remaining $475 million of the billion-dollar pool will then be determined by teams\u2019 performances; making the round of 16 earns each club $7.5 million, with quarterfinalists $13.1 million, and increasing up to the final. The winner can ultimately rake in up to $125 million, all of which adds up to much more than bragging rights \u2014 which has left Major League Soccer players asking why their cut from the windfall isn\u2019t greater.",
      "Before a June 1 match players from the Seattle Sounders donned white T-shirts during warmups that read \u201cClub World Ca$h Grab,\u201d with an image of the Mr. Monopoly character wearing an \u201cMLS\u201d top hat and holding a pouch reading \u201cFIFA.\u201d The protest led the team\u2019s owner to berate players afterward, according to the Seattle Times.",
      "The three teams in the Club World Cup field from Major League Soccer \u2014 Seattle, Inter Miami and Los Angeles Football Club \u2014 are each guaranteed $9.55 million for participating, before any bonuses are earned for performance. Players\u2019 earnings from participation or performance in a \u201ccompulsory tournament or noncompulsory tournament\u201d is capped at $1 million, per the terms of the league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.",
      "The players\u2019 union has continued to push publicly to increase\u2019 players stake from what is currently about a 90/10 split, and has noted that before a major tournament in 2024, the players and MLS renegotiated the prize money distribution before ultimately landing at a 50-50 split.",
      "In a statement to NBC News on Thursday, MLS said that it has \u201cagreed to voluntarily provide additional performance-based compensation to players from the three participating clubs.\u201d That proposal, the league said, would allocate 20% of all prize money earned from the group stage onward to players.",
      "\u201cIf an MLS club wins the Club World Cup, its players would collectively receive more than $24 million in performance bonuses,\u201d the statement read. \u201cMLS club owners believe performance-based incentives are appropriate given the expanded format and increased prize pool for the Club World Cup. The League values the continued dedication and commitment of its players and looks forward to supporting them as they represent their clubs \u2014 and Major League Soccer \u2014 on the global stage this summer.\u201d",
      "On June 8, the players association posted on X that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the league\u2019s proposal.",
      "\u201cThe timing, substance and retaliatory nature of the proposal sends a clear message: MLS does not respect or value players\u2019 efforts with regard to this tournament,\u201d the post read. \u201cAlthough not surprised, the players and the MLSPA are deeply disappointed by this message.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think sitting out is an option,\u201d Seattle midfielder Albert Rusnak told reporters Friday. \u201cJust because again, that inside what we have as athletes and winners and want to go out there and win and prove the people wrong whether we\u2019re talking about the bonuses or the people not believing we can do anything.\u201d",
      "Ellis, who works for FIFA, believes the prospect of playing on that global stage will lead to strong competition from players.",
      "\u201cI think the U.S. players, if you were to say to anyone, \u2018Do you want to play in this tournament?\u2019 Sure, do they want to be paid as much as probably \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s within their own league and within the MLS to determine that, because obviously, unlike a lot of leagues around the world, MLS has a salary cap,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSo there\u2019s certain different structures and CBA, and so that\u2019s internal to that.",
      "\u201cBut I think in terms of what I and my experience in working with some of the best players in the world, elite players want to play against elite players. They want to test themselves, prove themselves, and they want to compete. ... Listen, at the end of the day it\u2019s a choice, but I think players will want to play in this event.",
      "\u201c... In American sports when we win, when the Major League Baseball team wins, they\u2019re world champions. When the NFL team (wins) \u2014 the title is world champions. Well, yes, but they\u2019re playing against American teams. This is truly a world championship. This is the best clubs in the world.\u201d"

      "Grant Hardin\u2019s escape from the North Central Unit in Calico Rock last month involved detailed planning, perfect timing, and a makeshift outfit designed to mimic a law enforcement uniform. Hundreds of state, local and federal agents swarmed the small town, battling severe weather and rugged terrain to search for the man known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "After nearly two weeks on the run, he was found near an Izard County creek \u2014 about 1.5 miles west of the prison.",
      "The brazen prison break, which occurred a little more than a week after 10 inmates escaped a New Orleans jail,  exposed a security lapse at the facility that houses about 800 inmates. But  Hardin, who was described as a model inmate who never caused trouble, ultimately escaped because of one employee\u2019s error.",
      "\u201cThis was not an instance where there wasn\u2019t proper protocol or proper policy,\u201d Arkansas Department of Corrections board member William \u201cDubs\u201d Byers said in an interview. \u201cIt was a matter of the protocol not being followed. One person in particular just didn\u2019t pay attention as he should have and questioned this fellow when he walked out the back door.\u201d",
      "Urgent manhunt for \u2018Devil in the Ozarks\u2019",
      "It was just before 3 p.m. on May 25 when Hardin, disguised in a black T-shirt, black pants and a black baseball cap, strolled across the prison grounds. He was wheeling a cart carrying a box and wooden pallets.",
      "Byers said employees swipe their badges to exit the prison\u2019s front gate. Hardin left through a back sally port gate, which is typically used for vehicle traffic.",
      "The officer on duty was in a control tower and, based on preliminary information, assumed Hardin was an employee.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t pay close enough attention. He just thought that the person walking up was an officer because he looked like an officer,\u201d Byers said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk to him, he didn\u2019t question him, he didn\u2019t check him closely. He just opened the gate and assumed that he was an officer taking some things outside the fence.\u201d",
      "About 20 minutes had passed before a routine head count revealed that Hardin was missing. By then, he was long gone.",
      "Brian Scheerer, owner of Calico Cold Creek Manor, said people were on edge as law enforcement set up a perimeter around the prison.",
      "\u201cYou could tell that there was certainly a different vibe in the air. The streets were all closed where they were stopping just about everybody. They weren\u2019t taking any chances,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "His manor, which he rents out during the summer, is about four miles from the prison.",
      "\u201cPeople were hunkering in, even myself,\u201d Scheerer said. \u201cWhere my property is, it\u2019s very secluded. When I went to check my place after renters, I was very cautious.\"",
      "Prison break opens old wounds for victims",
      "Hardin was in prison for fatally shooting Gateway, Arkansas, city water employee James Appleton, and sexually assaulting teacher Amy Harrison. Both cases were featured in the Max documentary \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "According to an affidavit filed in the case, a passerby was driving home from work on Feb. 23, 2017, when he saw Appleton\u2019s truck stopped on the side of the road. Appleton was on the phone with his brother-in-law, then Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, and had pulled over so he would not lose the connection.",
      "Hardin\u2019s white car was stopped behind the truck, the passerby told police. After driving about a few hundred yards up the road, the passerby said he heard a loud bang and saw Hardin\u2019s car driving quickly up the street and turn down a dirt road, the affidavit states. The passerby turned around to check on Appleton and found him dead in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "Hardin, the former police chief of Gateway, was arrested that night as he returned home from having dinner with his wife and daughter. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the crime.",
      "DNA taken after his arrest linked him to the Nov. 9, 1997, sexual assault of Harrison at Frank Tillery Elementary School.",

      "Harrison told police she left her classroom and went to the lounge to use the restroom. When she came out, she said a man was standing in front of the door, pointing a gun at her. The affidavit states that she said she was sexually assaulted in the bathroom and then forced to move to a classroom, where she was raped.",

      "An investigation is being conducted to learn how he planned his escape. Byers said Hardin was a model inmate at the facility and believes he used that to his advantage.",
      "Hardin worked in the kitchen and never got in trouble while incarcerated, Byers said.",
      "\u201cThose types of inmates kind of build up trust, you know, they come to work every day, they don\u2019t have any disciplinary, they\u2019re not causing any problem, and they build up trust in the system,\u201d Byers said. \u201cI think that contributed to his ability to do the things he needed to do in order to effectuate this escape.\u201d",
      "What also remains a mystery is how Hardin evaded law enforcement for 13 days. Authorities do not believe he had help from inside the prison or on the outside, Rand Champion, a Corrections Department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Excessive rain and thunderstorms rolled through the area during the first week of Hardin\u2019s escape. Because of the weather, tracking dogs had difficulty picking up a scent, drones couldn\u2019t be flown as high and helicopters were grounded, Champion said at a news conference.",
      "He told NBC News that crews were initially limited in where they could search.",
      "Tracking dogs picked up Hardin\u2019s scent in \ufeffMoccasin Creek, about 1.5 miles from the prison, around 3 p.m. on June 6. Authorities said in a news release that he was apprehended a short time later by U.S. Border Patrol and Arkansas law enforcement officers.",

      "Hardin was taken to Varner Supermax prison in Gould, Arkansas, which also houses high-profile inmates, including convicted child rapist and murderer Zachary Holly, and Army center shooter Abdulhakim Muhammad. Champion said it\u2019s the most secure facility in the state.",
      "The community can now breathe a sigh of relief, Scheerer said.",
      "\u201cWe were just so happy that they caught him,\u201d Scheerer said. \u201cThis was an evil guy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul, a leading Republican critic of the sweeping Trump agenda bill, said during an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that he told President Donald Trump that he is \"not an absolute no\" on the package.",
      "\"I talked to the President last evening after the parade, and we're trying to get to a better place in our conversations,\" said Paul, R-Ky. \"And I've let him know that I'm not an absolute no.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have as much trouble with the tax cuts. I think there should be more spending cuts, but if they want my vote, they\u2019ll have to negotiate,\u201d Paul said, noting he did not want to vote to raise the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars.",
      "Republicans are working to pass the bill through a budget process called reconciliation, which allows them to pass the bill with a simple majority. Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate, meaning they can only afford to lose three votes if Vice President JD Vance is brought in to break a tie.",
      "Several Republican senators, however, have raised concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt and Medicaid, throwing the bill's future into question.",
      "Paul has been sharply critical of the Trump-backed \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d because it is projected to increase the national deficit by about $2.4 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The senator said last week that he had been \"uninvited\" to a White House picnic typically attended by lawmakers and their families. Paul said that he believed the White House was trying to \"punish\" him, calling the move \"petty vindictiveness.\" Trump later posted to Truth Social, saying that \"of course\" Paul was invited to the picnic.",
      "The reconciliation package as it stands would increase the debt ceiling. Lawmakers are also running up against a deadline this summer to avoid the U.S. defaulting on its debt. The Treasury Department has asked Congress to raise the debt ceiling by mid-July to avoid default.",
      "Asked what it would take for Paul to vote for the bill, the senator said, \"separate out the debt ceiling and have a separate vote on it.\"",
      "Paul, a fiscal hawk, has said that while the \"debt ceiling has to go up,\" he wants the ceiling to increase a few months at a time, \"and then we should have a renewed debate about the debt.\"",
      "The GOP-led package that passed through the House aims to raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion ahead of a mid-July deadline. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the package would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.",
      "Trump, however, has called for abolishing the debt limit, saying in a post last month that it \"should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe.\" It's one of the rare areas that the president has found common ground with liberal lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has been a vocal proponent of abolishing the limit.",
      "Trump said that the debt limit was \"too devastating to be put in the hands of political people that may want to use it despite the horrendous effect it could have on our Country and, indirectly, even the World.\"",
      "Paul also addressed Sen. Alex Padilla's detainment in California last week, when the California Democrat was forcibly removed from a press conference after trying to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that Padilla should be censured for his behavior during the press conference \u2014 a measure that Paul opposed.",
      "\"I'm not for censuring. I think that's crazy,\" Paul said.",
      "Paul said that he thought the situation \"could have ended without the handcuffs,\" but added that he did not think there could be a \"get out of jail free\" for \"rushing the stage.\"",
      "Video of the incident shared with NBC News does not show Padilla \"rushing\" toward Noem. Instead, the senator identified himself and tried to ask a question as several men pushed him out of the room. The video did not show the moments leading up to Padilla's question."

    "summary": "Sen. Amy Klobuchar said that authorities believe Vance Boelter, the suspect in a pair of \"politically motivated\" shootings, is still in the Midwest, noting that authorities have put out an alert in South Dakota.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Amy Klobuchar said that authorities believe Vance Boelter, the 57-year-old suspect in a pair of \"politically motivated\" shootings, is still in the Midwest, noting that \"he may be\" in Minnesota and that authorities have put out an alert in South Dakota.",
      "\"We believe he's somewhere in the vicinity and that they are going to find him,\" Klobuchar, D-Minn., said during an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"But right now, everyone is on edge here because we know that this man will kill at a second.\"",
      "NBC News has not been able to independently verify that an alert has been put out in South Dakota.",
      "The Minnesota Star Tribune reported that the Mitchell Regional Public Safety dispatch issued a \"be on the lookout\" alert, but an official from the Mitchell, South Dakota police department did not have knowledge of an alert specifically in South Dakota and told NBC News that the department is not aware of any indication that the suspect is in their area.",
      "Klobuchar's comments come after a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband were killed early Saturday in what Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., said appears to be \"a politically motivated assassination.\"",
      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were severely injured, Walz said. Authorities have identified the shooting suspect as 57-year-old Vance Boelter of Minnesota.",
      "Klobuchar emphasized that if people see Boelter, they \"should not approach him, that they should immediately call the tip lines and report.\"",
      "Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said on Saturday that they found a \"manifesto\" in Boelter's vehicle with names of other officials.",
      "An official who saw the list on the suspect\u2019s \u201cmanifesto\u201d previously told NBC News that it targeted prominent people in Minnesota who advocated for reproductive rights.",
      "After the shootings, Klobuchar said that she has received extra security without her request.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Saturday statement that he asked the Capitol Police to \"immediately increase security\" for Klobuchar and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also put out a statement on Saturday saying that he asked the \"the House Sergeant at Arms and United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of our Minnesota delegation and Members of Congress across the country.\"",
      "\"I think they're concerned about everyone,\" Klobuchar said of receiving added security. She said that she does not have confirmation as to whether she was on Boelter's list.",
      "The senator said that she was concerned that \"this guy is going to come up against just an innocent: Try to take their car, try to go into their house.\"",
      "\"Because a lot of the political leaders in our state have received extra protection, but not the innocents out there,\" she said.",
      "Smith, who has discussed being on the suspect\u2019s list, said in a Sunday interview on CNN that it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d to be named. She said that \u201cthe level of threat that lawmakers are exposed to is just unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m grateful that I personally feel safe, but this is no way for our government to work when people, any any number of us, feel this kind of personal threat,\u201d Smith said on CNN.",
      "Klobuchar mourned the loss of the couple killed, remembering that she was at a large political dinner with them the night before they died.",
      "\"Everyone was rejoicing, happy, the session's behind them, and that was the last time so many of us saw Melissa and Mark,\" Klobuchar said on NBC News, referring to the late lawmaker and her husband. \"And the next morning, 5 a.m., the governor, Governor Walz, calls me and tells me that we believe that she's no longer with us.\"",
      "Klobuchar remembered the late lawmaker as a friend, recalling how Hortman juggled being a mother, Sunday school teacher, girl scout leader, on top of her political career, eventually becoming \"this extraordinary Speaker of the House.\"",
      "\"When you think about political violence and the statistics of political violence, you've got to realize the people who are behind it and a true public servant that we lost,\" Klobuchar said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s second-term approval rating remains stuck in negative territory, along with general attitudes toward his administration\u2019s policies, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey.",
      "But immigration and border security remains an exception, as the president tries to drive national attention back toward his strongest issue \u2014 though Americans are closely divided even on that area of relative strength.",
      "Americans\u2019 ratings of two of the other defining projects of Trump\u2019s second term, tariffs and the Department of Government Efficiency, are more negative. And as Congress works on another major Trump initiative, a massive tax and spending plan, the poll illustrates how Republicans must manage internal differences over competing priorities on taxes and government debt.",
      "A majority (55%) of all adults over 18 years old said they disapprove of the way Trump\u2019s handling his job as president, while 45% approve, unchanged from April\u2019s NBC News Stay Tuned Poll.",
      "While the overall number was stable, under the surface there are small signs of waning enthusiasm for the president, with the share of adults who strongly approve decreasing slightly since April. The share who strongly disapprove also fell slightly, though intense negative feelings remain stronger than intense positive feelings in this poll.",
      "Republicans were 5 percentage points less likely to say that they strongly support the president compared to April, with much of this movement coming from Republicans who say they identify as being part of the MAGA movement moving into the \u201csomewhat approve\u201d category.",
      "The poll was conducted May 30-June 10, surveying 19,410 adults online nationwide with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.",
      "When asked to identify emotions about the president and his actions, fewer MAGA supporters picked \u201cthrilled\u201d compared to April, too. Thirty-seven percent said they\u2019re thrilled about the actions the Trump administration has taken so far during its term, down from 46% in April.",
      "In contrast, a majority (51%) of Democrats say they are \u201cfurious\u201d at the Trump administration\u2019s actions, showing a disparity in the intensity of feeling between the two parties. Indeed, Republicans shifted 7 percentage points away from being thrilled toward more neutral feelings about the president since April.",
      "This type of intensity gap has played a major role in past nonpresidential election cycles, and it may prove notable in off-cycle elections in New Jersey and Virginia this November, which generally see relatively lower turnout. Congressional Republicans and Trump will want to drive up enthusiasm among their base as they prepare to defend seats in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "A majority of independents said they feel dissatisfied, angry or furious with the actions of the administration. That\u2019s reflected in independents\u2019 approval rating of the president, with 65% saying they disapprove of his performance.",
      "Immigration remains Trump\u2019s strongest issue",
      "A majority of Americans said they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of border security and immigration, though the public is closely split on even his strongest issue, with 51% approving of his handling of immigration and border security and 49% disapproving.",
      "While the survey was being conducted, Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines to the Los Angeles area due to mounting protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the county. He has spoken repeatedly about the issue in recent days.",
      "While the public overall is divided on Trump\u2019s immigration policy, his base is motivated by the issue and his handling of it. While 9% of Americans overall said immigration is the issue that matters most to them right now, 20% of MAGA supporters said immigration is the most important issue, second only to the economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s overall numbers on immigration were similar to the April poll, but Republicans, MAGA Republicans and independents were all slightly more likely to say now that they strongly approve of the way Trump is handling border security and immigration.",
      "In recent months, the administration\u2019s immigration policies have overlapped with its higher education policies, especially those aimed at foreign students across the United States. The poll found a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of issues related to college and universities, with 56% disapproving of Trump\u2019s actions toward universities, including a 42% plurality who said they strongly disapprove.",
      "Trump\u2019s base, however, strongly approves of his handling of universities. MAGA supporters overwhelmingly approve, including 72% who said they strongly approve. Most Republicans also approve, including 57% who strongly approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the issue.",
      "On the question of how institutions like Harvard University affect the U.S., a plurality of Americans said they help the country (44%) and about a quarter (24%) said they hurt the country. Another 31% said colleges and universities like Harvard are not making a difference. Harvard has been at the forefront of legal battles with the Trump administration over grant money and the ability to enroll foreign students.",
      "A majority of MAGA supporters (65%)  and Republicans (53%) said universities like Harvard are mostly hurting the country, whereas three-quarters of Democrats said they help the country. Among independents, 46% said colleges and universities aren\u2019t making a difference and 42% said they\u2019re helping the country.",
      "Americans gave Trump negative ratings on how he\u2019s handling several other issues, including tariffs (40% approve, 60% disapprove), cost of living and inflation (39%-61%) and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts (44%-56%).",
      "Republicans split on priorities in Trump\u2019s big bill",
      "A slight majority of Americans (51%) said maintaining current spending levels on programs like Medicaid is the most important matter as Congress considers Trump-backed budget legislation this year. But it\u2019s closely split, within the margin of error, against a combined 49% who say a pair of Republican-aligned priorities are most important to them.",
      "The poll also illustrates how Republicans are trying to balance priorities and the demands of different parts of their narrow congressional majorities as they design the package.",
      "Mirroring the divisions among the Republican lawmakers negotiating the bill, 40% of Republicans said they care most about ensuring the national debt is reduced, while an almost identical share (39%) said they care most about continuing and expanding income tax cuts and credits enacted in 2017 by Trump. Another 2 in 10 Republicans said maintaining current spending is their most important budget priority.",
      "The findings come after a brief but explosive online feud between Trump and his former billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, who tarred the Republican legislation as a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d over its spending levels. Several Republican senators have also expressed concerns about spending levels in the bill, even while backing the idea of extending the 2017 tax breaks and enacting some new ones.",
      "Senate Republicans, who have a 53-seat majority, are aiming to pass their version of the legislation by July.",
      "Democrats surveyed in the poll overwhelmingly said their priority is maintaining current spending levels on programs like Medicaid (79%), as do a slight majority of independents (53%).",
      "DOGE ratings decline slightly",
      "Meanwhile, Americans\u2019 assessment of Musk\u2019s efforts with DOGE to reduce spending and the size of the federal government declined slightly since April.",
      "In the most recent survey, 44% rated it as a success or partial success, down from 47%, while 56% rated it a failure or partial failure, up from 52%.",
      "The change included an erosion among Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters on DOGE, with 49% of MAGA supporters now saying the effort is a success, down from 66% in April. The survey was in the field during Trump and Musk\u2019s recent feud, though the results on this question did not change appreciably over time.",
      "Economic concerns",
      "Economic ratings remain lukewarm: 45% of Americans said their personal financial situation is the same as one year ago and 34% said it\u2019s worse. Another 21% said they\u2019re financially better off than they were a year ago. The findings were almost identical in April.",
      "A bare majority of Americans (51%) think Trump\u2019s tariffs will make their personal finances worse in the next year. This number is slightly down from April, and most groups shifted toward saying that the tariff policies will result in their finances being \u201cabout the same.\u201d",
      "That finding comes as inflation was largely steady in May, with the impact of many on-again, off-again tariffs and ongoing negotiations with trade partners still unclear.",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk Poll is powered by SurveyMonkey. It was conducted online May 30-June 10 among a national sample of 19,410 adults ages 18 and over. Reported percentages exclude item nonresponse and round to the nearest percentage point. The estimated margin of error for this survey among all adults is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points."

      "Neither party has a distinct advantage when it comes to Americans looking for honesty in U.S. politics.",
      "A new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey asked Americans to rate the honesty of politicians from the two major parties on a sliding scale \u2014 whether they are \"always honest, sometimes honest, about equally honest and dishonest, sometimes dishonest, or always dishonest?\"",
      "The largest shares say politicians of both parties are sometimes or always dishonest. Among adults, 48% say that describes politicians from the Republican Party, and a slightly smaller 44% say that describes Democratic politicians.",
      "Close to one-third of adults say politicians from each party are \u201cabout equally honest and dishonest,\u201d while around 20% say politicians from each party are sometimes or always honest.",
      "The new data underscores the lack of trust in institutions that has bolstered political outsiders and fueled electoral backlash against incumbent parties and political leaders, not just in the U.S., but across the globe.",
      "And the cynicism extends to both political parties \u2014 as President Donald Trump, known for often spreading falsehoods, has returned to the White House, and as former President Joe Biden, who launched his successful 2020 campaign against Trump by calling for \"truth over lies,\" has faced serious and growing criticism that he and his closest allies were not honest about his fitness for office. Biden has said claims he was experiencing cognitive decline while in office are \"wrong.\"",
      "Americans are also critical of their own political parties, with majorities of Republicans and Democrats saying their own parties have at least some dishonest tendencies. A higher share of Republicans (22%) than Democrats (14%) say politicians from their own parties are sometimes or always dishonest.",
      "On the Republican side, 20% of those who align with President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement say GOP politicians are sometimes or always dishonest, and 25% of Republicans who align more with the party say the same.",
      "Democrats who say they are aligned more with progressive causes than the party itself are more likely to say their own party has dishonest politicians, with 18% saying they are sometimes or always dishonest, compared to 11% who say they align more with the Democratic Party.",
      "The distrust of politicians, even those aligned with their views, underscores how Americans are down on both parties.",
      "When asked which party fights for people like them, the largest share of Americans (37%) say neither party does, while 24% say the Democratic Party fights for them, 22% say the GOP does so, and 18% say both parties fight for them.",
      "Both parties\u2019 images are also underwater, with majorities viewing them unfavorably. Among adults, 57% view the Democratic Party unfavorably, while 43% view it favorably. And 56% view the GOP unfavorably while 44% view it favorably.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a social media post on Thursday that he is willing to exempt the agriculture and hotel industries from his nationwide immigration crackdown. The surprise move came after executives in both industries complained to Trump about losing reliable, longtime immigrant workers in immigration raids and struggling to replace them.",
      "\u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "\u201cIn many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs,\" Trump added. \"This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d",
      "The New York Times reported the following day that a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official had ordered a pause in immigration raids of agricultural businesses, meat packing plants, restaurants and hotels.",
      "The senior ICE official also advised agents to stop arresting undocumented people who are not known to have committed a crime. Agents were told to continue to investigate and detain undocumented people with criminal backgrounds, according to the New York Times.",
      "In response to a question from NBC News regarding Trump's pause, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin did not dispute it. \u201cWe will follow the president\u2019s direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America\u2019s streets,\" McLaughlin said in a statement.",
      "An immigration crossroads",
      "The potentially significant change in the administration\u2019s approach to immigration comes as Trump faces a political crossroads. Immigration raids in Los Angeles sparked days of violent protests there and helped fuel sweeping anti-Trump protests nationwide on Saturday.",
      "At the same time, Trump repeatedly promised his supporters during the 2024 campaign that he would deport a million people a year, the largest mass deportations in U.S. history.",
      "To meet that goal, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller demanded last month that ICE arrest at least 3,000 undocumented people a day.",
      "Three former DHS officials told NBC News that ICE officials will have to significantly increase raids of large workplaces nationwide to meet those goals. Those sites include farms, meat-packing plants, hotels and restaurants \u2014 the industries that Trump appears to have exempted.",
      "One former ICE official said that only raids on \u201cconstruction, dairy [and] meat processing facilities, carpet mills\u201d would result in the large number of detentions Miller has demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s these low-wage jobs, that is where you get the numbers,\u201d the former official said.",
      "During the 2024 campaign and since taking office, Trump has dismissed warnings from experts that such large-scale deportations would lead to worker shortages in the industries he is apparently exempting now.",
      "But groups that support Trump\u2019s crackdown expect him to keep his promise.",
      "\u201cThey should be going after them,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, spokesperson for Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that supports a crackdown on undocumented workers. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is going to be a huge swath of the country that will be upset if they bust these companies, if they are employing illegal immigrants and passing on the cost to everyone else.\u201d",
      "Targeting slaughterhouses",
      "For years, slaughterhouses have been one of the industry\u2019s best known for relying on newly arrived immigrant labor, in part, due to the difficult and dangerous nature of the work. And many slaughterhouses are located in red states scattered throughout the Midwest and Southeast.  Texas alone has almost 500 meat and food processing plants, according to USDA data.",
      "Earlier this week, ICE agents raided a locally owned slaughterhouse in Omaha, Nebraska and arrested at least 80 undocumented workers, according to local officials.Chad Hartmann, a spokesperson for Glenn Valley Foods, said in a statement that federal agents searched the company\u2019s facility \u201cfor persons believed to be using fraudulent documents to gain employment.\u201d He said that the company strives to operate within the law, that it is cooperating with agents and that it \u201cis not being charged with any crime.\u201d",
      "But so far large slaughterhouses have not been consistently targeted by ICE around the country.",
      "Since Trump took office in January, ICE\u2019s workplace enforcement raids appear to have largely targeted smaller businesses such as a roofer in Bellingham, Washington, a Mexican restaurant in Harlingen, Texas and a small equipment manufacturer in South Dakota. One of the largest workplace raids to date \u2014 which yielded more than 100 arrests \u2014was of a construction site in Tallahasseeoverseen by a privately-owned Florida-based construction company.",
      "Larry Stine, an employment attorney who represents some of the largest meat-packing plants in the Southeastern United States says his clients are \u201cterrified\u201d of a possible raid and have been actively conducting audits of their employees\u2019 paperwork.",
      "Few construction industry raids",
      "Trump did not mention an exemption for the construction industry, which also employs large numbers of immigrant workers. So far, though, the construction industry has experienced relatively few ICE raids, industry officials said.",
      "Brian Turmail, vice president of public affairs for the Associated General Contractors of America, said that to date, he is only aware of sporadic reports of construction-site raids, such as one in Tallahassee on May 29 where more than 100 allegedly undocumented individuals were detained.",
      "The contractors\u2019 association continues to prepare members for how to respond if the pace of enforcement actions increases. \u201cWe\u2019ve been reposting compliance information now that it\u2019s a bit more real,\u201d Turmail said.",
      "Turmail said he remains confident that the president is sensitive to the needs of the construction industry, whose decades-long workforce shortage has only grown more acute in recent years. It\u2019s one reason why construction costs have been surging, he said, something that, in turn, has resulted in construction spending declining year on year for the first time since 2019.",
      "\u201cBetween higher labor and higher material costs, it\u2019s putting developers on the sidelines because projects don\u2019t pencil out anymore,\u201d Turmail said.",
      "Members of the contactors' association remain hopeful that the administration\u2019s promises to reorient more of the workforce toward vocational skills will turn into federal spending to do so.",
      "Turmail predicted that worker shortages will persist and likely worsen if the immigration crackdown continues. One way the administration could help address them, he added, would  be creating ways for construction workers to enter the country legally.",
      "\u201cEven if we got all the funding we wanted, we\u2019d still need to also find some temporary lawful pathways for people to come in and work in construction,\u201d Turmail said.",
      "Democrats say Trump\u2019s campaign promises of millions of mass deportations are hitting economic realities. John Sandweg, who served as ICE director during the Obama administration, said that to maintain its 3,000 arrests per day quota, the Trump administration would have to raid factories owned by large corporations. \u201cNo doubt some Fortune 500 will get hit,\u201d he said."

      "Hartmann had never seen or experienced a raid before. He is finding out in real time that \u201cthere\u2019s no playbook\u201d on how to move forward after one, Hartmann told NBC News.",

      "EDMONTON, Alberta \u2014 Brad Marchand scored twice, Sam Bennett had his NHL playoff-leading 15th goal and the Florida Panthers moved to the verge of a second consecutive Stanley Cup title by beating the Edmonton Oilers 5-2 in Game 5 on Saturday night.",
      "The Panthers improved to 10-3 on the road this playoffs. They can hoist the Cup again as soon as Tuesday night if they win Game 6 on home ice in Sunrise.",
      "Florida this time built a multigoal lead and built on it, unlike a couple of previous games in the final. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 19 of the 21 shots he faced, making some important saves when needed, and was aided by lockdown defense that took ice away from the Oilers.",
      "Marchand, Bennett and Sam Reinhart provided the offense. Marchand joined Mario Lemieux as the only players in the past half-century to score five-plus goals in a final multiple times, and his 13 career goals in the final are the most among active players.",
      "Connor McDavid scored his first goal of the series after the Oilers fell behind 3-0. Reinhart\u2019s came 46 seconds later to restore the Panthers\u2019 three-goal lead, and by the time Corey Perry scored with 3:13 left, it was too late.",
      "Eetu Luostarinen sealed it with an empty-netter with 1:19 left, silencing the once fired-up crowd for a final time.",
      "Edmonton\u2019s power play went 0 for 3, a product of the Panthers\u2019 aggressive penalty kill knocking McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and the rest of the top unit out of their usual rhythm.",
      "Calvin Pickard lost for the first time in eight starts this spring, allowing four goals on 18 shots. He got the nod over Stuart Skinner after entering in relief and winning Game 4 to improve to 7-0, a record that is now 7-1.",
      "Skinner could be back in for Game 6, with the Panthers aiming to close things out following another cross-continental trip back to the other corner of North America. They are in this spot after bouncing back from blowing a three-goal lead and falling in overtime in Game 4, taking advantage of their depth to send the Oilers to the brink again."

      "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Through the first three quarters of Game 4 of the NBA Finals, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander \u2014 the regular season MVP \u2014 was faltering in the highest-stakes moment of his career.",
      "Though he had 20 points at the time, the Thunder were outscored by 16 with Gilgeous-Alexander on the floor. The offense looked discombobulated, and SGA was being hounded by Indiana Pacers guard (and childhood friend) Andrew Nembhard, unable to find space to operate.",
      "Oklahoma City looked very much in danger of going down 3-1, a deficit only one team has ever overcome in the championship round. And SGA was being rendered ineffective, forced to play off the ball by Nembhard\u2019s aggressive defense and failing to put his imprint on the game.",
      "But the MVP saved his best for last, scoring 15 points in the final frame, a poised response in the midst of a hard-fought battle.",
      "As a result, the Thunder out-clutched the most clutch team in the postseason with a 111-104 win \u2014 and now they\u2019re back in the driver\u2019s seat of the finals.",
      "\u201cI just tried to be aggressive,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said of his performance down the stretch. \u201cI knew what it would have looked like if we lost tonight. I didn\u2019t want to go out not swinging. I didn\u2019t want to go out not doing everything I could do in my power, in my control to try to win the game ... I guess it paid off.\u201d",
      "All of SGA\u2019s fourth-quarter points came in the last four minutes and 38 seconds of the game, accounting for 15 of his team\u2019s final 16 points.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know that, but that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Oklahoma City center Chet Holmgren said when told about that stat. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it before from him. We know that that\u2019s the type of player he is. But it\u2019s still impressive.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault. \u201cHe really didn\u2019t have it going a lot of the night. He was laboring. We had a hard time shaking him free. For him to be able to flip the switch like that and get the rhythm he got just speaks to how great of a player he is.\u201d",
      "It would have been easy for SGA to be frustrated.",
      "Game 4 was a slog. It was a physical matchup with both teams being called for over 25 fouls. And Nembhard was seemingly attracted to Gilgeous-Alexander by a magnetic force, following him around every square inch of the court.",
      "Instead, Gilgeous-Alexander remained at an even keel. When his team absolutely needed him to score, SGA found ways to evade Nembhard, often by drawing Indiana guard Aaron Nesmith into ball screens to force a switch, aggressively hunting a more favorable matchup.",
      "SGA finished the fourth quarter 3 of 6 from the field and 8 of 8 from the free-throw line, and the Thunder outscored the Pacers by 16 points in the 11 minutes and 12 seconds he was on the floor.",
      "It was the opposite of Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s Game 3 fourth-quarter performance, when he looked fatigued and scored only three points.",
      "\u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t know whether he\u2019s up three, down three, up 30, down 30, eating dinner on a Wednesday. He\u2019s pretty much the same guy,\u201d Daigneault said of his star\u2019s resolve.",
      "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know if it was a preseason game or it\u2019s Game 4 of the NBA Finals down 2-1 with him,\u201d Thunder guard Alex Caruso added. \u201cNo matter what\u2019s going on, you look at him and he\u2019s the same. Underneath that stoic personality or look on the court is a deep, deep-rooted competitiveness.\u201d",

      "\"I don't want to make a big PR pronouncement like 'This is my decision,'\" Hamill said. \"I\u2019m just saying that it really felt like a conclusion. My character was given complete closure. I died, ironically by overdosing on the Force, I might point out.\"",

      "If you stand still too long, people will peg you \u2014 at least according to Bryan Cranston. \u201cI like to keep people guessing,\u201d he tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "That\u2019s why the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d actor says he prefers to \u201ckeep moving around\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m playing a lot of dramatic roles recently, I will look for comedic roles and I keep swimming back and forth so that I\u2019m not pegged as any given one person,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s that versatility that\u2019s earned Cranston six Emmy Awards, two Tonys, a best actor Oscar nomination and a host of other accolades. And, at 69, he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.",
      "Cranston currently appears in the latest Wes Anderson film, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d along with starring in \u201cEverything\u2019s Going to Be Great,\u201d a new drama for which Cranston learned how to play the bagpipes. If that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019ll soon be crossing the Atlantic to perform on London\u2019s famed West End in the Arthur Miller play \u201cAll My Sons,\u201d starting in November.",
      "\u201cI do love it. I have a relationship with this,\u201d explains Cranston. \u201cIt takes a committed relationship, that you\u2019re committing to this as your life, just like you would in your personal life. And if you do so, you have a chance to be successful in your personal life or your business life.\u201d",
      "No stranger to success, Cranston got his start doing bit parts in a variety of TV shows and movies before landing the breakout role of Hal Wilkerson in \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d in 2000. It's a role that earned him a handful of Emmy nominations and made Cranston a household name.",
      "However, it was the brief part he played in a 1998 episode of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d that put Cranston on the radar of one of the show\u2019s writers, Vince Gilligan. Eight years later, when Gilligan went to cast Walter White in his new antihero show, \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d he remembered Cranston and rang up the actor\u2019s agent. That decision would forever cement their legacies in television history.",
      "'You\u2019re Only as Good as You Dare to Be Bad'",
      "With a storied career in film, stage and television (both behind and in front of the camera), Cranston says he continues to seek out unique roles and opportunities that speak to him on a personal level.",
      "\u201cMy real life is filled with a variety of different characters. I\u2019m sometimes sincere, sometimes silly, sometimes moody, sometimes romantic ... and so there are different facets of ourselves that you are familiar with in your own life. Sometimes you\u2019re sad, sometimes you\u2019re joyous,\u201d explains Cranston.",
      "\u201cSo, I curate the roles I do. I look for roles that I can be different or something that challenges me that, 'Ooh, that\u2019s really not like me at all,' so I need to dive into that and see what comes of it,\u201d he says.",
      "In fact, it\u2019s his willingness to take risks that\u2019s gotten him this far, and it\u2019s based on advice he once received. Though Cranston can\u2019t quite remember exactly where he got it from, he says that outside of being kind, working hard and showing up on time, it's the best advice he's ever gotten.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re only as good as you dare to be bad, right? If you take chances that you could fall on your face, you could fail, it\u2019s that point that you can also turn and have it really work. So, don\u2019t play safe. Extend yourself, take chances, take risks and see what happens,\u201d Cranston tells TODAY.com.",
      "Is that the advice he gives his daughter, actor Taylor Dearden?",
      "\u201cFirst of all, as her dad, she does not want my direct advice,\u201d he says with a laugh about Dearden, whom he shares with wife Robin Dearden. The 32-year-old currently stars in the Max hospital drama \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d a role for which she\u2019s garnered glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cTaylor is a wonderful, hardworking actor,\u201d Cranston told Craig Melvin during a recent segment on TODAY. \u201cShe grew up in this business with my wife and I being actors. And so, we\u2019re so proud of her.\u201d",
      "\u2018I Need to Outwork Everyone\u2019",
      "While Cranston may not dole out much career advice to Dearden, he tells TODAY.com that he does what he can to be a solid role model instead.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can relay to her is how I have been for her 32 years on this planet and try to live a good life and be an exemplar to her, as she can look at and say, \u2018Well, this is how he did things and that seemed to work for him.\u2019 Or, \u2018Oh, he tried that and that didn\u2019t work, so I\u2019m going to do something different,\u2019\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s basically it. Just live a true life and let your kids see that and hopefully they\u2019ll make their own proper decisions.\u201d",
      "That mindset likely comes from his parents, who Cranston says were instrumental in instilling his own work ethic.",
      "\u201cBoth my mother and father were hardworking people and they came from very humble, hardworking families, (they were) children during the Depression. It was, go out there every single day, try to find a job. That\u2019s what their parents were faced with. And so it carries on,\u201d says Cranston.",
      "With his parents as his example, Cranston says he learned early on that if he wanted to make a career out of acting, he needed to be fully committed.",
      "\u201cI realized as a young actor that there were always going to be actors who were better than me. At the same time, there were always going to be actors who weren\u2019t as good as me. And the only thing I can control is how hard I worked,\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cI know I can outwork people and that was my motto \u2014 I need to outwork everyone. So when I was a young actor, 22, 23, people were going out and they were partying every night. Not me. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to class. I\u2019m studying. I\u2019m learning monologues because I need to outwork everybody and I need to be ready.\u2019 And that was it, because this is what I wanted. I wanted a career as an actor.\u201d",
      "And it\u2019s that advice that Cranston passes along to young actors hoping to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cI say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to commit.\u2019 It\u2019s got to be, \u2018You\u2019re all in, go all in.\u2019 Because if you\u2019re not putting all of your energy into it, what are you waiting for? Why would you not? You've got to. And it still doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be successful, just like a personal life. But you\u2019ve got to try, and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d"

      "Spoilers ahead for \u201cMaterialists.\u201d",
      "When Celine Song wrote the script for her debut feature film, \u201cPast Lives,\u201d she was inspired by a conversation she had at a New York bar with her husband and her childhood sweetheart, who was visiting from South Korea.",
      "While translating between Korean and English for these important men in her life, she discovered that she was also translating \u201ctwo parts of myself,\u201d Song explained in an interview with BAFTA.",
      "The romantic drama, starring Greta Lee and Teo Yoo, showcased a love triangle \u2014 but one that Song has previously described as the past, present and future of her life and the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d that so many people oftentimes think about.",
      "The 36-year-old director and writer captivated audiences with her authentic and heartbreaking film \u2014 and it\u2019s all because of her real-life experience.",
      "\u201cPast Lives\u201d earned Song an original screenplay Oscar nomination, and the film was also nominated for best picture.",
      "So when it came to her latest romantic comedy, \u201cMaterialists,\u201d Song once again took inspiration from her personal life.",
      "As an aspiring playwright in New York City, Song didn\u2019t have the experience to work as a barista or in retail. Instead, after meeting a matchmaker at a party, she applied for the same position.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019ll try to get that job,\u2019\u201d Song tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd then I worked on it for like, six months. But I feel like I learned more about human beings in those six months than I did in any other part of my life. And in fact, it become kind of a big part of what I know about people too.\u201d",
      "Years later, those six months would eventually lead to her second feature film starring Dakota Johnson as Lucy, a high-end New York matchmaker who attempts to set up her rich and successful clients with other elite bachelors and bachelorettes. She's good at her job, which has led to nine successful marriages.",
      "However, Lucy's approach to having someone find their happily ever after is determined by math, calculations and numbers. When Lucy asks who her clients want to be buried next to and change their diapers when they grow old, her clients tell her the weight, height, salary and age range they want in a partner, focusing on the material aspects.",
      "At first it appears as if these marriages aren't based on happiness and how another person makes you feel. These are business transactions and what each person brings to the table.",
      "Lucy, on her end, also considers herself a professional \u2014 cold at times, and practical. At a wedding, she meets Harry (Pedro Pascal), a tall, handsome and extremely rich businessman who is very interested in her. At that same wedding, she runs into her ex-boyfriend John (Chris Evans), a struggling cater waiter and aspiring actor.",
      "Flashbacks show that Lucy and Chris, despite having a strong bond, had called it quits over financial issues.",
      "What comes next is someone torn between being in love with a person who doesn't check all the boxes and another who does.",
      "This love triangle was not a part of Song\u2019s own time as a matchmaker, though other moments in the film do come from her past. An ending courthouse wedding scene was inspired by her own civil ceremony with husband and \u201cChallengers\u201d screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes.",
      "\u201cI got married at the courthouse first,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a party after.\u201d",
      "Song ultimately decided to call it quits as a matchmaker, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t writing, because it was too fun,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was supposed to be a day job and it was becoming like my full time thing ... I only did it for six months but some of them resulted in a second date, which is a win.\u201d",
      "When it comes to drawing inspiration from her personal experiences for her work, Song says it has to teach her something and \u201cit always has to be something that fascinates me.\u201d",
      "\u201cOr something that makes me feel like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know enough about that,\u2019\u201d she continues. \u201cThe story has to feel like it knows more than me, is wiser than me, and it\u2019s better than me in that way.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaterialists\u201d asks: Is love easy? Is checking the boxes better than a real connection? Does being taller make you a better catch, among other measurable features.",
      "There\u2019s a scene in \u201cMaterialists\u201d when Lucy is talking to her co-worker about a surgery that can make a person taller. The two matchmakers candidly speak about the benefits of such procedure when it comes to finding a partner.",
      "Later on, Lucy discovers that Harry actually had the surgery and added six inches to his height. He admits that after the procedure, his whole life changed and more women became interested in him.",
      "While the audience laughed in the screening I attended during those moments, Song calls it \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because you\u2019re seeing the way that it is materially and tangibly affecting somebody like Harry. The standards, numbers like height, all of that,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhat Harry is going through is very difficult as well, and I\u2019m really interested in depicting men fairly.\u201d",
      "The idea of a \u201cunicorn,\u201d a rare and nearly perfect candidate, is also a product of the materialistic world, Song says. She hopes male viewers can relate.",
      "\u201cSo often the topics of romance are reduced to girl s---,\u201d she says, adding that matters of the heart are not just for women. \u201cThe truth is, men are also crushed by the dating market. They\u2019re also crushed by the way that we date and with the way that we objectify and commodify ourselves and each other. I really wanted there to be a very real consequence for men in the film, and have them be crushed by the same dating market that crushes (Lucy's client) Sophie or Lucy.\u201d",
      "Song hopes \u201cMaterialists\u201d start an open-hearted and honest conversation about what it\u2019s like to date and love in 2025.",
      "And when asked, \u201cIs love easy?\u201d Song replies, \u201cLove is easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s also hard when people are afraid to let go of control and completely surrender,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut the truth is, I think, when it happens, it just happens. They say, \u2018If you know, you know.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of what it is. You face it, and then when you face love, it\u2019s very simple and it\u2019s very easy.\u201d"

      "Vera Jayne Palmer, born April 19, 1933, was the only child of Herbert and Vera Palmer. At the age of 3, she was inside a vehicle with her mother and father when her dad experienced a heart attack and died while driving. She took the last name Peers when her mother remarried in 1939, according to the Texas State Historical Association. It would be a decade after that before young Vera went by the name that followed her into film.",

      "Mansfield welcomed her second child, son Mickey Hargitay Jr., in 1958. He was one of three children Mansfield gave birth to during her marriage to her second husband. Their other son, Zoltan Hargitay, was born in 1960. They celebrated the arrival of daughter Mariska in 1964.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."

      "Israel\u2019s military strikes on Iran have struck at the heart of the country\u2019s military leadership and nuclear program, creating a possible vacuum at the top of the regime that could hinder its ability to recover from the onslaught, experts say.",
      "But \u2014 assuming that it still can \u2014 there is a scenario in which the strikes could lead Tehran to abandon negotiations over its nuclear program and instead rush toward building a bomb, according to analysts and former U.S. officials.",
      "The killing of top Iranian military officers as well as several nuclear scientists will likely have sparked fears in Tehran that Israeli intelligence had deeply penetrated the regime and that other senior figures could also be in danger.",
      "Israel has previously pulled off brazen assassinations inside Iran, targeting senior government scientists involved in the country\u2019s nuclear program and the political leader of the Iranian-backed Palestinian group Hamas when he was visiting Tehran.",
      "\u201cYou have to assume the system is shell-shocked,\u201d said Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t know\u2026 how badly they\u2019re infiltrated\u201d by Israel.",
      "Iranian media and the Israeli military said Israel\u2019s strikes on Thursday killed Iran\u2019s top military officer, Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, as well as the commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, and a major general in the Revolutionary Guards, Gholam Ali Rashid.",
      "The senior military officers targeted had deep ties to Iran\u2019s regime and were known personally by the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, particularly Bagheri, according to Vatanka. Khamenei promoted Bagheri to his post as chief of the armed forces in 2016.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a personal element here, which might be a factor in terms of what Khamenei decides to do,\u201d he said.",

      "Nuclear program\u2019s future",
      "The first wave of Israeli military strikes launched Thursday likely inflicted serious damage on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that air raids will continue for \u201cas many days as it takes\u201d to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear arsenal.",
      "But Iran still has buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and elsewhere that it could potentially use if it chose to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and rescind its commitment not to pursue nuclear weapons. In that case, Iran would need to enrich uranium to weapon-grade levels, a short technical step with its current stockpile, and then build a nuclear warhead. That effort could take roughly a year or more, most experts estimate.",
      "The CIA declined to comment as to whether there were any indications that Iran was moving to pull out of the NPT and pursue nuclear weapons.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be trying to use the Israeli military attack as leverage over Iran, pushing it to make concessions or else face even harsher military strikes. But Iran may calculate that the time for negotiations is over and opt to build nuclear weapons, according to Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.",
      "\u201cOne of the strategic risks in targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure is the potential for backlash,\u201d Vaez said. The strikes \u201ccould incentivize Tehran to reconstitute its program with renewed urgency, driven by a heightened resolve to achieve a credible nuclear deterrent,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran has invested decades of effort and trillions of dollars in building its nuclear program, and Iranian political leaders portray it as a point of national pride, a symbol of the country\u2019s independence and technological progress.",
      "Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said Iran\u2019s leadership will likely choose to develop nuclear weapons rather than give up the program it sees as a patriotic endeavor.",
      "\u201cIt has become a symbol of national prestige and honor,\u201d Miller said on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cWhen all is said and done, and this regime stays in power, which I suspect it will, the Iranians will probably make a decision to go all out in an effort to weaponize,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd the Americans and the Israelis are going to have to figure out, over time, how to deal with it.\u201c",
      "Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Iran may conclude that pursuing nuclear weapons is the only way to safeguard the regime.",
      "Iran \u201cmay determine that the Israeli strikes mean time is up for the regime to decide whether to obtain a bomb, if it hasn\u2019t done so already,\u201d Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in an analysis. \u201cThe conclusion could be that it can no longer sit on the proverbial nuclear fence, and that it has to rush for a bomb or risk never having one.\u201d",
      "To many Iranian political leaders, securing a nuclear weapon -- or nuclear weapons capability -- is vital for the survival of the regime itself, he added.",
      "But it was unclear if Israel\u2019s military strikes could deliver a knock-out blow that would make it impossible for Iran to build nuclear weapons, some experts said.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former senior Pentagon official and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said it was likely that the Israeli assault, which included sabotage operations, had caused too much damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and equipment to enable Iran to rush toward building a bomb.",
      "Iran was caught flat-footed by the Israeli attack, even though Israel had sent clear warnings for years and in recent months that it would not tolerate an advancing Iranian nuclear program, Plitsas said.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have misread the signals from Israel again and again,\u201d he said.",
      "Even a successful series of strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites might only delay Tehran\u2019s ability to develop the bomb by up to two years, according to past comments by U.S. officials and estimates by experts.",
      "In 2012, Robert Gates, shortly after he stepped down as defense secretary, said military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program would likely fail in the end to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb.",
      "\u201cSuch an attack would make a nuclear-armed Iran inevitable,\u201d Gates said at the time. \u201cThey would just bury the program deeper and make it more covert.\u201d",
      "Iran maintains its nuclear program is designed for purely civilian purposes to generate energy and research, but Western powers have long accused Tehran of laying the ground for a nuclear weapons project, citing enrichment activity far beyond what\u2019s required for peaceful uses. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Iran had a nuclear weapons program but halted the project in 2003.",
      "A report in May from the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded Iran was not fully cooperating with U.N. inspectors and that the agency could not provide assurance that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cexclusively peaceful.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations designed to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in 20 years.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for pulling, during his first term, the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that imposed limits on its nuclear activities, saying that decision opened the way to the current crisis."

    "story": [
      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "But three U.S. officials told NBC News later Friday that the U.S. is assisting in shooting down Iranian missiles and projectiles targeting Israel. The Pentagon also moved a number of military assets into the region in recent days to support the operation, according to another U.S. official.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",

      "\u201cGame on,\u201d Graham \u2014 whose hawkish worldview predates the rise of the MAGA movement \u2014 wrote on X on Thursday night as video of explosions in Tehran bounced around the world.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, Infowars host Owen Shroyer, one of the hundreds of people pardoned by Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, posted a video to X that framed the new conflict as an existential question for the president\u2019s base.",
      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make America great again,\u201d he added, \u201cas long as we\u2019re entangled in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",
      "In the hours after the strikes, Trump allies hewed closely to the administration\u2019s sparse talking points.",
      "Alex Bruesewitz, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House, shared Rubio\u2019s statement on X, emphasizing that the \u201cUS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN STRIKES AGAINST IRAN.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Laura Loomer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist aligned with Trump, posted several messages supportive of Trump and Israel.",
      "\u201cIran,\u201d Loomer wrote, \u201cmust never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Mehek Cooke, an attorney and pro-Trump political commentator active in the MAGA movement, said Friday that her recent visit to Israel opened her eyes to the \u201cdevastation of Iran\u2019s Oct. 7 proxy war\u201d there.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",
      "Asked to explain the tension within the MAGA movement, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

      "Eight of the 34 Dreamliner aircraft in India have already undergone inspection, Kinjarapu said, adding that the remaining aircraft will be examined with \u201cimmediate urgency.\u201d",
      "The government is eagerly awaiting results of the crash investigation by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and all necessary steps will be taken without hesitation, Kinjarapu said.",
      "Investigators on Friday recovered the plane\u2019s digital flight data recorder, or the black box, which was recovered from a rooftop near the crash site and likely will lead to clues about the cause of the accident.",
      "India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said it had started working with \u201cfull force\u201d to extract the data.",
      "The device is expected to reveal information about the engine and control settings, while the voice recorder will provide cockpit conversations, said Paul Fromme, a mechanical engineer with the U.K.-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers.",
      "Aviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti, a former crash investigator for both the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, said investigators should be able to answer some important questions about what caused the crash as soon as next week as long as the flight data recorder is in good shape.",
      "Investigators likely are looking at whether wing flaps were set correctly, the engine lost power, alarms were going off inside the cockpit and if the plane\u2019s crew correctly logged information about the hot temperature outside and the weight of the fuel and passengers, Guzzetti said.",
      "Mistakes in the data could result in the wing flaps being set incorrectly, he said.",
      "Thursday\u2019s Air India crash involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft.",
      "There are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation, according to experts."

      "LONDON \u2014 British soccer legend David Beckham, a sporting icon and one of the world's most recognizable faces, has received a knighthood from King Charles III for services to sport and charity,  Buckingham Palace announced Friday.",
      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" Beckham said in a statement issued Friday through the Press Association news agency.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, was almost inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he had not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and near-permanent fixtures in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that concerns over national security risks posed by Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel can be resolved if the companies fulfill certain conditions that his administration has laid out, paving the way for the deal\u2019s approval.",
      "Shares of U.S. Steel rose 3.5% on the news in after-the-bell trading as investors bet the deal was close to done. Trump, in an executive order, said conditions for resolving the national security concerns would be laid out in an agreement, without providing details. \u201cI additionally find that the threatened impairment to the national security of the United States arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction can be adequately mitigated if the conditions set forth in section 3 of this order are met,\u201d Trump said in the order, which was released by the White House.",
      "The companies thanked Trump in a news release, saying the agreement includes $11 billion in new investments to be made by 2028 and governance commitments including a golden share to be issued to the U.S. government. They did not detail how much control the golden share would give the U.S. Shares of U.S. Steel had dipped earlier on Friday after a Nippon Steel executive told the Japanese Nikkei newspaper that its planned takeover of U.S. Steel required \u201ca degree of management freedom\u201d to go ahead after Trump earlier had said the U.S. would be in control with a golden share.",
      "The bid, first announced by Nippon Steel in December 2023, has faced opposition from the start. Both Democratic former President Joe Biden and Trump, a Republican, asserted last year that U.S. Steel should remain U.S.-owned, as they sought to woo voters ahead of the presidential election in Pennsylvania, where the company is headquartered.",
      "Biden in January, shortly before leaving office, blocked the deal on national security grounds, prompting lawsuits by the companies, which argued the national security review they received was biased. The Biden White House disputed the charge.",
      "The steel companies saw a new opportunity in the Trump administration, which began on January 20 and opened a fresh 45-day national security review into the proposed merger in April.",
      "But Trump\u2019s public comments, ranging from welcoming a simple \u201cinvestment\u201d in U.S. Steel by the Japanese firm to floating a minority stake for Nippon Steel, spurred confusion.",
      "At a rally in Pennsylvania on May 30, Trump lauded an agreement between the companies and said Nippon Steel would make a \u201cgreat partner\u201d for U.S. Steel. But he later told reporters the deal still lacked his final approval, leaving unresolved whether he would allow Nippon Steel to take ownership.",
      "Nippon Steel and the Trump administration asked a U.S. appeals court on June 5 for an eight-day extension of a pause in litigation to give them more time to reach a deal for the Japanese firm. The pause expires Friday, but could be extended.",
      "June 18 is the expiration date of the current acquisition contract between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, but the firms could agree to postpone that date"

      "Israel has become more serious about a unilateral strike on Iran as the negotiations between the United States and Iran appear closer to a preliminary or framework agreement that includes provisions about uranium enrichment that Israel views as unacceptable.",
      "Details about the Israeli discussions emerged before the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors formally found that Iran is not complying with its nuclear obligations for the first time in 20 years.",
      "In the draft resolution, the board, which represents member nations including the United States, renews a call on Iran to provide answers \u201cwithout delay\u201d in a long-running investigation into uranium traces found at several locations that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.",
      "Were Israel to launch a unilateral strike against Iran, it would be a dramatic break with the Trump administration, which has argued against such a step.

The United States could support with aerial refueling or intelligence sharing rather than kinetic support, but the sources and officials were not aware of plans for that, either, at this point.",

In October, Israel damaged nearly every one of Iran\u2019s strategic air defense systems (mainly S-300s), but much of the damage was to the radars or other parts that can be rebuilt. It is possible Israel\u2019s window for manned strikes, without being threatened by Iran\u2019s coordinated strategic air defenses, is closing.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s about trying to get Iran to respect the president\u2019s wishes,\u201d Knights said.",
      "Iran has failed to meet a two-month deadline Trump set to reach an agreement on the country\u2019s nuclear activities, and he is frustrated, he said.",

    "summary": "Ballymena, Northern Ireland, has endured a third night of rioting by racist thugs targeting immigrants, with homes, stores and cars destroyed.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Dozens of mostly young men torched homes and smashed in windows in a Northern Irish town late Wednesday, in a third night of what officials described as coordinated \u201cracist thuggery\u201d against the community\u2019s ethnic minorities.",
      "Some residents of Ballymena, a town about 25 miles northwest of Belfast with a population of 30,000, responded to the anti-foreigner vigilantism by sticking the Union Jack or signs in their windows reading \u201cBritish household\u201d and \u201clocals live here\u201d in an apparent attempt to be spared by the rioters.",
      "NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News has seen residents from ethnic minorities packing up suitcases and leaving their homes, while others have spoken of their terror that the mob violence will continue.",
      "The violence first flared Monday during a vigil for a teenage girl who was the victim of an alleged sexual assault two days before. Two teenage boys, both 14, were charged with attempted rape and appeared in court Monday, communicating through a Romanian translator. The boys' identities have not been released because of their age.",
      "Masked rioters broke away from the otherwise peaceful vigil, building barricades and throwing bricks, Molotov cocktails and fireworks at houses and police.",
      "Riot police responded with rubber bullets and a water cannon. More than 40 officers have been injured over the three nights, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, known as the PSNI, said.",
      "The violence also spread to other towns in Northern Ireland, such as Coleraine, where a bus station was attacked, access to the train station was blocked and rioters pushed trash cans onto the rails and set them alight Wednesday night, police said.",
      "In Larne, some people whose homes were destroyed were given shelter at a leisure center \u2014 until that was targeted and set on fire, too.",
      "In total, 10 people, all men in their teens, 20s and 30s, have been arrested. Three of them, aged 18, 17 and 15, have been charged and are set to appear in court Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis violence was clearly racially motivated and targeted at our minority ethnic community and police,\u201d Ryan Henderson, PSNI assistant chief constable, said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cIt was racist thuggery pure and simple and any attempt to justify and explain it as something else is misplaced.\u201d",
      "A Bulgarian national who lives in Ballymena and asked that her identity be protected told Sky News, \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, honestly, I\u2019m scared to get out of the house,\u201d",
      "She said she had been in Northern Ireland \u201cfor a while \u2014 I\u2019ve pursued an education here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve done multiple things for the community and it\u2019s just absolutely heartbreaking that it\u2019s not the same Ballymena that I had when I first came here.\u201d",
      "\"It is important,\" said Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a think tank that focuses on immigration, identity and integration, \"to draw the clearest red line between the legitimate debate about immigration policy, including numbers, the pace of change and the quality of integration, and hateful abuse and threats.\"",
      "\u201cGovernments need to manage asylum much better nationally and locally,\u201d he said, \u201cbut must challenge more forcefully those stoking hatred and socializing violence against migrants, and the platforms that let hatred run riot without impediment.\u201d",
      "Northern Ireland is no stranger to unrest, but usually between \u201cunionists\u201d \u2014 mostly Protestants who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom \u2014 and \u201crepublicans\u201d \u2014 mostly Catholics who want it to become part of the Irish Republic.",
      "Though this conflict, called \u201cthe Troubles,\u201d officially ended with a peace deal in 1998, sporadic clashes still break out between these often segregated communities and police.",
      "This week\u2019s unrest in Ballymena follows a different trend, however. Anti-foreigner sentiment has in recent years surged across the U.K. and indeed Europe and the West.",
      "As prices for food, fuel and housing rise due to inflation, and public services become squeezed, some politicians mainly on the populist hard-right have sought to blame mass immigration for putting undue stress on the system.",
      "Pro-immigration progressives argue that immigrants provide an essential net benefit to society, both bringing high-level skills and filling less glamorous but necessary jobs.",
      "Last summer, anti-immigrant violence flared across the U.K. after three young girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in the town of Southport in northwest England.",
      "Online misinformation wrongly identified the British-born attacker as an immigrant."

      "SYDNEY \u2014 Australia\u2019s defense minister said Thursday he was confident that the AUKUS submarine pact with the United States and Britain would proceed, and that his government would work closely with the U.S. while the Trump administration conducted a formal review.",
      "Australia in 2023 committed to spend 368 billion Australian dollars ($239 billion) over three decades on AUKUS, the country\u2019s biggest ever defense project with the U.S. and Britain, to acquire and build nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "A Pentagon official said the administration was reviewing AUKUS to ensure it was \u201caligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d on the eve of expected talks between President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "In an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio interview, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said AUKUS was in the strategic interests of all three countries and that the new review of the deal signed in 2021 when Joe Biden was the U.S. president was not a surprise.",
      "\u201cI am very confident this is going to happen,\u201d he said of AUKUS, which would give Australia nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "\u201cThis is a multi-decade plan. There will be governments that come and go and I think whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken,\u201d Marles told the ABC.",
      "Albanese is expected to meet Trump for the first time next week on the sidelines of the Group of 7 meeting in Canada, where the security allies will discuss a request from Washington for Australia to increase defense spending from 2% to 3.5% of gross domestic product.",
      "Albanese has said defense spending would rise to 2.3% and has declined to commit to the U.S. target.",
      "The opposition Liberal party on Thursday pressed Albanese to increase defense spending.",
      "Under AUKUS, Australia was scheduled to make a $2 billion payment in 2025 to the U.S. to help boost its submarine shipyards and speed up lagging production rates of Virginia-class submarines to allow the sale of up to three U.S. submarines to Australia starting in 2032.",
      "The first $500 million payment was made when Marles met with his U.S. counterpart, Pete Hegseth, in February.",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s top policy adviser Elbridge Colby, who has previously expressed concern that the U.S. would lose submarines to Australia at a critical time for military deterrence against China, will be a key figure in the review, examining the production rate of Virginia-class submarines, Marles said.",
      "\u201cIt is important that those production and sustainment rates are improved,\u201d he added.",
      "AUKUS would grow the U.S. and Australian defense industries and generate thousands of manufacturing jobs, Marles said in a statement.",
      "John Lee, an Australian Indo-Pacific expert at Washington\u2019s conservative Hudson Institute think tank, said the Pentagon review was \u201cprimarily an audit of American capability\u201d and whether it can afford to sell up to five nuclear-powered submarines when it is not meeting its own production targets.",
      "\u201cRelatedly, the low Australian defense spending and ambiguity as to how it might contribute to a Taiwan contingency is also a factor,\u201d Lee said.",
      "John Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior Pentagon official, told a Lowy Institute seminar in Sydney on Thursday there is a perception in Washington that \u201cthe Albanese government has been supportive of AUKUS but not really leaning in on AUKUS,\u201d and that defense spending is part of this.",
      "Under the multi-stage pact, four U.S.-commanded Virginia submarines will be hosted at a Western Australian navy base on the Indian Ocean starting in 2027, which a senior U.S. Navy commander told Congress in April gives the U.S. a \u201cstraight shot to the South China Sea.\u201d",
      "Albanese wants to buy three Virginia submarines starting in 2032 to bring its submarine force under Australian command.",
      "Britain and Australia will jointly build a new AUKUS-class submarine that is expected to come into service starting in 2040. Following a recent defense review, Britain said it would boost spending on its attack submarine fleet under AUKUS.",
      "Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who struck the AUKUS deal with Biden, said Thursday that Australia should \u201cmake the case again\u201d for the treaty.",
      "AUKUS would build more submarines across the three partners and was \u201cfundamentally about strengthening collective deterrence, particularly in the Indo-Pacific against potential adversaries,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn."
