      "Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., amid a shift in priorities and the ousting of leadership at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.",
      "Multiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington\u2019s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\u201d said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. \u201cWe are finding another path to the celebration \u2026 but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\u201d",
      "The Kennedy Center\u2019s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.",
      "The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.",
      "The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month \u2014 running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.",
      "\u201cI know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\u201d said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center\u2019s programming.",
      "Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, \u201cWe are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey went from very eager to host to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that\u2019s not going to stop us.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.",
      "Monica Alford, a veteran event planner with a long history of working with the Kennedy Center, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Alford organized the first ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution \u2014 and its recent expansion known as The Reach \u2014 as \u201cmy home base\u201d and \u201ca safe space for the queer community\u201d",
      "She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as \u201cmeant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\u201d",
      "She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing our community a disservice \u2014 not just the queer community but the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.",
      "\u201cThere would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it is a hostile performance space.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A former roommate of one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers has testified the woman told her in July 2006 that the then-movie mogul had forcibly performed oral sex on her",
      "NEW YORK -- Hovering in the doorway of her roommate's bedroom one evening in July 2006, TV production assistant Miriam Haley said Harvey Weinstein \u2014 her boss \u2014 had forcibly performed oral sex on her, her then-roommate testified Thursday at the ex-movie mogul's retrial.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Miriam, that sounds like rape. I think you should call a lawyer,\u2019\u201d but a shaken Haley seemed disinclined to do so, recalled the ex-roommate, Elizabeth Entin.",
      "If secondhand, it was the first testimony jurors have gotten so far about any of the alleged sexual assaults at the heart of the retrial, which opened Wednesday. Haley and two other accusers are expected to testify later in the weekslong proceeding.",
      "Weinstein, 73, maintains that he has never sexually assaulted or raped anyone. His lawyers argue that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer in hopes of getting ahead in the entertainment business.",
      "Weinstein was transformed in 2017 from a Hollywood tycoon into the #MeToo movement's archvillain, after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public.",
      "He was convicted in 2020 of raping Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor, and sexually assaulting Haley, who worked on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway.\u201d But New York's highest court overturned his conviction last year, finding that the trial judge had allowed prejudicial testimony.",
      "The reversal led to the retrial, which includes an additional allegation of forcible oral sex on a different woman, former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "Entin was among the witnesses who are returning to the stand five years after testifying in the landmark #MeToo case. But prosecutors, some defense lawyers and the judge are different \u2014 and so are the contours of the testimony and evidence being elicited.",
      "For instance, this time Entin didn't give any details of what she said Haley told her about the alleged sexual assault.",
      "And Entin wasn't asked about a recollection that made for a memorable and rare light moment at the first trial \u2014 a time when she said Weinstein showed up uninvited and was chased around the women's apartment by Entin's pet Chihuahua.",
      "Farber had indicated he didn't think that having Entin describe the purported episode was fair game for the trial.",
      "In another measure of the looping trajectory of the case, Entin found herself testifying about what she has said and written about the first trial itself. The fashion startup founder and consultant has reflected on the case in a book, on podcasts and some interviews.",
      "Weinstein attorney Jennifer Bonjean confronted her with instances in which Entin referred to her participation in the first trial as her \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d and compared gearing up for testifying to preparing for battle.",
      "Entin responded tensely that being cross-examined was a form of \u201cvery civilized battle.\u201d",
      "The voluble Entin said that her writing style was sometimes \u201cmildly hyperbolic,\u201d but that she'd been describing how she girded herself for a daunting experience.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to be named. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "The Vietnam War cast a long shadow across one of the most fertile periods of American filmmaking, and has led filmmakers for the half-century since to reckon with its complicated legacy.",
      "These 10 films, assembled to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, range from indelible anti-war classics to Vietnamese portraits of resistance, capturing the vastness of the war\u2019s still-reverberating traumas.",
      "The war was more than a decade in and some eight years from its conclusion when a 25-year-old Martin Scorsese made this six-minute short. In it, a man simply shaves himself before a sink and a mirror. After a few knicks and cuts, he doesn\u2019t stop, continuing until his face is a bloody mess \u2014 a neat but gruesome metaphor to Vietnam.",
      "A young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searches for her family in the bombed-out ruins of Hanoi in H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark of Vietnamese cinema. It\u2019s a work of wartime propaganda (it begins with the intro: \u201chonoring the heroes of Hanoi who defeated the American imperialist B-52 bombing raid\u201d) but also of aching humanity. Set against the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi, \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d is cinema made in the very midst of war.",
      "Controversy greeted Peter Davis\u2019 landmark documentary around its release, but time has only proved how soberly clear-eyed it was. Newsreel clips and homefront interviews are contrasted with the horrors on the ground in Vietnam in this penetrating examination of the gulf between American policy and Vietnamese reality. Its title comes from President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s line, said when escalating the war, that \u201cthe ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.\u201d",
      "It's arguably the preeminent American film about the Vietnam War. No other movie more grandly or tragically charts the American evolution from innocence to disillusionment than Michael Cimino\u2019s devastating epic about working-class friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage) from a Pennsylvania steel town drafted into war. The final sing-along scene to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d after their lives have irrevocably changed, remains a powerfully poignant gut punch.",
      "Francis Ford Coppola wagered everything he had on his masterpiece \u2014 and nearly lost it. \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d which transposes Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d to the Vietnam War, is an epic of madness that teeters on the brink of hallucination. Shot in the Philippines and more faithful to Conrad than to Vietnam, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d doesn\u2019t so much illuminate the chaos and moral confusion of the war as elevate it to grandiose nightmare.",
      "The 1980s saw a wave of Hollywood films about Vietnam, including \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d \u201cHamburger Hill,\u201d \u201cGood Morning Vietnam,\u201d \u201cCasualties of War\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d Foremost among them is the Oscar best picture-winning \u201cPlatoon,\u201d which Oliver Stone wrote based on his own experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam. Widely acclaimed for its realism, Stone\u2019s film remains among the most intensely vivid and visceral dramatizations of the war.",
      "Stanley Kubrick should be more often thought of as the supreme anti-war moviemaker. His devastating World War I film \u201cPaths of Glory\u201d and the subversive satire \u201cDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\u201d are classics in their own right. \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d carries those films\u2019 themes of dehumanization into an even more brutal place. Split between the harrowing boot-camp tyranny of R. Lee Ermey\u2019s drill instructor and the urban violence of the 1968 Tet Offensive, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d fuses both ends of the war machine.",
      "How former soldiers lived with their experience in Vietnam has been a subject of many fine films, from Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) to Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d (2020). In Werner Herzog\u2019s nonfiction gem, he profiles the astonishing story of German-American pilot Dieter Dengler. In the film, which Herzog later remade as 2007\u2019s \u201cRescue Dawn\u201d with Christian Bale, Dengler recounts \u2014 and sometimes reenacts \u2014 his experience being shot down over Laos, being captured and tortured and then escaping into the jungle.",
      "Not long after the turn of the century, former U.S. defense secretary and Vietnam War architect Robert S. McNamara sat for interviews with documentarian Errol Morris. The result is a chilling reflection on the thinking that led to one of American\u2019s greatest follies. It\u2019s not a mea culpa but a thornier and more disquieting rumination on how rationalized ideology can lead to the deaths of millions \u2014 and still not yield an apology. Of McNamara\u2019s lessons, No. 1 is \u201cempathize with the enemy.\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s stirring film dramatizes the Washington Post\u2019s 1971 publishing of the Pentagon Papers, a collection of classified documents that chronicled America\u2019s 20-year involvement in Southeast Asia. While government analyst Daniel Ellsberg (a moving participant in \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d) could be considered the hero of this story, \u201cThe Post\u201d turns its focus to Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) and the wartime role of the Fourth Estate.",

      "If you wanted to find the Vietnam War in American television shows, you mostly had to wait until it was long over",
      "The evening news brought the Vietnam War into American living rooms, but once the news was over, so was the war. Prime-time shows brought nary a mention of it as networks looked to bring uncontroversial content to the broadest possible audience. But the war simmered below the surface as subtext, and when enough years passed, television would finally take it on as a subject.",
      "\u201cGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\u201d premiered on CBS six weeks after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized U.S. combat troops in Vietnam, and the daft comedy was among the chief images of the military in American homes through the peak of U.S. involvement in 1969. Naturally, the show about a country rube in the Marine Corps never directly mentioned the war. But most of the real-life Marines who marched in its introduction would soon be fighting in Vietnam. Star Jim Nabors later said watching that intro was difficult, knowing some of those men had died.",
      "It would take \u201cAll in the Family\u201d to bring the war into prime-time discourse. The Norman Lear-created CBS comedy owed its popularity to timely political bickering between cantankerous patriarch Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) and his liberal-minded son-in-law Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic (Rob Reiner). Vietnam was the sole subject of a landmark 1976 episode where a draft-dodging fugitive friend of Michael\u2019s comes to Christmas dinner, and an explosive argument ensues. \u201cWhen the hell are you going to admit that the war was wrong?!\u201d Michael shouts. A friend of Archie\u2019s whose son died in the war shocks him by taking his son-in-law\u2019s side.",
      "Set in the Korean War of the early 1950s, \u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d the CBS dramedy about wisecracking U.S. Army doctors, was among the most popular shows in the country during the Vietnam War\u2019s final years. It was heavy with anti-military, anti-war sentiment, evoking the zeitgeist of a Vietnam-exhausted populace. \u201cWar isn\u2019t Hell,\u201d Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, says in a typical line. \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders in Hell, but war is chock full of them.\u201d (The Robert Altman film the show stemmed from deliberately minimized references to Korea to maximize its unspoken commentary on Vietnam.)",
      "Television's first regular portrayal of Vietnam veterans came in the form of a cartoonish crew of daring mercenaries that reflected the era of Reagan and Rambo. NBC\u2019s \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d whose members included a mohawked-and-gold-chained Mr. T and a cigar-chomping George Peppard, were a \u201ccrack commando unit\u201d who were innocent fugitives from military justice and worked as mercenaries pulling off weekly capers. Explosions and jumping cars abounded. In a fourth-season episode, the team returns to Vietnam for a job. Peppard\u2019s Hannibal momentarily struggles with dark war memories before getting back to the lighthearted action.",
      "HBO aired and helped organize a 1987 charity concert dubbed \u201cWelcome Home\u201d that billed itself as the warm celebration Vietnam War veterans never got upon their return. Performers included James Brown, Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder. The July Fourth concert was not a militaristic affair, and had a hate-the-war, love-the-troops vibe. Some of the most anti-war songs of the \u201960s were performed by artists like John Fogerty and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The event would be a harbinger of a wave of cultural nostalgia and reckoning as baby boomers began turning 40 and were in the mood to reflect.",
      "With \u201cTour of Duty,\u201d the Vietnam War finally came to prime time. The CBS series that premiered in 1987 showed actual combat and the young men who fought and died in it. It might have been called \u201cPlatoon: The Series,\u201d after the Vietnam film that had just won best picture at the Oscars. Surprisingly gory and gritty for a network show, it had all the hallmarks of the era\u2019s many Vietnam movies. But executives seeking lower costs and higher ratings \u2014 which never came \u2014 eventually moved production from Hawaii to California and introduced romances and soapy plotlines typical of TV dramas.",
      "And suddenly, there were two Vietnam series on TV. ABC\u2019s \u201cChina Beach\u201d was part-\u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d part-\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d part-\u201cMad Men.\u201d Set in a wartime evacuation hospital \u2014 the title was the Americans\u2019 nickname for My Khe Beach in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng \u2014 it focused on Army medics and civilians. It was festooned with \u201960s songs whose copyrights have kept the series off streaming services. Beloved by critics, \u201cChina Beach\u201d made a star and a best-actress Emmy winner of Dana Delany, but never found a mass audience. With its cancellation, network TV depictions of the war would disappear for years.",
      "\u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d was baby boomer nostalgia in its purest form. The ABC series, narrated by an adult Kevin Arnold (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a child by Fred Savage), depicts his boyhood feelings and experiences with the backing of sentimental \u201960s songs. The specter of Vietnam dominates its first season, which sees Kevin\u2019s hero \u2014 the big brother of his neighbor and crush Winnie Cooper \u2014 die in the war. In a 2021 reboot, the story shifts to a Black family in Alabama, with narrator Dean Williams\u2019 brother a returning Vietnam vet who faces racism at home.",
      "The NBC miniseries \u201cThe \u201960s\u201d was a roundup of the decade\u2019s cliches that by then had been well-established in movies and TV. The 1999 two-night event was billed as \u201cthe movie event of a generation.\u201d Its subjects were three Chicago siblings who each go on very 1960s journeys. For Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s high-school quarterback character, that meant serving in Vietnam. He enlists in a gung-ho moment, but by the show\u2019s second night, he\u2019s back home with an Army jacket and long hair, drinking to bury his trauma. The show drew a big audience at a time when NBC was ratings king.",
      "The time-hopping, tear-jerking NBC family drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d used the Vietnam War to delve into the psyche of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), who refused to talk about his experience as a soldier with his wife and kids before his premature death. In dual plotlines that run through its third season, with the emotional themes and folk-acoustic soundtrack that are hallmarks of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Jack is shown enlisting to try to protect his drafted younger brother. Decades later, his son Kevin (Justin Hartley) travels to Vietnam to find out what happened to his father and uncle.",
      "In a docuseries that ran over 10 nights on PBS, the Vietnam War got the same hallowed treatment Ken Burns brought nearly 30 years earlier to the Civil War. Burns and Lynn Novick's \u201cThe Vietnam War\" was not as soft or sentimental as his reputation might have suggested. It was a rare PBS show with a TV-MA rating, and its tone, with a modern soundtrack from composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matched the messiness of the conflict. The show went to lengths to include a North Vietnamese perspective along with American and South Vietnamese vets and historians.",
      "It took until 2024 before a fictional television show would attempt a Vietnamese perspective of the war\u2019s end and its aftermath, though it brought mixed reactions from Vietnamese American viewers. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d was based on Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The first two episodes of the black-comic limited series depict a harrowing flight during the fall of Saigon. Actors of Vietnamese descent played most of its main roles, including lead Hoa Xuande. But much of the attention given to it \u2014 and its only Emmy nomination \u2014 went to Robert Downey Jr. for his portrayal of four different white American men.",

      "Emphasizing the former studio boss's onetime influence in the movie industry, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said Weinstein used \u201cdream opportunities as weapons\u201d to prey on the three accusers in the case. He is charged with raping one and forcing oral sex on the other two.",

      "The jury counts seven women and five men \u2014 unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 \u2014 and there's a different judge.",
      "The #MeToo movement, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has also evolved and ebbed.",
      "At the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, chants of \u201crapist\u201d could be heard from protesters outside.",
      "TV trucks lined the street, and reporters queued for hours to get a seat in the packed courtroom. His lawyers decried the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d and fought unsuccessfully to get the trial moved from Manhattan.",
      "This time, over five days of jury selection, there was none of that.",
      "Those realities, coupled with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling last year vacating his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence \u2014 because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with \u2014 are shaping everything from retrial legal strategy to the atmosphere in court.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor, Jessica Mann, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. Prosecutors said that the woman, who hasn\u2019t been named publicly, came forward days before his first trial but wasn\u2019t part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.",
      "The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial \u2014 predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Lindsay Goldbrum, a lawyer for the unnamed accuser, said Weinstein\u2019s retrial marks a \u201cpivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases\u201d and a \u201csignal to other survivors that the system is catching up \u2014 and that it\u2019s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.\u201d",
      "This time around, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting Weinstein through its Special Victims Division, which specializes in such cases, after homicide veterans helmed the 2020 version. At the same time, Weinstein has added several lawyers to his defense team \u2014 including Jennifer Bonjean, who is involved in appealing his 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. She helped Bill Cosby get his conviction overturned and defended R. Kelly in his sex crimes case.",
      "\u201cThis trial is not going to be all about #MeToo. It\u2019s going to be about the facts of what took place,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, said recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big deal. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d",
      "But there has already been some talk of #MeToo. A prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way.",
      "Others went further.",
      "A woman opined that \u201cnot enough has been done\u201d as a result of #MeToo. A man explained that he had negative feelings about it because his high school classmates had been falsely accused of sexual assault.",
      "Another man said he viewed #MeToo like other social movements: \u201cIt\u2019s a pendulum. It swings way one way, then way the other way, and then it settles.\u201d",
      "None of them is on the jury.",

      "The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal history and what it has taken to overcome it",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Board of Parole on Tuesday recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal record and what it has taken to overcome it. The board's action leaves the final decision on a pardon up to Gov. Bill Lee.",
      "The rapper-turned-country singer wants to be able to travel internationally to perform and share his message of redemption, after spending time behind bars as a young person.",
      "The board issued its nonbinding recommendation unanimously after a hearing that lasted about an hour and 45 minutes with several witnesses, including Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall, advocating for the 40-year-old musician named Jason DeFord. One board member recused themselves from voting.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \u201cWhitsitt Chapel\u201d and crossover songs like \u201cNeed a Favor.\u201d He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and earned four Grammy nominations, including for new artist of the year.",
      "\u201cThis was incredible,\u201d he said of the board's decision. \u201cI pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.\u201d",
      "His most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two other young men enter a house in 2002. Both of the others were carrying guns, although Jelly Roll was unarmed. They demanded money, and received $350 and a wallet with no money in it. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. He was sentenced to serve a year in prison and additional time on probation.",
      "Later, in 2008, police on patrol found both marijuana and crack cocaine in his car. He was sentenced to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "He also has two misdemeanor offenses for driving without a license and possession of drug paraphernalia.",
      "Lee, a Republican, said every case seeking clemency, such as pardons, is equally important and goes through a thorough process.",
      "\u201cThe reporting on Jelly Roll, that\u2019s encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Jelly Roll told the board that while in a detention center, he fell in love with songwriting. \u201cIt started as a passion project that felt therapeutic and would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable and opened doors that I\u2019ve never thought possible.\u201d",
      "These days, he often visits jails and rehabilitation centers before performing concerts. He has bought restaurants out for the day to feed people who are homeless and played basketball with kids at a youth center the same day that he performed in Winnipeg. He said he generally doesn't seek out news coverage when he makes these visits.",
      "As a part of the pardon application, friends and civic leaders wrote to the board about Jelly Roll\u2019s transformation and generosity. Hall, who runs Nashville\u2019s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino also wrote in his favor, pointing out all the money he's given from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "One of the reasons Jelly Roll gave for needing a pardon is to be able to travel to Canada to perform, which his criminal record makes difficult. Currently, he would need to apply for a special permit that can include long wait times for a decision, according to a letter from an immigration attorney submitted with his clemency packet.",
      "\u201cI want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be \u2014 to let them know that change is truly possible,\" Jelly Roll told the board. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I\u2019m looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith through the rest of the world.\u201d",
      "He said he would use the pardon for much more than going on tour, though.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll still be using this same pardon, God willing, to go do missionary work in my 50s and 60s,\u201d he said.",
      "Due to his criminal record, he told the board that every time he travels it \u201ctakes a team of lawyers and a mountain of paperwork to secure my entry into those countries.\u201d He said he recently was able to make his first tour in Canada and took his first trip to the United Kingdom, where he spoke about a rehabilitation program.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks at least five years since his sentence expired.",
      "Lee has issued more than 90 pardons since taking office in 2019, all of them since 2021.",

      "After a dayslong selection process yielded a seven-woman, five-man jury and five alternate jurors by Monday, prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers finished choosing a sixth and final alternate on Tuesday. Alternates step in if a member of the main panel can\u2019t see the trial through.",
      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago. The verdict marked a signature moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, which had been fueled in 2017 by a slew of allegations against Weinstein, then a high-flying movie producer of a string of Oscar winners including \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d",
      "But in a reversal that dismayed #MeToo activists, New York\u2019s highest court last year overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence. The court found that the original trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony. That judge\u2019s term expired in 2022, and he is no longer on the bench.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Drawn from Manhattan\u2019s jury pool, the 12 members of the main jury for the New York retrial include a physics researcher, a photographer, a dietitian, a therapist, an investment bank software engineer and a fire safety director. Others have experience in real estate, TV commercials, debt collection, social work and other fields.",
      "One has a high school equivalency degree. Others have master\u2019s degrees. Some have served as jurors or grand jurors multiple times before; others, never.",
      "Hundreds of other potential jurors were excused for reasons ranging from language barriers to strong opinions about Weinstein \u2014 \u201cthe first word that came in my head was \u2018pig,\u2019\u201d said one man who was soon let go.",
      "Those chosen were quizzed about their backgrounds, life experiences and various other points that could relate to their ability to be fair and impartial about the highly publicized case.",
      "\u201cYou may hear sexual allegations here of a salacious nature \u2014 graphic, perhaps. Would hearing that indicate that \u2026 Mr. Weinstein must be guilty?\u201d defense attorney Mike Cibella asked one prospective juror on Monday. The woman, who ultimately was chosen, answered no.",
      "Prosecutor Shannon Lucey sought assurances that prospective jurors could put aside any position or feelings they had about the #MeToo movement.",
      "\u201cIs there anyone who is going to think of the movement and think, \u2018OK, that\u2019s just something that I have to keep in the back of my mind when I\u2019m deciding this case\u2019? Everyone can put that aside?\u201d Lucey asked a group of 24 possible jurors. All indicated they could do so.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s rape and sexual assault retrial involves accusations from three women: an aspiring actor who said he raped her in 2013, and two women who made separate allegations of forced oral sex in 2006. One of the two wasn\u2019t part of the original trial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is challenging a separate 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films.",
      "The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Monday announced that members will from now on be required to watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round of Oscar voting. Up until now, Oscar voters had only been encouraged to watch the nominees, and vote in categories they felt qualified in.",
      "But in recent years, what films get watched by academy members has been increasingly seen as a significant factor in what wins. At the same time, the publication of anonymous Oscar ballots has often featured members confessing that they didn't get around to watching some notable films or not finishing lengthier nominees.",
      "On Monday, the academy also put forth a handful of new regulations on issues including AI, refugee filmmakers and the newly launched casting category.",
      "In the best international film category, the academy will now allow filmmakers with refugee or asylum status to be represented by a country not their own. The rule change keeps in place the broad apparatus of how international nominees are submitted through countries, but it tweaks eligibility.",
      "The regulation now reads: \u201cThe submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.\u201d",
      "Critics have long called on changes to the nominating process for best international film because it leaves the submission process in the hands of governments, not the academy. That's left dissident filmmakers working under authoritarian or undemocratic regimes with limited pathways to reaching the Oscars.",
      "Last year, for instance, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years in order to release his film \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig.\u201d Germany, where Rasoulof settled, submitted it for the Oscars and it was nominated. But other filmmakers, including Rasoulof's friend and countryman Jafar Panahi, have released films without a mechanism for submission.",
      "The rule change notably won't alter the Oscar prospects for filmmakers who haven't fled their home countries or change anything for films passed over by their nation's selection committees.",
      "The academy also ruled that the use of generative artificial intelligence tools \u201cneither help nor harm the chances of a nomination.\u201d How significantly AI is used in filmmaking has, as in other industries, been a much-debated topic in Hollywood. In this year's Oscar race, Brady Corbet's \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was a subject of some controversy after its editor said that AI had been used to enhance the Hungarian dialogue of stars Adrien Brody (who ultimately won best actor ) and Felicity Jones (who was nominated for best supporting actress).",
      "\u201cThe academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,\u201d the academy said Monday.",
      "The film academy also set down some rules for its new achievement in casting Oscar. After a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, members of the casting branch will be invited to a \u201cbake-off\u201d presentation from the shortlisted films, including a Q&A with nominees.",
      "Earlier in April, the academy announced a new category for stunt design, but that award won't begin until the 2028 Oscars.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite beautiful and idealistic also, like a revolution has to be, It\u2019s a great reminder of how romantic the idea of revolution is,\u201d Luna said.",
      "Cast members say it can feel revolutionary working for Gilroy, who passes on the same freedom to them that Disney gives to him. They're never kept in the dark with the sort of script-rationing and secret-keeping that are the norm in major franchises.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in withholding information as power,\u201d said Adria Arjona, who plays Andor's partner Bix Caleen. \u201cBefore I read episode one, I knew the end. It\u2019s just unheard-of.\u201d",
      "Her character's arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything \u201cStar Wars\u201d has shown before.",
      "Gilroy said he didn't have to fight over the galaxy's canon at all. He had to get used to certain elements when he first worked within the franchise \u2014 no paper, no hinged doors, no knives, for example. But it's not necessarily held as sacred.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen canon stretch so much,\" he said. \"It was really tight on \u2018Rogue.\u2019 But a lot of things have changed since then.\u201d",

      "\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing with Cassian,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI know that the first year is the making of a revolutionary and the road to Damascus, that\u2019s the first year, I know I\u2019m leading to Rogue, I know where he\u2019s gonna end up.\"",
      "Other elements, like the route Mon Mothma (Genevieve O\u2019Reilly) takes from respectable senator to leader of the rebellion, were not predetermined. They were discovered in the writing and in the performances.",
      "Her early-season path includes a wedding ceremony full of rituals \u2014 and dances \u2014 new to \u201cStar Wars\u201d that Gilroy invented out of whole cloth. He said one of the pleasures of getting to make something so large and sprawling is that he has gotten to use nearly every writing thought he has had.",
      "\u201cAll I did for five years was just max out my imagination,\" Gilroy said.",
      "Mothma is among the \u201cRogue One\u201d characters who appeared in the first season and return for the second, along with Forest Whittaker's radical rebel Saw Gerrera, who this season gives a spine-tingling call to arms that is teased in the trailer: \u201cRevolution,\" he preaches to an underling, \"is not for the sane!\u201d",
      "Season 2 also sees the emergence of \u201cRogue One\u201d characters for the first time in the TV series, including Andor's droid sidekick K-250, played by Alan Tudyk, and Death Star builder Orson Krennic, played by Ben Mendelsohn.",

Jordans, proved a bloody exception to modern movie rules, launching with $45.6 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d a Warner Bros. release that cost about $90 million to produce, was a bold gamble on originality \u2014 albeit with genre elements \u2014 and one of the most bankable American directors in Coogler. The \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director wrote and produced \u201cSinners,\u201d a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the year\u2019s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release.

      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which Warner Bros. co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has amassed $720.8 million worldwide in three weeks of release.",
      "Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, co-chairs of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, celebrated the two films\u2019 resonance with moviegoers. The studio accounted for a remarkable 64% of the domestic box office for the Easter weekend.",

Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,\u201d Abdy and De Luca said in a statement Sunday.",
      "But all eyes were on the performance on \u201cSinners,\u201d which Warner Bros. went to extreme lengths to secure. Abdy and De Luca agreed to give Coogler not just a cut of gross ticket sales but ownership of the film after 25 years \u2014 a virtually unheard of concession.",
      "But Coogler and Jordan, whose collaborations stretch back to \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d make up one of the industry\u2019s most potent director-actor duos. Reviews (98% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for \u201cSinners\u201d and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.",
      "Overseas, \u201cSinners\u201d faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, \u201cSinners\u201d attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian.",
      "Before \u201cSinners,\u201d dual roles had been rough business for Warner Bros. The studio saw flops in both \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d (a period gangster film featuring a doubled Robert De Niro) and \u201cMickey 17\u201d (a sci-fi movie with two Robert Pattinsons).",
      "But the strong opening for \u201cSinners,\u201d which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler\u2019s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences.

      "San Francisco has moved closer to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Reeling from drug overdose deaths and scenes of people smoking fentanyl on sidewalks, San Francisco moved closer Thursday to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal, a proposal that has prompted heated debate in the city that pioneered harm reduction.",
      "Opponents of Supervisor Matt Dorsey's proposal say its emphasis on stopping drug use alienates those who are not ready to quit, while proponents say the city has been far too permissive and making drug use safer does not help break the cycle of addiction.",
      "Dorsey, himself recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, amended the proposal in his public safety committee to clarify that distributing safer-use paraphernalia and linking people to social services regardless of whether they are using remain critical to the city's response.",
      "But more than an hour of public comment with cheers and boos from both sides underscored just how touchy the issue remains.",
      "\u201cNo one dies from harm reduction,\u201d Patt Denning said. \u201cPeople die from conventional abstinence-based treatments because they\u2019re either left out or kicked out if they don\u2019t comply with abstinence.\u201d",
      "Brendan Harris, who said he has been clean for six years, countered that harm reduction tactics cannot go on forever and people need a firm if compassionate push into treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep enabling drugs over and over again,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years San Francisco's public health department advised people who use drugs to do so with friends to try to prevent overdose deaths. Critics said that sent the wrong message.",
      "Mayor Daniel Lurie, who took office in January, has vowed to solve the city's fentanyl crisis. Last year more than 600 people died from accidental overdoses.",
      "He ordered city-funded nonprofits to offer treatment or counseling options before giving out certain paraphernalia such as foil and pipes, and they will no longer be allowed to distribute those items in parks and on sidewalks.",
      "As amended, Dorsey's proposal states that the \u201clong-term remission of substance use disorders for individuals, with the help of fully supported and staffed evidence-based recovery and behavioral health services, shall be the primary goal.\u201d",
      "It also defines recovery as \u201cthe process by which an individual suffering from substance use disorder strives to make positive changes that become part of a voluntarily adopted healthy lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Dorsey said aspiring to live a healthy life free from illicit drug use should not be a controversial goal, and abstention can mean receiving methadone as part of a medication assisted treatment program. San Francisco offers an array of services to help people addicted to drugs, but many residents only see the free foil and pipes, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're losing the battle on harm reduction when people think that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said after the hearing.",
      "The San Francisco Marin Medical Society, which represents more than 3,500 physicians, proposed the amendments.",
      "The full Board of Supervisors votes on the proposal next month. It is expected to pass, with seven of the 11 members sponsoring or cosponsoring.",

      "The Agriculture Department says it is withdrawing a plan to limit salmonella bacteria in poultry products",
      "The Agriculture Department will not require poultry companies to limit salmonella bacteria in their products, halting a Biden Administration effort to prevent food poisoning from contaminated meat.",
      "The department on Thursday said it was withdrawing a rule proposed in August after three years of development. Officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service cited feedback from more than 7,000 public comments and said they would \u201cevaluate whether it should update\u201d current salmonella regulations.",
      "The rule would have required poultry companies to keep levels of salmonella bacteria under a certain threshold and test for the presence of six strains most associated with illness, including three found in turkey and three in chicken. If the levels exceeded the standard or any of those strains were found, the poultry couldn\u2019t be sold and would be subject to recall, the proposal had said.",
      "The plan aimed to reduce an estimated 125,000 salmonella infections from chicken and 43,000 from turkey each year, according to USDA. Overall, salmonella causes 1.35 million infections a year, most through food, and about 420 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The withdrawal drew praise from the National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, which said the proposed rule was legally unsound, misinterpreted science, would have increased costs and create more food waste, all \u201cwith no meaningful impact on public health.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to further reducing salmonella and fully support food safety regulations and policies that are based on sound science,\u201d said Ashley Peterson, the group's senior vice president of science and regulatory affairs.",
      "But the move drew swift criticism from food safety advocates, including Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who helped draft the plan.",
      "The withdrawal \"sends the clear message that the Make America Healthy Again initiative does not care about the thousands of people who get sick from preventable foodborne salmonella infections linked to poultry,\" Eskin said in a statement.",
      "The proposed rule had been regarded as a food safety victory similar to a 1994 decision to ban certain strains of dangerous E. coli bacteria from ground beef after deadly outbreaks, said Sarah Sorscher, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Shipping more salmonella to restaurants and grocery stores is certain to make Americans sicker,\u201d Sorscher said.",
      "Earlier this month, the USDA said it would delay by six months the enforcement of a final rule regulating salmonella levels in certain breaded and stuffed raw chicken products. Enforcement, which was set for May 1, now begins Nov. 3.",
      "That covers foods such as frozen chicken cordon bleu and chicken Kiev dishes that appear to be fully cooked but are only heat-treated to set the batter or coating. Such products have been linked to at least 14 salmonella outbreaks and at least 200 illnesses since 1998, according to the CDC.",

      "\u201cEven people who didn\u2019t have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events,\u201d said Jennifer Dragonette, a California-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties.",
      "U.S. air travel was down in March and early April compared with last year, according to TSA statistics. Airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and \u2014 yes \u2014 concern about recent aviation incidents.",
      "FAA officials recently acknowledged they weren\u2019t doing enough to ensure air safety. Recent polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying this year.",
      "Flight attendants who work planes out of the Washington, D.C., airport were particularly rattled by the January collision, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. Some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said.",
      "Fear of flying \u2014 sometimes called aerophobia \u2014 goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. It is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. Many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane.",
      "Some research has suggested it affects about 25 million U.S. adults. Psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didn\u2019t mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged.",
      "In many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities \u2014 like getting married or becoming a parent \u2014 and they start to think that \u201ceverything counts,\u201d said David Carbonell, a Chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears.",
      "A bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said.",
      "Campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. She is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how she\u2019ll be treated by airport security or in other interactions.",
      "Aerophobia can be complicated, Carbonell said. For many people, it\u2019s not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control.",
      "Campbell said that\u2019s what she experiences: \u201cfeeling trapped and unable to breathe.\u201d",
      "Nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had people have panic attacks, and we\u2019ve had to give them oxygen. It can be quite intense.\u201d",
      "Statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics \u2014 making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.",
      "But experts say you can\u2019t really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder.",
      "Carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients: \u201cI know you already looked at them all, and they\u2019re not helping you.\u201d",
      "For people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. Longer exhales help the body relax, said Dragonette, who counseled Campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a Newport Healthcare residential facility in Temecula, California.",
      "People suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. It can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, Dragonette said.",
      "It\u2019s a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them.",
      "Carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. When they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a simple count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using counting as a proxy for acceptance.\u201d",
      "Nelson, who was a longtime United Airlines flight attendant, says: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019d sort of sit in the aisle and hold someone\u2019s hand.\"",
      "On a Frontier Airlines flight last year from Detroit to San Diego, Campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didn\u2019t halt her panic attack. The passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant.",
      "The flight attendant took deep breaths with Campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down Campbell\u2019s phone number and checked on her a day later.",
      "\u201cI was really impressed,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Health officials in the Gaza Strip say more than 400 dialysis patients have died during the 18-month Israel-Hamas war because of lack of proper treatment",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Twice a week, Mohamed Attiya\u2019s wheelchair rattles over Gaza\u2019s scarred roads so he can visit the machine that is keeping him alive.",
      "The 54-year-old makes the journey from a temporary shelter west of Gaza City to Shifa Hospital in the city\u2019s north. There, he receives dialysis for the kidney failure he was diagnosed with nearly 15 years ago. But the treatment, limited by the war's destruction and lack of supplies, is not enough to remove all the waste products from his blood.",
      "\u201cIt just brings you back from death,\u201d the father of six said.",
      "Many others like him have not made it. They are some of Gaza\u2019s quieter deaths from the war, with no explosion, no debris. But the toll is striking: Over 400 patients, representing around 40% of all dialysis cases in the territory, have died during the 18-month conflict because of lack of proper treatment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "That includes 11 patients who have died since the beginning of March, when Israel sealed the territory's 2 million Palestinians off from all imports, including food, medical supplies and fuel. Israeli officials say the aim is to pressure Hamas to release more hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid, declined to comment on the current blockade. It has said in the past that all medical aid is approved for entry when the crossings are open, and that around 45,400 tons of medical equipment have entered Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",
      "\u201cThe displacement has had consequences,\u201d Kamel said. \u201cI am tired.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says his agency will be providing Mexico a list to complete to stop the flow of sewage from Tijuana",
      "SAN DIEGO -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that Mexico must stop the flow of billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana that has polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water.",
      "Lee Zeldin made the demand during an Earth Day trip to the California-Mexico border, where he toured a plant in San Diego County that treats the sewage as a secondary facility and flew along the frontier to see the Tijuana River. He also was scheduled to meet with SEALs.",
      "Zeldin said that in the next day or so, his agency will present Mexico a to-do list of projects to resolve the decades-long environmental crisis, but he stopped short of specifying how the Trump administration would hold Mexico accountable if it does not act.",
      "The problem is \u201ctop of mind\u201d for President Donald Trump, Zeldin said, while adding that they have not talked about possibly imposing tariffs if nothing is done.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to know whether or not Mexico is going to do its part to resolve it, and then we\u2019ll go from there, as far as strategy and tactics,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Alicia B\u00e1rcena, Mexico's Environment and Natural Resources secretary, said her country also wants to resolve the problem. She met with Zeldin the previous evening and said they made progress in finding solutions.",
      "\u201cWe are here because we want to solve this,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said in a statement in Spanish. \u201cNot only so there is no untreated wastewater on Mexican beaches, but in the United States as well.\u201d",
      "The 120-mile (195 km)-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana\u2019s wastewater treatment plants have aged and its population and industry have boomed, an increasing amount of toxins have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who do not even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "The Navy is reviewing whether to relocate its training site for SEAL candidates after the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses of its recruits from 2019 to 2023.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020 more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin said. He added that he and Trump are hopeful that will change under the relatively new administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October.",
      "Zeldin said that after meeting with Mexico officials in San Diego for 90 minutes, he was left with the impression that Sheinbaum and her environmental secretary want to have a \u201cstrong collaborative relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s being communicated by the new Mexican president is an intense desire to fully resolve this situation,\u201d Zeldin said. But he made clear that he wants Mexico to step up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that we are going to stand before the people of California and ask them to have more patience and just bear with all of us as we go through the next 10 or 20 or 30 years of being stuck in 12 feet of raw sewage and not getting anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are all out of patience.\u201d",
      "Flanked by lawmakers from both parties, Zeldin noted that cleanup efforts have rare bipartisan support.",
      "Zeldin visited the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was built with funds from both countries to treat 25 million gallons per day as a secondary plant on the U.S. side.",
      "Mexico is working on several wastewater treatment projects to reduce the flow and make major upgrades to its existing plants. B\u00e1rcena said the now-repaired San Antonio de los Buenos plant, which went back to operating at full capacity this month, should make a difference.",
      "But Zeldin said Mexico must complete a number of other projects, including installing floodgates to collect trash in Tijuana. Another one being considered would divert 10 million gallons of sewage away from the shore.",

      "The state began selling its own generic version of Narcan last year for $24 per twin-pack to businesses and local governments, and will now also sell to individual consumers online. A box containing two doses of naloxone nasal spray costs between $45 and $70 from regular pharmacies and online marketplaces.",
      "Opioid overdose deaths, which are caused by heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone, have increased dramatically in California and across the country in recent years, reaching 7,847 in the state in 2023. But California officials say they have started to see a decline in these deaths.",
      "The move is part of a broader push by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to try to force drug companies to lower their prices by offering cheaper, competing versions of medication under the state's CalRx label.",
      "\u201cLife-saving medications shouldn\u2019t come with a life-altering price tag. CalRx is about making essential drugs like naloxone affordable and accessible for all \u2014 not the privileged few,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Naloxone, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, has been available in the U.S. without a prescription since March of 2023, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Narcan, a nasal spray brand produced by the Maryland-based pharmaceutical company Emergent BioSolutions.",
      "California is also working on a plan to make insulin more affordable for residents. The state has an agreement with the nonprofit Civica to produce CalRx-branded insulin used to treat diabetes.",

      "De Meyer runs a program in the southern African country of Namibia that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like ADHD and autism.",
      "Each weekday morning, de Meyer's dusty paddock just outside the capital, Windhoek, is enlivened by a group of eight to 10 children from one of the special schools she helps. The children ride the horses, groom them, stroke them and often, de Meyer says, talk to them.",
      "De Meyer grew up on a farm surrounded by horses and they've always been part of her life. She said they have a quality that is invaluable: They don't judge the children, no matter how different they are.",
      "\u201cThe horse is the hero in this whole situation because these kids don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people,\" de Meyer said.",
      "De Meyer's program, \"Enabling Through the Horse,\" is supported by the Namibian Equestrian Federation and won an award last year from the International Equestrian Federation because it \u201cunderlines the wonderful characteristics of the horse in exuding sensitivity and intuition.\u201d",
      "Horse therapy has been promoted by autism groups and those that work with children with learning disabilities as having a positive impact. And animal therapy in general has been found to be useful in many instances, like dogs that help military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and therapy cats that are taken to hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Some survivors of the devastating 2023 Hawaii wildfires found relief in horse therapy while grieving loved ones they had lost.",
      "De Meyer jokes she has \u201ctwo-and-a-half horses.\u201d These include two Arabians \u2014 a white mare named Faranah and a brown gelding, Lansha \u2014 while the \u201chalf\u201d is a miniature horse called Bonzi, who is about head-high for a 5-year-old.",
      "The Arabians are often the most useful for the children's therapy because of their size, de Meyer said.",
      "\u201cIt gives them self-esteem. When they stroke the horse, the therapy starts because this is a very big animal compared to their height, and they are not scared to stroke the horse ... and then to ride it and tell the horse what they want,\u201d she said.",
      "De Meyer works with children with a range of conditions or disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Down syndrome, those who are nonverbal or touch sensitive, and some who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome and have developmental problems.",
      "She has received interest from other countries in Africa and Asia to start similar programs there.",
      "\u201cThe changes that I\u2019ve seen with the learners are significant,\u201d said Chriszell Louw, a teacher at Dagbreek School, which says it is one of just two government schools in Namibia for children with intellectual disabilities. \u201cWe have a learner that likes to talk a lot. When we come here, she knows she has to keep quiet. She sits in her place.\u201d",
      "\"Some of them you see they are more open, they are happy. Some of them were very scared when they started with the horse riding but now they are very excited. When they hear we\u2019re going to the horses they are very excited and just want to go by themselves,\u201d Louw said.",
      "De Meyer said her program helps with fine-motor skills, gross-motor skills, muscle strengthening, coordination, balance and posture, all important for kids who struggle to sit at a desk at school and learn.",
      "One simple exercise de Meyer has children do when they ride is to let go of the reins and stretch their arms out straight and to the sides, using only their torso and lower body to balance as a groom leads the horse around the paddock.",
      "Some of the kids break out in smiles when they let go and look like they're soaring.",

      "Amazon expects to offer same-day prescription deliveries to nearly half of its U.S. customers by the end of this year. It\u2019s adding 20 small pharmacies to distribution centers around the country to improve delivery speeds.",
      "Separately, the company also has opened 10 prescription processing centers in the past few years. It can do same-day deliveries from those as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,\u201d Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall.",
      "The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists.",
      "Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items.",
      "It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour.",
      "Customer demand drove Walmart\u2019s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company.",
      "Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window.",
      "\u201cThis is just elevating that level of convenience,\u201d he said.",
      "Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine.",
      "McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has \u201cbig plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.\u201d",
      "Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more.",
      "Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly.",
      "People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp.",
      "\u201cThe practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,\u201d he said.",
      "Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies.",
      "Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store.",
      "Plus, some people just prefer going to drugstores. Don Watson says he might consider prescription deliveries \u201cmaybe 10 years from now when I\u2019m not able to do it myself.\u201d",
      "The 72-year-old Indianapolis resident said as he left a Walgreens store recently that he has no problem picking up prescriptions.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met briefly Saturday before the funeral for Pope Francis as the American leader steps up the pressure to end Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s office had said teams were making arrangements for the leaders to talk again Saturday, but Trump went directly to the Rome airport after the funeral and boarded Air Force One for the 10-hour flight back to the United States, which seemed to rule out a second in-person conversation.",
      "The White House said their discussion was \u201cvery productive\u201d and that more details would be released later. The meeting lasted about 15 minutes inside St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the Vatican just before they took their seats for the outdoor funeral service.",
      "Zelenskyy said \u201cgood meeting\u201d on social media after the funeral.",
      "\u201cWe discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out,\u201d he wrote. \u201cVery symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results. Thank you.\"",
      "The meeting took place hours after Trump said on social media, after he arrived in Italy late Friday, that Russia and Ukraine should meet for \u201cvery high level talks\u201d on ending the three-year war sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Trump has pressed both sides to agree to a ceasefire. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, had met earlier Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and Trump said both sides were \u201cvery close to a deal.\u201d",
      "Putin did not attend Francis' funeral. He faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, which has accused him of war crimes stemming from Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Meanwhile, in a statement Friday night, Zelenskyy said \u201cvery significant meetings may take place\u201d in coming days, and that an unconditional ceasefire was needed.",
      "\u201cReal pressure on Russia is needed so that they accept either the American proposal to cease fire and move towards peace, or our proposal \u2014 whichever one can truly work and ensure a reliable, immediate, and unconditional ceasefire, and then \u2014 a dignified peace and security guarantees,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cDiplomacy must succeed. And we are doing everything to make diplomacy truly meaningful and finally effective.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate word on whether Trump and Zelenskyy spoke again after they paid their respects to the pope, who had repeatedly pressed for an end to the conflict.",

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- The number of injured from an explosion Saturday at a port in southern Iran jumped to 281, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "IRNA quoted Mojtaba Khaledi, the spokesman of Iran\u2019s National Emergency Organization, as giving the figure.",
      "The blast happened at the Rajaei port just outside of Bandar Abbas, a major facility for container shipments for the Islamic Republic that handles some 80 million tons (72.5 million metric tons) of goods a year.",
      "Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers (miles) away from the epicenter of the explosion.",
      "Authorities have offered no cause for the explosion yet. Industrial accidents happen in Iran, particularly at its aging oil facilities that struggle for access to parts under international sanctions. But Iranian state TV specifically ruled out any energy infrastructure as causing or being damaged in the blast.",
      "Mehrdad Hasanzadeh, a provincial disaster management official, told Iranian state TV that first responders were trying to reach the area while others were attempting to evacuate the site.",
      "Hasanzadeh said the blast came from containers at Rajaei port in the city, without elaborating. State TV also reported there had been a building collapse caused by the explosion, though there were no immediate other details offered.",

      "ISTANBUL -- Police in Istanbul detained 47 people Saturday in dawn raids linked to a corruption investigation that saw the city\u2019s mayor imprisoned last month, leading to Turkey\u2019s largest protests in more than a decade.",
      "Among those arrested in Istanbul, the neighboring province of Tekirdag and the capital, Ankara, were senior officials from Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, local media reported.",
      "The March 19 detention of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who is the main challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule, saw hundreds of thousands of people flood the streets of Turkish cities to protest what many consider a politically motivated case. The government insists Turkey\u2019s judicial system is independent.",
      "In a statement, the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office said simultaneous operations were conducted against 53 suspects, six of whom remain at large. Searches were continuing at homes and workplaces, it added.",
      "Demonstrations against Imamoglu\u2019s jailing and wider democratic backsliding saw more than 2,000 people arrested for taking part in banned protests last month. Many of them were students but journalists and trades unionists were also among the detainees.",
      "Imamoglu, who also faces terror-related charges in a parallel investigation launched last month, was nominated the presidential candidate for his Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, while in prison. Elections are due in 2028 but could come earlier.",
      "The cases against him, which include several others that pre-date the March investigations, could see him banned from politics.",
      "The CHP-supporting Cumhuriyet newspaper reported that Saturday\u2019s arrests included the deputy secretary general of Istanbul municipality, Imamoglu\u2019s private secretary and the head of the city\u2019s water company. Gokhan Gunaydin, a senior CHP lawmaker, said the municipality was being \u201ceffectively rendered inoperable\u201d by the arrests.",
      "The wife of Imamoglu\u2019s adviser was also detained Saturday. The adviser was among some 100 arrested in March\u2019s wave of arrests and remains in prison.",
      "Demonstrations against what the opposition calls the \u201cMarch 19 coup\u201d are continuing, although on a smaller scale. Ankara governor\u2019s office said Saturday that 30 people were arrested at a protest the previous evening. The CHP was due to hold a rally later Saturday in the Mediterranean city of Mersin.",
      "The party won a swath of major cities in 2019 local elections, making further gains in last year\u2019s polls. In Istanbul, Imamoglu\u2019s victory ended 25 years of control for Erdogan\u2019s party and its predecessors.",

      "Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at the age of 88 after a 12-year papacy",
      "NEW YORK -- Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at the age of 88. His death set off mourning across the Catholic world and days of ritual at the Vatican. Here are the key things to know about the funeral of the first Latin American pontiff in the church's history:",
      "His funeral is being held on Saturday in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Francis will then be buried, according to his will: in a simple underground tomb at St. Mary Major Basilica. The church is home to his favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, to whom he was particularly devoted.",
      "The night before the funeral, the camerlengo presided over the closing and sealing of the coffin, in the presence of other senior cardinals. A white cloth was placed over Francis' face.",
      "A bag containing coins minted during his papacy was placed in the coffin along with a one-page written account of his papacy \u2014 known in Italian as a \u201crogito,\u201d a word indicating an official deed. It was read aloud by the master of liturgical ceremonies and then rolled up and slipped inside a cylindrical tube that was placed inside the coffin. Another copy is kept in the Vatican archives. The covers of both the zinc coffin and the wooden one bear a cross and Francis' papal coat of arms.",
      "Francis had said he wanted to be buried not in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica or its grottoes, where most popes are buried, but in the St. Mary Major Basilica across town. His choice reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus Populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).",
      "Before and after every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.",
      "Heads of state, including U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, are among those expected for the funeral. Others dignitaries include: Prince William, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa.",
      "Pope Francis had a 12-year papacy during which he charmed the world with his humility and concern for the poor. But the Argentina-born pope also alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change.",
      "The death of a pope starts a centuries-old ritual to elect a new one, involving sacred oaths by the cardinals, the piercing of ballots with a needle and thread after they\u2019re counted, and then burning them to produce either the white or black smoke to signal if there\u2019s a new leader for the world\u2019s 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "With the burial, the Catholic Church begins nine days of official mourning, known as the \u201cnovemdiales\u201d. The date of the conclave to elect a new pope has not yet been announced.",
      "In the conclave, the cardinals will vote in secret sessions, and the ballots will be burned in a special stove after each session. Black smoke indicates no pope has been elected; white smoke says the cardinals have chosen the next head of the Catholic Church.",
      "Any baptized Catholic male is eligible, though only cardinals have been selected since 1378. The winner must receive at least two-thirds of the vote from those cardinals under age 80 who are eligible to participate.",
      "Francis appointed the vast majority of electors, often tapping men who share his pastoral priorities, which suggests continuity rather than rupture.",
      "While it\u2019s impossible to predict who the next pope will be, some cardinals are considered to have better chances than others.",
      "Yes and no. \u201cConclave\u201d the 2024 film, introduced many laypeople to the ancient selection process with its arcane rules and grand ceremony, albeit with a silver screen twist packed full of palace intrigue and surprise.",
      "Vatican experts say the movie excels at re-creating the look and feel of a conclave. But there are discrepancies, errors and some outlandish storylines in the Hollywood version. And while the voting process was depicted accurately, the ballots are burned not after each vote, but after each session.",
      "Francis was known for his personal simplicity, from the choice of his name Francis in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, who renounced wealth to help the poor, to the outward symbols and priorities of his papacy.",
      "He chose to live in the Vatican's Domus Santa Marta hotel instead of the Apostolic Palace and wore his old orthotic shoes and not the red loafers of the papacy.",
      "In his teachings, he focused on concern for refugees and other marginalized people. His first trip outside Rome as pope in 2013 was to the Sicilian island of Lampedusa to meet with newly arrived migrants. His plea for welcome put him at odds with U.S. and European policies.",
      "He also also signaled a more welcoming stance toward LGBTQ+ people, while also making the fight against climate change a priority. Francis became the first pope to use scientific data in a major teaching document and made care for God\u2019s creation a hallmark of his papacy.",
      "He eschewed the grandiose even in his departure, lying in state in a simple coffin made of wood.",

      "The Vatican says for Saturday\u2019s burial procession, his casket will be placed on the back of a popemobile used during his 2015 trip to the Philippines.",
      "The vehicle has been modified so the casket will be visible to mourners along the nearly 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) route from St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to his place of burial.",
      "The pope reveled in being driven through crowds of faithful whether in St. Peter\u2019s Square or on one of his many foreign trips. His last was on Easter Sunday, when he looped around St. Peter\u2019s Square to the delight of the faithful who had followed his 5-week hospitalization for pneumonia and his recovery at the Vatican.",
      "The 13 spent the night in a nearby square. They were already coming to Rome for the planned canonization of the first millennial saint on Sunday, which was suspended by Francis\u2019 death. Instead, they drove up a day early for his funeral.",
      "\u201cThe Lord wanted it this way, so we came all the same,\u2019\u2019 said Sandra De Felice of Anoia in the Calabria region. \u201cFor me, this is a sign that we need to be truly humble and charitable. Otherwise, we are nothing.\u201d",
      "Ordinary mourners streamed Saturday to get a spot in standing room near the rear of the square surrounding the ancient obelisk, behind VIP seating. The area to the left of the main altar, up the basilica steps, is reserved for celebrants and Catholic hierarchy, while world leaders and royalty will be seated on the right.",
      "Many ran toward the square as barricades opened. Some carried banners for the Jubilee Holy Year that Francis opened in December and will continue despite his death Monday following a stroke.",

      "Canadians will vote for a new government in an election that has been upended by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and threats to make Canada the 51st state",
      "TORONTO -- Canadians will vote for a new government on Monday in an election that has been upended by U.S. President Donald Trump 's trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney and the governing Liberal Party appeared poised for a historic election defeat until Trump slapped heavy tariffs on Canada and began threatening its sovereignty.",
      "Trump's attacks have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips to their southern neighbor and avoiding buying American goods when they can. The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberals' poll numbers.",
      "The opposition Conservative Party had hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity cratered as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.",
      "Voters nationwide will elect all 343 member of the House of Commons, one for each constituency. There are no primaries or runoffs \u2014 just a single round of voting.",
      "Like the U.K., Canada uses a \u201cfirst-past-the-post\u201d voting system, meaning the candidate who finishes first in each constituency will be elected, even if they don\u2019t get 50% of the vote.",
      "This has generally cemented the dominance of the two largest parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, because it\u2019s difficult for smaller parties to win seats unless they have concentrated support in particular areas.",
      "The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.",
      "Carney replaced Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader, Carney, on March 9.",
      "Carney was sworn in as Canada\u2019s 24th prime minister on March 14. He hopes to retain the job and avoid becoming one of Canada\u2019s shortest-serving prime ministers.",
      "Carney, 60, is one of the two main candidates. He successfully navigated financial crises when he headed the Bank of Canada and later ran the Bank of England, becoming the first non-U.K. citizen to do so since its 1694 founding.",
      "A highly educated economist, Carney worked for 13 years for Goldman Sachs in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He has financial industry and public service credentials.",
      "Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney\u2019s main challenger. He and the party seemed headed for a big victory in the election until Trump's near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.",
      "Poilievre, 45, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put \u201cCanada first.\u201d For years his party\u2019s go-to attack dog, he frequently criticizes the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada\u2019s public broadcaster.",
      "There are two other parties that have official status in Parliament. If the Liberals or Conservatives secure the most seats in the House of Commons but fail to win a majority, they would need to rely on either the New Democrats, a progressive party, or the separatist Quebec party Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois to pass legislation.",

      "SRINAGAR, India -- Pakistani soldiers fired at Indian posts along the highly militarized frontier in disputed Kashmir for a second consecutive night, the Indian military said Saturday, as tensions continued to rise between the nuclear-armed rivals following a deadly attack on tourists last week.",
      "India has described the massacre, in which gunmen killed 26 people, most of them Indian tourists, as a \u201cterror attack\u201d and accused Pakistan of backing it.",
      "Pakistan denies the charge. The assault, near the resort town of Pahalgam in India-controlled Kashmir, was claimed by a previously unknown militant group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance.",
      "It was the restive region\u2019s worst assault targeting civilians in years. In the days since, tensions have risen dangerously between India and Pakistan, which have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir. The region is split between them and claimed by both in its entirety.",
      "The Indian army said Saturday that soldiers from multiple Pakistani army posts overnight opened fire at Indian troops \u201call across the Line of Control\u201d in Kashmir. \u201cIndian troops responded appropriately with small arms,\u201d the statement said, calling the firing \u201cunprovoked.\u201d",
      "There were no casualties reported, the statement added.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Pakistan, and the incidents could not be independently verified. In the past, each side has accused the other of starting border skirmishes in the Himalayan region.",
      "Markets and bazaars were open in Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Saturday, and there was no sign of evacuations from villages located near the Line of Control.",
      "India has suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty and closed the only functional land border crossing. It has also revoked visas issued to Pakistani nationals with effect from Sunday.",
      "Pakistan retaliated by canceling visas issued to Indian nationals, closing its airspace to all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines, and suspending all trade with India. Nationals from both sides began heading to their home countries through the Wagah border near Pakistan\u2019s eastern city of Lahore on Friday.",
      "Islamabad warned that any Indian attempt to stop or divert the flow of water would be considered an \u201cact of war.\u201d The suspension of the water treaty could lead to water shortages at a time when parts of Pakistan are already struggling with drought and declining rainfall.",
      "\u201cPakistan is fully prepared to confront any Indian aggression,\u201d the country\u2019s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said in a televised statement Friday.",
      "New Delhi describes all militancy in Kashmir as Pakistan-backed terrorism. Pakistan rejects this, and many Muslim Kashmiris consider the militants to be part of a home-grown freedom struggle.",
      "With tensions high between the two countries, Iran offered mediation, while U.S. President Donald Trump said he expected them to work out their differences.",
      "\u201cTehran stands ready to use its good offices in Islamabad and New Delhi to forge greater understanding at this difficult time,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Syed Abbas Araghchi said on Friday.",
      "\u201cIndia and Pakistan are brotherly neighbors of Iran, enjoying relations rooted in centuries-old cultural and civilizational ties. Like other neighbors, we consider them our foremost priority,\u201d Araghchi wrote in a social media post.",
      "Trump on Friday said \u201cthere\u2019s great tension between Pakistan and India, but there always has been.\u201d",
      "Trump, who spoke on board Air Force One, did not answer when asked by reporters whether he would contact leaders of the two countries, but said \u201cthey\u2019ll get it figured out one way or the other.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has long called for calm between India and Pakistan, and mediated between the two rivals during a major border skirmish in 1999.",
      "U.S. intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard expressed solidarity with India.",
      "\u201cWe are with you and support you as you hunt down those responsible for this heinous attack,\u201d Gabbard said on the X platform.",

      "Pope Francis is being laid to rest in ceremony reflecting his priorities as pope and wishes as pastor",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis is being laid to rest Saturday in a ceremony reflecting his priorities as pope and wishes as pastor: Presidents and princes will attend his funeral in St. Peter\u2019s Square, but prisoners and migrants will usher him into the basilica where he will be buried.",
      "As many as 200,000 people are expected to attend the funeral, which Francis choreographed himself when he revised and simplified the Vatican\u2019s rites and rituals last year. His aim was to emphasize the pope\u2019s role as a mere priest and not \u201ca powerful man of this world,\u201d the Vatican said.",
      "It was a reflection of Francis\u2019 12-year project to radically reform the papacy, to emphasize its pastors as servants, and to construct \u201ca poor church for the poor.\u201d It was a mission he articulated just days after his 2013 election and explained the name he chose as pope, in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, \u201cwho had the heart of the poor of the world,\u201d according to the official decree of the pope's life that was placed in his coffin Friday night.",
      "Nevertheless, the powerful will be in attendance Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, the U.N. chief and European Union leaders are joining Prince William and the Spanish royal family in leading official delegations. Argentine President Javier Milei had the pride of place given Francis' Argentine nationality, even if the two didn't particularly get along and Francis alienated many Argentines by never returning home.",
      "Francis is breaking with recent tradition and will buried in the St. Mary Major Basilica, near Rome's main train station, where a simple underground tomb awaits him with just his name: Franciscus. As many as 300,000 people are expected to line the 4-kilometer (2.5 mile) motorcade route that will bring Francis\u2019 casket from the Vatican through the center of Rome to the basilica after the funeral.",
      "Francis, the first Latin American and first Jesuit pope, died Easter Monday at age 88 after suffering a stroke while recovering at home from pneumonia.",
      "With his funeral, preparations can now begin in earnest to host the centuries-old process of electing a new pope, a conclave that will likely begin in the first week of May. In the interim, the Vatican is being run by a handful of cardinals, key among them Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals who is presiding at the funeral and organizing the secret voting in the Sistine Chapel.",
      "Over three days this week, more than 250,000 people stood for hours in line to pay their final respects while Francis\u2019 body lay in state in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The Vatican kept the doors open through the night to accommodate them.",
      "\u201cHe was an excellent, humble person who changed many laws and always for the better,\u201d said a pilgrim from his native Argentina, Augustin Angelicola, as he waited on line. \u201cNow it is a sad thing for the whole world that all this has happened. We did not expect it, it had to happen but not so soon.\u201d",
      "But even with the expanded hours, it wasn't enough. When the Vatican closed the doors to the general public at 7 p.m. on Friday, mourners were turned away in droves.",
      "Even before he became pope, Francis had a particular affection for St. Mary Major. It is home to a Byzantine-style icon of the Madonna, the Salus Popoli Romani, to which Francis was particularly devoted, such that he would go pray before it before and after each of his foreign trips as pope.",
      "He decided to have his tomb located in a niche next to the chapel housing the icon, with a reproduction of his simple silver pectoral cross over the marble tombstone.",
      "The choice of the basilica is also symbolically significant given its ties to Francis\u2019 Jesuit religious order. St. Ignatius Loyola, who founded the Jesuits, celebrated his first Mass in the basilica on Christmas Day in 1538.",
      "The Vatican said 40 special guests would greet his casket on the piazza in front of the basilica, reflecting the marginalized groups Francis prioritized pope: homeless people and migrants, prisoners and transgender people.",
      "\u201cThe poor have a privileged place in the heart of God,\u201d the Vatican quoted Francis as saying in explaining the choice. The actual burial will be private, presided over by cardinals and a few close aides.",
      "Italy is deploying more than 2,500 police and 1,500 soldiers to provide security, which also includes stationing a torpedo ship off the coast, and putting squads of fighter jets on standby, Italian media reported.",

      "President Donald Trump will be among more than 50 heads of state and other dignitaries attending the funeral for Pope Francis in Vatican City on Saturday",
      "ROME -- President Donald Trump will be among more than 50 heads of state and other dignitaries attending Saturday's funeral for Pope Francis, where he'll personally pay his respects to the Roman Catholic leader who pointedly disagreed with him on a variety of issues.",
      "Trump told reporters he was going to the funeral \u201cout of respect\u201d for the pontiff, who died Monday after suffering a stroke at the age of 88.",
      "The president and first lady Melania Trump arrived in Rome late Friday for the service at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Vatican City on Saturday morning. Francis will be laid to rest during a private burial at St. Mary Major Basilica outside the Vatican\u2019s walls.",
      "Francis sharply disagreed with Trump's approach on issues including immigration, the treatment of migrants and climate change. The Argentine pontiff and the American president sparred early in their relationship over immigration. In 2016, Francis, alluding to then-candidate Trump and his campaign slogan of \"Build the wall,\" called anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants \u201c not Christian.\u201d Trump said the comment was \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d",
      "But after Francis' death, the Republican president praised him as a \u201cgood man\u201d who \u201cworked hard\u201d and \u201cloved the world.\u201d Trump also directed that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff in Francis' honor.",
      "Trump had said on a couple of occasions before leaving Washington that he would have \u201ca lot\u201d of meetings with counterparts on the sidelines of the funeral. But he seemed to back away from that as he flew to Rome.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it's a little disrespectful to have meetings when you're at the funeral of a pope,\u201d the president told reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One. Nonetheless, Trump said: \u201cI'll be talking to people. I'll be seeing a lot of people.\u201d",
      "The leaders of France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary and Argentina are among those expected to attend.",
      "One person Trump didn't expect to interact with is former President Joe Biden, who planned to attend the funeral with his wife, Jill. Trump said he wasn't aware his Democratic predecessor would be at the funeral. Asked if they'd meet, Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s not high on my list. It\u2019s really not.\u201d",
      "The pope's funeral will not be one of those occasions that bring together the current and former U.S. presidents. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush are not attending, their offices said. A spokesperson for former President Bill Clinton did not respond to an inquiry about his plans.",
      "Trump didn't elaborate when asked if he\u2019d just be meeting leaders in passing or holding more in-depth talks. He suggested he might have meetings at Villa Taverna, the U.S. ambassador's residence, where he spent the night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little tough because we don\u2019t have much time,\" Trump said, noting his late arrival in Rome. He was scheduled to head back to the United States immediately after the funeral.",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re going to try and see a couple of people that are important in what we\u2019re doing,\" said Trump, who is trying to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and negotiate trade agreements with multiple countries.",
      "He posted on Truth Social shortly after arriving in Rome that Ukraine and Russia should meet for \u201cvery high level talks\u201d on ending the bloody three-year war sparked by Russia's invasion. His envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier Friday, and Trump said both sides were \u201cvery close to a deal.\u201d",
      "It was unclear if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would make it to Rome for the funeral. Putin is not attending.",

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has unveiled a new naval destroyer, claiming it as a significant advancement towards his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has unveiled a new naval destroyer, claiming it as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military, state media said Saturday.",
      "North Korea\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency said Kim attended the launching ceremony for the 5,000-ton warship on Friday at the western port of Nampo.",
      "Kim framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and its allies in Asia, who have been expanding joint military exercises amid rising tensions over the North\u2019s nuclear program. He added that the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening his navy.",
      "The new \u201cmultipurpose\u201d destroyer, touted by state media as the first in a new class of heavily armed warships, is designed to handle various weapons systems, including anti-air and anti-naval weapons, as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles, Kim said. He said the destroyer will be handed over to the navy early next year and begin active duty.",
      "Kim criticized recent efforts by the United States and South Korea to expand joint military exercises and update their nuclear deterrence strategies, portraying them as preparations for war. He vowed to \u201crespond decisively to this geopolitical crisis and ongoing developments,\u201d according to his speech carried by KCNA.",
      "South Korea\u2019s military didn\u2019t immediately comment on the North Korean claims about its new warship. North Korea\u2019s unveiling of the new warship follows its March revealing of a purported nuclear-powered submarine under construction. However, some experts question whether the impoverished and largely isolated nation could develop such advanced capabilities without foreign assistance.",
      "Nuclear-powered submarines were among a broad list of advanced weapons that Kim pledged to develop at a major political conference in 2021, citing growing U.S.-led threats. His wish list also included solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons, spy satellites, and multi-warhead missiles. Since then, North Korea has conducted a series of tests aimed at acquiring these capabilities.",
      "Regional tensions have increased as Kim continues to flaunt his military nuclear capabilities and align with Russia over President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would reach out to Kim again to revive diplomacy, but the North has not responded to that offer. While the two leaders met three times during Trump\u2019s first term, negotiations broke down over disagreements on easing U.S.-led sanctions in exchange for steps toward the North's denuclearization.",
      "Kim\u2019s foreign policy focus has since shifted to Russia, which he has supplied with weapons and military personnel to support its warfighting in Ukraine. South Korean officials are concerned that, in return, Pyongyang could receive economic aid and advanced military technology to further develop its weapons programs.",

She will be missed beyond measure.\u201d",
      "Her publicist Dini von Mueffling described Giuffre as \u201cdeeply loving, wise and funny.\"",
      "\u201cShe adored her children and many animals. She was always more concerned with me than with herself,\" von Mueffling wrote in a statement. \"I will miss her beyond words. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her.\u201d",

      "The American-born Giuffre, who lived in Australia for years, became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein's prolonged downfall.",
      "The wealthy, well-connected New York money manager killed himself in August 2019 while awaiting trial on U.S. federal sex trafficking charges involving dozens of teenage girls and young women, some as young as 14. The charges came 14 years after police in Palm Beach, Florida, first began investigating allegations that he sexually abused underage girls who were hired to give him massages.",
      "Giuffre came forward publicly after the initial investigation ended in an 18-month Florida jail term for Epstein, who made a secret deal to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty instead to relatively minor state-level charges of soliciting prostitution. He was released in 2009.",
      "In subsequent lawsuits, Giuffre said she was a teenage spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 President Donald Trump's Palm Beach club \u2014 when she was approached in 2000 by Epstein's girlfriend and later employee, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Giuffre said Maxwell hired her as a masseuse for Epstein, but the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates. Giuffre she was flown around the world for assignations with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18.",
      "The men denied it and assailed Giuffre's credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account, including the age at which she first met Epstein.",
      "But many parts of her story were supported by documents, witness testimony and photos \u2014 including one of her and Andrew, with his his arm around her bare midriff, in Maxwell\u2019s London townhouse.",

      "\u201cGhislaine said, \u2018I want you to do for him what you do for Epstein,\u2019\u201d Giuffre told NBC News\u2019 \u201cDateline\u201d in September 2019.",
      "Andrew categorically rejected Giuffre\u2019s allegations and said he didn't recall having met her.",
      "His denials blew up in his face during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties. He settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a \u201csubstantial donation\u201d to her survivors' organization. A statement filed in court said that the prince acknowledged Epstein was a sex trafficker and Giuffre \u201can established victim of abuse.\u201d",
      "She also filed, and in at least some cases settled, lawsuits against Epstein and others connected to him. In one case, she dropped her claims against a prominent U.S. attorney, saying she might have erred in identifying him as one of the men to whom Epstein supplied her.",
      "Epstein's suicide put an end to his accusers' hopes of holding him criminally accountable.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. She said said she wasn\u2019t to blame for Epstein\u2019s abuse.",
      "Prosecutors elected not to include Giuffre's allegations in the Maxwell case, but Giuffre later told the court that the British socialite had \"opened the door to hell.\u201d",

      "AGUASCALIENTES, M\u00e9xico -- There\u2019s a corner in central Mexico where much revolves around a revered saint. The neighborhood\u2019s name? Saint Mark's. The name of the local Catholic church? You guessed it, St. Mark's.",
      "It's no wonder then that the area's most renowned event is the Fair of Saint Mark \u2014 a monthlong celebration that starts every year in mid-April, attracting tourists for its bullfighting and musical events.",
      "Last year, 10 million visited the city of Aguascalientes, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) northwest of Mexico City, the country\u2019s capital. But the crowds on Friday were there for something more than just the fair. They came to honor Saint Mark, also known as Mark the Evangelist and celebrated in Christianity as one of Jesus\u2019 12 original disciples.",
      "Rev. Abel Carmona, who leads Masses and processions on April 25, when Catholics observe St. Mark's Day or the Feast of Saint Mark, says that \u201ceven if the fair\u2019s original purpose was commercial and agricultural, a religious sense was later added to it.\u201d",
      "He says the fair now promotes knowledge about St. Mark, whose relics are kept in Venice, Italy, where the landmark St. Mark\u2019s Basilica is located.",
      "The neighborhood was founded in 1620 as the settlement of \u201cIndios de San Marcos\u201d (St. Mark\u2019s Indians) by Spanish missionaries who built a small church.",
      "A fair was first held in November 1828 in a nearby village, mainly for farmers to offer their merchandise. But after a beautiful garden was constructed close to St. Mark's church 20 years later, authorities decided to host the fair in St. Mark\u2019s, ahead of the saint\u2019s feast day.",
      "Jodie Altamira, 35, grew up in the neighborhood and now helps organize processions and a bazar at the church during the fair, which she says it has been part of her identity, both as a resident of Aguascalientes and a Catholic.",

      "Carmona said this year was special because the community also marked what is known as \u201cthe defense of the temple.\u201d",
      "It commemorates a fraught time in the 1920s, when then-President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles planned to set up a Mexican \u201cschismatic\u201d church, independent from Rome. In February 1925, St. Mark\u2019s church was taken by priests loyal to Calles but the local residents staged a rebellion and eventually got their beloved temple back.",
      "\u201cIt was a heroic defense,\u201d Carmona said. \u201cAnd it was significant because it led to Calles giving up on his idea of founding a Mexican church.\u201d",
      "Carmona celebrated Mass throughout the day on Friday. Afterward, a concert was to follow and a procession before sunset.",
      "\u201cOur procession is a public manifestation to say that \u2018Saint Mark\u2019 is not just a pagan fair,\u201d Altamira said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we celebrate the saint who brought us to Jesus Christ.\u201d",

      "Francis, who died Monday at age 88, will be buried in a niche tomb in the basilica on Saturday after his funeral in St. Peter's Square about 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) away.",
      "Francis initially demurred when Archbishop Rolandas Makrickas suggested in May 2022 that he choose St. Mary Major as his last resting place. Makrickas had identified it because of Francis' long association with the basilica, its ties to Francis\u2019 Jesuit order, its artistic and spiritual heritage and links to the papacy. Seven other popes are buried there, but none since 1669.",
      "At first, \"he said no because popes are buried in St. Peter's,\" Makrickas told reporters on the steps of the basilica. \u201cAfter a week, he called me to (his home at the Vatican) Santa Marta and he said \u2018Prepare my tomb.\u2019\"",

      "Francis will be buried beneath a simple headstone made of marble from Liguria, the Italian region of his mother's family, engraved with his name in Latin: Franciscus. Above it will hang a slightly enlarged replica of his pectoral cross, featuring raised images of a shepherd carrying a sheep over his shoulders and a dove, but no other adornments.",
      "The tomb is placed in a niche next to the chapel where the Salus Populi Romani icon that the pope revered is located, and in a part of the basilica that was once a door to an adjacent palace where four popes lived. During his 12-year papacy, Francis would pray before the icon before and after each foreign trip.",
      "The basilica also has significance for the Jesuit pope: It's where the founder of the religious order, St. Ignatius Loyola, celebrated his first Mass on Christmas Day in 1538.",
      "The basilica is a pontifical basilica, one of four in Rome, and has never been \u201cdestroyed, damaged or burned\u201d over the ages, with history dating back to the fifth century. Makrickas called it \u201ca treasure chest of art and spirituality.\"",

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- The World Food Program says its food stocks in the Gaza Strip have run out under Israel\u2019s nearly 8-week-old blockade, ending a main source of sustenance for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the territory.",
      "The WFP said in a statement that it delivered the last of its stocks to charity kitchens that it supports around Gaza. It said those kitchens are expected to run out of food in the coming days.",
      "Some 80% of Gaza\u2019s population of more than 2 million relies primarily on charity kitchens for food, because other sources have shut down under Israel\u2019s blockade, according to the U.N. The WFP has been supporting 37 kitchens that produced some 500,000 meals a day.",
      "It was not immediately clear how many kitchens would still be operating in Gaza if those shut down.",
      "Israel cut off entry of all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza on March 2 and then resumed its bombardment and ground offensives two weeks later, shattering a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It says the moves aim to pressure Hamas to release hostages it still holds. Rights groups have called the blockade a \u201cstarvation tactic\u201d and a potential war crime.",
      "Israel has said Gaza has enough supplies after a surge of aid entered during the ceasefire and accuses Hamas of diverting aid for its purposes. Aid workers deny there is significant diversion of aid, saying the U.N. strictly monitors distribution. They say the aid flow during the ceasefire was barely enough to cover the immense needs from throughout the war when only a trickle of supplies got in.",
      "With no new goods entering Gaza, many foods have disappeared from markets, including meat, eggs, fruits, dairy products and many vegetables. Prices for what remains have risen dramatically, becoming unaffordable for much of the population. Most families rely heavily on canned goods.",
      "Malnutrition is already surging. The U.N. said it identified 3,700 children suffering from acute malnutrition in March, up 80% from the month before. At the same time, because of diminishing supplies, aid groups were only able to provide nutritional supplements to some 22,000 children in March, down 70% from February. The supplements are a crucial tool for averting malnutrition.",
      "Almost all bakeries shut down weeks ago and the WFP stopped distribution of food basics to families for lack of supplies. With stocks of most ingredients depleted, charity kitchens generally can only serve meals of pasta or rice with little added.",
      "World Central Kitchen -- a U.S. charity that is one of the biggest in Gaza that doesn\u2019t rely on the WFP -- said Thursday that its kitchens had run out of proteins. Instead, they make stews from canned vegetables. Because fuel is scarce, it dismantles wooden shipping pallets to burn in its stoves, it said. It also runs the only bakery still functioning in Gaza, producing 87,000 loaves of pita a day.",
      "The WFP said 116,000 tons of food is ready to be brought into Gaza if Israel opens the borders, enough to feed 1 million people for four months.",
      "Israel has leveled much of Gaza with its air and ground campaign, vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. It has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.",

      "The judge said the men were \u201cmotivated by a promise of financial gain\" in their agreement to murder Allen.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors alleged that the background to the shooting was the fact that Allen was a \u201csophisticated\u201d career criminal. He was convicted in 2009 for his part three years earlier in Britain\u2019s biggest armed robbery at a depot in Kent, southeast England, in which 54 million pounds ($72 million at current prices) in cash was stolen, much of which has never been recovered.",
      "Prosecutors said the men had burgled the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva on June 1, 2019, a month before Allen was shot.",
      "Three pieces of Ming-era porcelain were taken from the museum, which had a combined insurance value of around $3.6 million. Investigators also uncovered that the defendants flew to Hong Kong later that month, where they tried to sell one of the items they had stolen \u2014 a phoenix bowl \u2014 at an auction house.",
      "Jurors heard how elements of that crime echoed with the shooting of Allen, including the use of a Renault Captur hire vehicle.",
      "The case against the three men was given further impetus with the discovery in Nov. 2024 of an iPad in the River Thames that was used to track the movements of Allen before he was shot.",
      "\u201cThis attack may look like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster but the reality is something quite different,\u201d said Detective Superintendent Matt Webb of the Metropolitan Police, who led the investigation. \"This was horrific criminality.\"",

In return, he offered political support for the appointment of executives at BR Distribuidora when it was still state-owned.",
      "Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced to eight years and 10 months, to be served initially in prison, rather than under house arrest.",
      "Under the Brazilian legal system, cases concerning members of Congress, presidents and ministers go directly to the Supreme Court. He was not yet in prison because his lawyers were still lodging appeals.",
      "The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash, a sweeping corruption probe that has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America \u2014 including current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years.",
      "Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil.",
      "Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president's arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president's lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals.",
      "The justice also said that the court had previously ruled in similar cases that, once appeals have no merit, the sentence can be served right away.",
      "Collor's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",

      "NEW DELHI -- India and Pakistan have intensified their hostilities over the hotly contested Kashmir region following a massacre of 26 mostly Indian tourists, which New Delhi linked to Pakistan.",
      "Pakistan denies it was behind Tuesday's attack by gunmen on a group of tourists in Kashmir. Both sides have since escalated the tensions by exchanging diplomatic and trade sanctions against each other and raising fears of a military conflict.",
      "Here are five reasons why a flare-up between India and Pakistan matters:",
      "Under intense domestic pressure, India has hinted at the possibility of a limited military strike on Pakistan in response to what it called the \u201cterror attack\u201d with \u201ccross-border links.\u201d Pakistan made it clear that it will respond militarily to an attack.",
      "This raises fears that an escalation by any one side can lead to a wider war. The last time the two nations came to blows was in 2019, when a suicide car bombing killed 40 Indian soldiers in Kashmir.",
      "In 2021, the sides renewed a ceasefire agreement along their border, which has largely held. That relative calm was broken on Thursday after a brief exchange of fire between their armies.",
      "Both India and Pakistan are armed with nuclear weapons. There are fears that any conventional war or skirmish between them could potentially turn into a nuclear exchange.",
      "India and Pakistan have fought two major wars, in 1965 and 1971, but in 1974, India conducted its first nuclear tests, raising the stakes in any military conflict. It triggered a nuclear race and Pakistan reached that same milestone in 1998.",
      "Since then, India and Pakistan have had one major border skirmish in 1999 that killed at least 1,000 combatants. The fighting only stopped after U.S. intervened.",
      "India and China are geopolitical rivals whose armies clashed along the disputed Himalayan border in 2020. Ties between the Asian giants have improved since but they still maintain large numbers of troops on their borders. Their borders are also contiguous to Pakistan's, making it the world\u2019s only three-way nuclear junction.",
      "Beijing also controls part of the Kashmir region that New Delhi says belong to India.",
      "On the other hand, China is also a main ally of Pakistan and has helped advance its missile programs, creating additional military concerns for New Delhi. Meanwhile, India maintains strong defence ties with the U.S., which has long sought to limit Beijing\u2019s rise in the India-Pacific region.",
      "Experts say any conflict between India and Pakistan is unlikely to stay strictly between them, as their strategic partners are likely to get involved.",
      "In response to the massacre, India suspended a crucial treaty that governs the flow of river waters into Pakistan. Pakistan said it would consider any attempt to stop the flow of water from India an \u201cact of war.\"",
      "Under the Indus Water treaty, India is obliged to let six rivers flow freely to Pakistan. If India follows through and restricts the flow, it can have a devastating impact on Pakistan's agriculture as it battles acute water shortages.",
      "It's also also a major environmental issue. Water insecurity is a big concern in both India and Pakistan due to rapidly growing populations and climate change.",
      "Rights groups \u2014 including the U.N. \u2014 have blamed New Delhi for rights violations including civilian killings and arbitrary arrests in Indian-controlled Kashmir as a result of an intense crackdown by Indian forces. It has hurt India's human rights record and raised concerns that global powers are not doing enough to pressure New Delhi and hold it accountable.",
      "Militants fighting against Indian rule have also killed scores of civilians, including Hindu pilgrims.",
      "India has used military response against militants as part of its efforts to eradicate \u201cterrorism,\" saying it threatens regional stability.",

      "A Register reporter submitted a records request in February to Gov. Kim Reynolds' office, according to the complaint.

The attorney, Susan P. Elgin, called the withholding \u201clegally indefensible\u201d and asked the records be produced in a week's time.",

      "Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF published Friday, said she was \u201csatisfied\u201d with talks in Washington this week that included an International Monetary Fund conference and her one-on-one meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Keller-Sutter also serves as Switzerland\u2019s finance minister.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defined a group of 15 countries with which it wants to find ... a quick solution in this tariff question. Switzerland is part of this group of these 15 countries,\u201d she told reporters separately late Thursday in Washington.",

      "Before the Trump administration paused some of its most stringent tariff plans, products imported from Switzerland had been set to face tariffs of 31% \u2014 more than the 20% tariffs on goods from the European Union. Switzerland is not a member of the 27-country bloc.",
      "According to figures published by the Swiss Embassy in Washington, the U.S. has been Switzerland\u2019s most important goods export market worldwide since 2021, while Switzerland is the fourth most important export market for U.S. services. The bilateral trade volume in goods and services between Switzerland and the U.S. reached a total of $185.9 billion in 2023, the embassy says on its website.",
      "Keller-Sutter said a memorandum of understanding was to be drawn up after which negotiations can begin. A document would also lay out the most important topics, and \u201cwe have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration,\u201d she was quoted as saying.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. authorities have clearly expressed their desire to find a solution with Switzerland,\u201d Keller-Sutter told SRF. She said no timetable had been set, but the two sides agreed to move forward quickly \u201cbecause uncertainty is poison for the economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2 set off turmoil in world stock markets. A week later, Trump spoke by phone with Keller-Sutter in a conversation that her office said focused on tariffs. She emphasized the \u201cimportant role of Swiss companies and investments\" in the U.S.",
      "Hours later, Trump announced the U-turn that paused the steep new tariffs on about 60 countries for 90 days, fanning speculation \u2014 which was not confirmed \u2014 in some Swiss media that her chat with Trump might have played a role in the change of course.",
      "On Thursday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, during a trip to Beijing, said the U.S. tariffs have thrust the affected countries into \u201ca sort of coalition\u201d to try to reach a deal with the United States. And on Monday, Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche announced plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years \u2014 an unspecified amount of which has already been under way.",

      "Prosecutors allege that Moon, who served as president from 2017-2022, received bribes totaling 217 million won ($151,000) from Lee Sang-jik, founder of the budget carrier Thai Eastar Jet. The bribes were allegedly in the form of financial support for Moon\u2019s son-in-law between 2018-2020.",

      "Prosecutors said they had not found evidence that Moon directly arranged political favors for Lee, but that Lee, who worked on Moon\u2019s campaign, likely expected his assistance to be repaid. Lee was later named the head of the state-funded Korea Small and Medium Enterprises and Startups Agency and was nominated by Moon\u2019s party to run for parliament while Moon was in office.",

      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada\u2019s economy and threats to make it the 51st state have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips to the U.S. in big numbers. They also seem to have also flipped the narrative heading into Canada's parliamentary elections on Monday, with Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party surging after trailing far behind in the polls just a few months ago.",
      "The U.S. gets more visitors from Canada each year than from any other country, according to the U.S. Travel Association, an industry trade group, which said the 20.4 million visits from Canada last year generated $20.5 billion in spending.",
      "But there has been a big drop in foreigners traveling to the U.S. since Trump took office, and Canadians are no exception. There were more than 910,000 fewer land border crossings from Canada into the U.S. last month than in March of 2024 \u2014 a more than 22% drop \u2014 according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. An Air Canada spokesman, meanwhile, said Canada-U.S. flight bookings for April through September are down about 10%.",
      "Trump brushed aside the decline in tourism to the United States on Wednesday, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a little nationalism there I guess, perhaps. It\u2019s not a big deal.\"",
      "Since Trump started his second term, there have been well-publicized reports of tourists being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",
      "On March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actor and entrepreneur on a U.S. work visa, was detained by U.S. border agents in San Diego. She was released after 12 days detention.",
      "Before Mooney\u2019s release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying: \u201cIt certainly reinforces anxiety that ... many Canadians have about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.\u201d",
      "The Canadian Association of University Teachers, which represents faculty and staff at Canadian universities, warned its members against nonessential travel to the U.S. due to the \u201cpolitical landscape\u201d under Trump and reports of Canadians encountering difficulties crossing the border.",
      "Academics who have expressed negative views about the Trump administration should be particularly cautious about traveling to the U.S., said the group.",
      "\u201cPeople are scared to cross the border. I don\u2019t know what Americans are thinking, quite frankly. Are they that oblivious?\u201d said former Quebec Premier Jean Charest, who has family in Florida.",
      "Mike Sauer, who runs a community policing center in Vancouver, said he and his partner have no interest in traveling to the U.S. now because of Trump\u2019s politics and border fears. One of Sauer\u2019s concerns is that if a border guard were to check his cellphone, the guard might see his past purchases of marijuana, which is legal to buy in Canada and about half the 50 states but is still illegal under U.S. federal law.",
      "\u201cThe States have a different view on drugs. They could certainly look at my phone and see I\u2019m 420-friendly,\u201d he said, meaning he\u2019s marijuana-friendly. \u201cI think it kind of depends on which border guard would have a problem with that and which ones wouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Dietra Wilson, 32, said when she was younger, she often visited Detroit, which is just across the border from Windsor, Ontario, where she and her husband, Ben, own a secondhand shop. She hasn\u2019t visited much in recent years, though, and she said she's heard of people's worries about crossing the border since Trump moved back into the White House.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s worrisome,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben Wilson, 37, also has qualms about trying to cross.",
      "\u201cWhy would I want to?\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless of the tariffs, if I\u2019m going to be stopped at the border for my phone or something somebody texted me, why go?\u201d",
      "The drop in Canadian tourism to the U.S. led California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent target of Trump, to announce an ad campaign this month meant to lure Canadians back to his state, citing a 12% year-on-year drop in February.",
      "McKenzie McMillan, a consultant with a Vancouver-based travel agency, The Travel Group, said the company's bookings to the U.S. have dried up. \u201cWe have seen a near-total collapse of U.S. business,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably about a 90% drop since February.\u201d",
      "Lesley Keyter, the CEO and founder of the Travel Lady agency in Calgary, said she\u2019s seen people actually forfeit money to cancel their U.S. trips.",
      "\u201cEven if they\u2019re going on a Caribbean cruise, they don\u2019t want to go down to Fort Lauderdale to get on the cruise ship,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cIn the past, supply chains usually would run like Swiss clockwork, but now it's the opposite,\u201d said Ernesto Barcelo, chief ESG officer for metal components maker Gestamp, said of the uncertainty now dominating the market.",
      "\"The lack of stability now, it's something very ... fluffy,\" Barcelo said.",
      "A fundamental criteria for investing in any market is political stability, Wei Jianjun, chairman of Great Wall Motor Co., told reporters when asked about his company's plans to expand manufacturing overseas. That applies to countries like Hungary, where the company has not yet decided on whether to build a factory, he said, but also to the United States under Trump.",

Now the company based in central China's Wuhan acts as a consultant and allows foreign customers to adapt software to local requirements, said Ye Xiongfei, general manager for the company's autonomous driving division.",

      "\u201cTrump is a businessman and he hopes to boost the U.S. economy by imposing tariffs on other countries, but I do believe those measures are temporary,\u201d said Yang Jingdi, assistant to the CEO of LvXiang Automobile Parts Co., which makes electronics including rearview mirrors and pumps.",

      "BERLIN -- The German government forecast Thursday that the country's economy, Europe's biggest, will stagnate this year as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade threats weigh on its performance following months of political uncertainty.",
      "Outgoing Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the government cut its 2025 outlook to zero from the modest growth of 0.3% it predicted at the end of January. For next year, it is forecasting growth of 1%, slightly lower than the 1.1% it predicted three months ago.",
      "\u201cThere is above all one reason for this, namely Donald Trump's trade policy and the effects of the trade policy on Germany,\u201d Habeck told reporters in Berlin. He noted that Germany also hasn't had a government with a parliamentary majority to set policy since early November, and the new government isn't yet in place after an election in February.",
      "Germany hasn\u2019t seen significant economic growth in five years. The country for years expanded exports and dominated world trade in engineered products like industrial machinery and luxury cars.",
      "But it\u2019s suffered from increasing competition from Chinese companies, along with many other factors, and the economy contracted in each of the last two years.",
      "Trump's tariffs have added a further risk to German exports. Last year, the United States was Germany\u2019s biggest single trading partner for the first time since 2015, displacing China from the top spot as exports to the Asian power declined.",
      "The German parliament plans to meet on May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the country\u2019s next leader, if all the parties in his proposed government approve a coalition agreement reached earlier this month.",
      "Last month already, the prospective partners pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that\u2019s aimed at boosting the economy.",

      "A new AP-NORC poll suggests Americans\u2019 trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering",
      "WASHINGTON -- Americans\u2019 trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president\u2019s broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.",
      "Roughly half of U.S. adults say that Trump\u2019s trade policies will increase prices \u201ca lot\u201d and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up \u201csomewhat,\u201d according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.",
      "While skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesn\u2019t mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation.",
      "Three months into his second term, Trump\u2019s handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. That\u2019s roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.",
      "Matthew Wood, 41, said he\u2019s waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but he\u2019s feeling anxious.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends,\u201d said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. \u201cPersonally, it hasn\u2019t affected me as of yet. But, generally, I don\u2019t know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.\u201d",
      "Still, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump\u2019s attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he\u2019s willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs.",
      "About half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That\u2019s up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn\u2019t previously have an opinion on tariffs.",
      "Trump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries.",
      "\u201cActually, I think he shouldn\u2019t have suspended it,\u201d said Manis, a retired sheriff\u2019s deputy from Del Rio, Texas. \u201cBecause now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen.\u201d",
      "Not quite 100 days into Trump\u2019s second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.",
      "Trump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He\u2019s imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes \u2014 albeit partially suspending some of them \u2014 launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump\u2019s tariff pronouncements.",
      "Many Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll.",
      "Stocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump\u2019s tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.",
      "Trump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not \u201csustainable.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want \u2014 a sign of the economy\u2019s resilience so far.",
      "Retirement savings are a source of anxiety \u2014 about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a \u201cmajor source\u201d of stress in their lives. But fewer \u2014 only about 2 in 10 \u2014 identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety.",
      "\u201cThis whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide,\u201d said Nicole Jones, 32. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge \u2014 and everybody\u2019s losing on it.\u201d",
      "The Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadn\u2019t given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt.",
      "\u201cThings are more expensive for us,\u201d she said.",
      "And most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state.",
      "The difference is that Republicans \u2014 who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president \u2014 now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the country\u2019s financial future.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine,\u201d Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trump\u2019s policies went into effect.",

      "Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said Wednesday that he doesn\u2019t expect the U.S. trade war with China to deter the company from its financial recovery and aircraft delivery targets even though Chinese airlines are refusing to accept the company\u2019s planes",
      "Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said Wednesday that he doesn\u2019t expect the U.S. trade war with China to forestall the company's financial recovery, nor prevent it from reaching aircraft delivery targets with Chinese airlines now refusing to accept Boeing planes.",
      "Speaking on CNBC, Ortberg said that Boeing had three airplanes in China ready for delivery, but that two of them had been returned to Seattle so far because Beijing has stopped taking deliveries due to the dispute with the U.S.",
      "While the company had planned to send about 50 airplanes to China this year, Ortberg said Boeing will be \u201cpretty pragmatic\u201d going forward.",
      "\u201cFor those airplanes that haven't been built yet, we'll be looking to maybe redirect those to other customers,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the airplanes that have been built, we call it remarketing. There's plenty of customers out there looking for the Max aircraft.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2 that triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.",
      "On Tuesday U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a speech that the ongoing tariffs showdown against China is unsustainable and he expects a \u201cde-escalation\u201d in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "Boeing reported its first-quarter financial results on Wednesday, posting an adjusted loss of 49 cents per share on revenue of $19.5 billion. The results topped the expectations of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research, which called for a loss of $1.54 per share on revenue of $19.29 billion.",
      "The company also significantly reduced its cash burn to approximately $2.29 billion from nearly $4 billion in the prior-year period.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The height of tax season was the height of turmoil at the IRS.",
      "The agency shuffled through three acting directors over the course of a week. It\u2019s preparing to lose tens of thousands of workers to layoffs and voluntary retirements. And President Donald Trump is weighing in on which nonprofits should lose their tax-exempt status, an incursion into the agency\u2019s typically apolitical stance that threatens to further erode trust in federal institutions and weaponize enforcement efforts.",
      "Just three months into Trump's second term, the government's fly-under-the-radar tax collector has become the latest platform for the Republican administration\u2019s vision to cut and control the federal bureaucracy. Tax policy experts fear that taxpayer services and collection efforts will face prolonged delays as a result of the rapid changes.",
      "The quick turnover in leadership and other changes are likely to dampen employee morale at the IRS and hurt the agency\u2019s ability to serve taxpayers in a timely manner, says Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cLeadership sets the tone, particularly in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Already, she notes, the agency has lost decades of institutional knowledge from nonpartisan career civil servants who have left over policy disagreements and layoffs.",
      "The upheaval unfolded as Americans dutifully filed their taxes ahead of the April 15 deadline and as a legion of IRS employees undertook work to process returns and dole out refunds. The latest filing season data shows the agency accepted more than 117 million returns this tax season and issued $228.7 billion in refunds.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to improving the efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service,\" said the agency's newest acting commissioner, Michael Faulkender. \"For the last 35 years, we\u2019ve been five years away from the IRS being modernized. Under the direct leadership of Treasury, the modernization will be done in two years at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS, like other federal agencies, is hemorrhaging employees over cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, all while the agency churns through acting leaders as it awaits the installation of a permanent leader.",
      "Douglas O'Donnell, the Trump administration's first acting IRS commissioner, announced his retirement in February as furor spread over DOGE gaining access to IRS taxpayer data. Melanie Krause, the second acting commissioner, resigned early this month over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Gary Shapley, an IRS whistleblower who testified publicly about investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes, was acting commissioner for a matter of days before being replaced by Faulkender, who was elevated just last week. The New York Times reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had complained to Trump that Shapley had been installed without his knowledge and at the behest of Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Trump's nominee for IRS commissioner, former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, is still waiting for a confirmation hearing but faces controversies of his own. Most recently, Senate Democrats have called for a criminal investigation into Long's connections to alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits. Long did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.",
      "Among other concerns at the agency are fears that Trump will weaponize the IRS against his enemies \u2014 and reward his friends.",
      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political institutions, including fundraising platform ActBlue and the protest group Indivisible, are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",
      "Trump said last week at the White House that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status of Harvard University, which has defied the government's attempts to limit activism on campus, and environmental groups. He also mentioned the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said of CREW. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Jonathan S. Masur, an administrative law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said it's unlawful for the president to unilaterally take away organizations' tax-exempt status.",
      "\u201cIt's illegal for starters. The Supreme Court has established that that step is not allowed,\u201d he said, adding that he anticipates that the court system will \u201cvery quickly block\u201d any such move from the president.",
      "The Trump administration is also watching out for allies of the president.",
      "Treasury official David Eisner sent an email in March to a top IRS official regarding Mike Lindell, the founder of MyPillow and one of the chief proponents of the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018My Pillow guy\u2019 and a high-profile friend of the President recently received an audit letter, from what I understand, his second in two years,\u201d Eisner wrote in the email, which was viewed by the AP. The president \u201cis concerned that he may have been inappropriately targeted,\" Eisner wrote.",
      "Among other changes in recent weeks are concerns about the IRS' engagement with the Department of Homeland Security over enforcing a new data-sharing agreement signed earlier this month by Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The agreement will allow ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.",
      "That agreement is being litigated in federal court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich will soon decide whether to refuse or grant a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups. The groups argue that immigrants in the country illegally who pay taxes are entitled to the same privacy protections as U.S. citizens and immigrants who are legally in the country.",
      "The Treasury Department says the agreement will help carry out Trump\u2019s agenda to secure U.S. borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids and the use of an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "Holtzblatt said the agreement is indicative of the turmoil at the IRS.",
      "\u201cThere's an emphasis on improving technology and sharing information,\" but it's unclear for what reason, she said.",

      "This year's show in the sprawling industrial outskirts of Shanghai comes at a pivotal moment. Three decades after Beijing set out to build a world-class auto industry, local manufacturers account for about two-thirds of sales inside China, and a growing share of global exports.",
      "But with U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs and the European Union slapping duties on Chinese electric vehicles, selling to some overseas markets is growing increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cGeopolitics are very complex and the situation remains uncertain,\u201d Wei Jianjun, chairman of Great Wall Motors, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBut Great Wall is always exploring investments in overseas markets.\u201d",
      "The exhibition is holding two media days and two trade days before it opens to the public on Sunday. It runs until May 2.",
      "Encouraged by government subsidies for scrapping older cars for the latest models, Chinese drivers have embraced the switch to electrics, with sales of battery powered and hybrid vehicles jumping 40% last year.",
      "A total of 31.4 million vehicles including buses and trucks were sold last year in the world\u2019s biggest market by sales, up 4.5% compared to a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported.",
      "Growth in sales of EVs was offset by falling sales of traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, which still accounted for just over half of new car sales.",
      "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD nudged past Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of EVs by sales last year, reporting revenue of over $100 billion. It recently announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about the time needed to fill up at the pump. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "To gain access to China's potentially huge market, foreign automakers like Volkswagen, General Motors, BMW and Ford set up joint ventures with state-owned local companies beginning in the 1980s and '90s, helping them build the capacity and technology to compete on a world scale.",
      "They also created sprawling supply chains in Shanghai and other major manufacturing hubs, helping to nurture other big names in Chinese automaking, such as BYD, Geely and Great Wall Motors.",
      "With growth at home limited by brutal competition, they're expanding rapidly especially in Southeast Asia and other developing economies with relatively affordable sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks.",
      "Shanghai\u2019s auto show is a gathering for the \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d said Zhou Lijun, director and chief researcher of the industry analysis group Yiche Research Institute.",
      "That doesn't mean all the EV makers go it alone. BYD teamed up with Daimler, now the Mercedes-Benz Group, to launch its Denza premium brand. It's also challenging Toyota and other top tier brands with its luxury Yangwang brand, priced at up to 2 million yuan ($280,000)",
      "Opening markets wider to foreign competition has given car buyers a choice of more affordable, innovative vehicles. That's a mixed blessing for older automakers like GM, Ford, Toyota and VW that are also fighting a battle of attrition in China.",
      "\u201cChina is still a market worth fighting for,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the BMW Group, which like other automakers highlighted a \u201cIn China, for China,\u201d approach, at \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "Overhanging the upbeat talk in Shanghai by both Chinese and foreign automakers of manufacturing in China for the world are Trump's tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, despite a 90-day pause that has spared many other countries, and 25% U.S. tax on imported cars and auto parts.",
      "Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s head of China operations, Stephen Ma, said the company plans to make 10 new battery electric or hybrid models by 2027 in China, for China and for \u201cexport to the world, except one country \u2014 you can guess which one.\"",
      "Higher U.S. and European tariffs on foreign-made EVs are prompting Chinese newcomers to shift production closer to those markets as more Western consumers opt for the latest Chinese models.",
      "Just a few decades ago, Nissan, Toyota and other Japanese automakers were fighting trade friction with the United States over their own exports. Now, they employ hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers at their U.S. factories.",
      "\u201cThe trade war between China and the United States has blocked direct exports from China to the United States, but it hasn't blocked local production there or the establishment of global production bases in Europe or elsewhere,\" Zhou said.",
      "A report by the Rhodium Group shows that nearly half the world's markets are restricting imports from China, in part because of national security concerns linked to the advanced electronics in EVs and other high-tech vehicles. A minority of countries like Australia and South Africa remain relatively open, and Russia is a major market but is nearly saturated, it says.",
      "Chinese automakers lag behind global leaders like Toyota in conventional gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles, but they can sell EVs at roughly the same price, while also solving the problems of range and fast charging.",
      "China has become part of what geopolitical analyst Yanmei Xie described as a \u201ctechnological paradigm shift\u201d in a commentary in the Japanese financial publication Nikkei Asia. Automakers in China are going electric not just because of the green transition, but as a route to \u201ctechnological and industrial dominance,\u201d she wrote.",

      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports has revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport",
      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports, prompted by the deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday the potential for a collision between air tour helicopters and planes at Harry Reid International Airport led the agency to make immediate changes to flying rules. In the first three weeks after implementation the number of collision alerts for planes dropped 30%.",
      "The FAA said after the collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in January, which killed 67 people, that it planned to use artificial intelligence to dig into the millions of reports it collects to assess other places with busy helicopter traffic, including Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and along the Gulf Coast.",
      "The FAA\u2019s acting administrator, Chris Rocheleau, said Las Vegas quickly became a concern once the agency dug into the data because agreements with helicopter operators there didn\u2019t clearly define vertical and lateral separation requirements when helicopters were approaching the airport. And air traffic controllers in the tower weren\u2019t issuing traffic advisories between returning helicopters and airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe took quick action including exercising positive control over the helicopters and issuing more traffic advisories to pilots,\u201d Rocheleau said. He promised to take additional actions in Las Vegas and at other airports where the FAA identifies concerns.",
      "Luke Nimmo, a spokesperson for Clark County Department of Aviation, referred all questions about the findings to the FAA.",
      "Following the crash of a New York City sightseeing helicopter into the Hudson River that killed six people April 10, the FAA said it was establishing a rulemaking committee to develop recommendations for improving commercial air tour safety.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former National Transportation Safety Board and FAA accident investigator, said the fact that collision alerts for planes dropped so quickly \u201cindicates a real hazard existed before the FAA looked at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough to characterize how significant the hazard was,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s yet another hole in the Swiss cheese that can line up with other holes and cause an accident just like what happened in Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "He said it made sense that the FAA first addressed the Las Vegas airport, given its large mix of helicopters and commercial traffic.",
      "\u201cI think that they will find issues at other airports, but maybe not to the degree that they found with this one,\u201d Guzzetti added.",
      "Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said there have long been safety issues with the helicopter tour industry, describing it as slipping in many cases into \u201cbecoming an attraction rather than a safe ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately in aviation, it is accidents that bring the attention of the regulators to their responsibilities,\" he added.",
      "The January midair collision near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport was the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since 2001. A series of other crashes and near misses in the months since have raised worries about air travel, even though it remains safe overall.",
      "Helicopters have been a key concern, but Rocheleau said the core safety issues remain operations and maintenance problems. He said the top causes of helicopter accidents include loss of control and striking an object during low-altitude operations.",
      "The FAA said its review of the safety data has expanded beyond helicopters to look at airports with a mix of many different planes and airports that are close together.",
      "The proximity between Hollywood Burbank Airport and Van Nuys Airport in the Los Angeles area emerged as a concern because they are less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. Both airports serve a wide mix of aircraft and have arrival and departure paths that are close.",
      "A spokesperson for the Hollywood Burbank Airport referred questions to the FAA. The Van Nuys Airport didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "\u201cWhile flying remains the safest mode of transportation, we must always strive to do better,\u201d Rocheleau said. \u201cWe have to identify trends and get smarter about how we use data. And when we put corrective actions in place, we must execute them.\u201d",
      "Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents several families of victims of the D.C. plane crash, praised the FAA for taking action to make helicopter flights safer.",
      "\u201cAs a frequent critic of the FAA, I must say that the FAA deserves recognition for taking these steps to protect the traveling public,\" he said. \"Helicopters are known for being the most dangerous and potentially unsafe aircraft. The extra vigilance by the FAA may save many lives.\u201d",

      "The outlook for the U.S. and global economies this year and next has significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and the uncertainty they have created",
      "WASHINGTON -- The outlooks for the U.S. and global economies have significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.",
      "The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.",
      "U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesn't expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to 37%.",
      "The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. \u201cThis global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset.\u201d",
      "The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.",
      "Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties.",
      "Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didn\u2019t substantially change the IMF\u2019s forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Companies may pull back on investment and expansion as they wait to see how the trade policies play out, which can slow growth.",
      "China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of U.S. tariffs. The IMF now expects it will expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.",
      "While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a \u201csupply shock,\u201d similar to what hampered during the pandemic and which pushed up inflation in 2021 and 2022, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall.",
      "Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.",
      "The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.",
      "The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMF\u2019s January forecast.",
      "Japan\u2019s growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.",

      "The city of Bath in southwest England loves its rugby",
      "BATH, England -- Talk about a scrum.",
      "The rugby club in the English city of Bath is at odds with some of its neighbors over plans to expand the team\u2019s beloved stadium.",
      "Though Bath Rugby won a legal case that went all the way to Britain\u2019s Supreme Court, its plan to boost the Recreation Ground, or The Rec \u2014 its \u201cspiritual home\u201d since 1894 \u2014 faces more hurdles.",
      "That\u2019s because the city of Bath is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, renowned for its Roman roots, Georgian architecture and scenic landscapes. And the stadium sits in the heart of it, along the River Avon.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not anti-rugby. This isn\u2019t about a sport. This is looking at what\u2019s best for this city,\u201d Joanna Wright, a Green Party member of the Bath and North East Somerset Council, said as tourists stopped for photos near Pulteney Bridge.",
      "Wright, who opposes the plan, worries that reducing the \u201cgreen setting\u201d will impact the UNESCO designation. She motions toward the hills beyond the stadium\u2019s temporary East Stand, which in the rebuild would become permanent rather than be removed each summer.",
      "She noted that the city of Liverpool lost its world heritage status in 2021 because of waterfront developments, including Everton's new soccer stadium.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the World Heritage organization will do, but we do know that they have decided that Liverpool is no longer going to get its status, so do you want to risk that?\u201d Wright said.",
      "Bath Rugby \u2014 currently atop the Premiership standings \u2014 wants to expand from about 14,500 capacity to 18,000 and create \u201ca new sporting, cultural and leisure stadium.\u201d",
      "Bath\u2019s planning committee has targeted September for a decision. In a public comment period, a large majority of respondents favored the plan.",
      "\u201cThey recognize the importance of the sport to the city,\u201d Doug Wrigglesworth, chairman of the Bath Rugby Supporters Club, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic stadium. (But) It It really needs to be brought up to date.\"",
      "Bath Rugby has played home matches there for more than 125 years. Facilities were damaged in the 1942 \u201cBath Blitz\u201d bombing by Germany\u2019s Luftwaffe during World War II.",
      "After rugby union became professional in the mid-1990s, the club began adding capacity bit by bit.",
      "Much of the seating is unprotected from the weather, and efforts to squeeze in more fans had been dubbed \u201cOperation Sardine.\u201d",
      "Still, it's a bucket-list destination for rugby enthusiasts, the way baseball fans in the United States flock to Fenway Park or Wrigley Field. Pubs and restaurants fill up on matchdays.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite a big advert for the city,\u201d said Wrigglesworth, who has been attending matches for 45 years. \u201cIt brings the city alive.\"",
      "Wright, however, describes game days as \u201cpandemonium and getting in and out of the city is problematic.\u201d",
      "Bath was England's top team in the 1990s and won the European Rugby Champions Cup in 1998. Today, its star player is flyhalf Finn Russell, the Scotland captain.",
      "Rugby union has been struggling financially. In the 2022-23 season, no Premiership club made a profit, according to the Leonard Curtis Rugby Finance Report. The Rec\u2019s capacity utilization in '22-23 was 91% \u2014 second highest in the league.",
      "Expanding the stadium would generate more match-day revenue and corporate partnerships.",
      "Bath Rugby, owned by businessman Bruce Craig, declined interview requests.",
      "Bath in 1987 was declared a World Heritage Site, and in 2021 received a second moniker as one of the Great Spa Towns of Europe.",
      "UNESCO \u2014 the UN\u2019s cultural agency \u2014 had put Liverpool on an \u201cendangered\u201d list years before pulling its world heritage designation. Last year, it rejected recommendations to put Stonehenge on the list.",
      "Besides the UNESCO designation, concerns have been raised in Bath about everything from noise and transportation to the welfare of bats and beavers.",
      "The UK government\u2019s Environment Agency cautioned in a letter to the planning committee that the plan\u2019s environmental statement overlooks the European beaver \u2014 a protected species.",
      "\u201cBeavers need to be considered as they are now known to be present in good numbers on the Avon with numerous active territories in the Bath area and Pulteney Gate being directly on the main dispersal route for these animals,\u201d read the Environment Agency\u2019s recent letter, which also raised flooding concerns.",
      "The club's plan has prompted feedback about the need to protect bats, too, with stadium lighting flagged as a potential problem.",
      "Residents scored a legal victory a few years ago by citing a 1922 covenant that said nothing should be built on the ground that would disturb the neighborhood. Bath Rugby got that overturned, however, when the Court of Appeal ruled that covenant language was too vague.",
      "And when the Supreme Court in October 2022 declined to hear an application to appeal the ruling, the expansion plan was back on. The club has been revising it since then to incorporate feedback.",
      "The UK committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites \u2014 ICOMOS serves as adviser to UNESCO on cultural World Heritage Sites \u2014 recently submitted its concerns to the planning committee.",
      "ICOMOS-UK noted improvements in the design but encouraged \u201cfurther reductions in height, especially to the central roof section, and a design approach that overcomes the exaggerated mass and scale and the incompatible form within the otherwise harmonious city.\u201d It warned of \u201csignificant permanent harm.\"",
      "However, Historic England, a public body that seeks to champion England\u2019s history and environment, wrote that it has \u201cno objection to the application on heritage grounds.\u201d",
      "Wright, the city councilor, said one of her favorite aspects of living in Bath is \u201cwherever you are, you can always see trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of the (reasons) why it\u2019s been given World Heritage status, it\u2019s not just that it has all this heritage, it has settings of green spaces. Once you put in such a massive commercial development to the heart of the city, you change it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Paul Skenes and his parents got a suite at Dodger Stadium on Friday night and handed out tickets for about 35 aunts, uncles, cousins and friends",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Paul Skenes and his parents got a suite at Dodger Stadium on Friday night and handed out tickets for about 35 aunts, uncles, cousins and friends.",
      "\u201cI was playing for free tonight,\u201d he joked.",
      "Seemed like everybody Skenes knows from back home wanted to watch the Pittsburgh Pirates' 22-year-old ace from nearby Orange County when he took the mound against the Los Angeles Dodgers and their own top pitcher, Yoshinobu Yamamoto.",
      "Between Yamamoto's brilliance, the powerhouse lineup sent out by the defending World Series champions and the pressure of wanting to perform for his family and friends, this showdown might have been one of the most challenging nights of Skenes' incredible young career.",
      "He responded with poise and tenacity \u2014 and six pitches that seem to get better every month.",
      "Skenes outdueled Yamamoto, pitching five-hit ball into the seventh inning on a career-high 108 pitches.",
      "He retired Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts three times apiece, and he stranded Freddie Freeman after both of his hits.",
      "Skenes (3-2) got the victory in Pittsburgh\u2019s 3-0 win over Los Angeles, racking up nine strikeouts with no walks.",
      "A pitcher who has the entire sport's attention put together a night his family won't soon forget. Although he wasn't overly thrilled by the finer details of his performance, even Skenes couldn't deny he got the job done.",
      "\u201cEven when you execute pitches, they\u2019re still going to find ways to get on,\u201d Skenes said. \u201cI definitely executed better today than the other two times I faced them, but that\u2019s just kind of the nature of it. They\u2019re really good hitters. You just have to find ways to get through innings.\u201d",
      "Skenes did it repeatedly, and his escapes from the fourth and fifth innings were remarkable.",
      "Freeman ended up on third leading off the fourth when Bryan Reynolds had trouble tracking down the slugger's double to right. Skenes induced a short groundout from Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, struck out Tommy Edman and got Will Smith to fly out.",
      "\u201cI think you saw why Paul Skenes is who Paul Skenes is,\u201d Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said. \u201cBecause to go through where he went at in their order and come out with a zero is extremely impressive.\u201d",
      "Skenes then gave up a two-out double to Andy Pages in the fifth, bringing up Ohtani. He even fell behind 3-1 in the count, but Skenes got Ohtani to foul off a splitter before he whiffed the three-time MVP with a diabolically good curve.",
      "When asked where he found the confidence to throw those two breaking balls, Skenes shrugged.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal to go down 3-1 against probably the best hitter in the game, but what do I have to lose?\u201d he asked. \u201cLiterally, just what do I have to lose? Let\u2019s see what we\u2019re made of, and see how my stuff is. If he\u2019s supposed to get out, he\u2019ll get out. That at-bat, I was all over the place. A couple of terrible pitches. But you\u2019ve just got to hunker down and execute in those situations.\u201d",
      "Shelton even allowed Skenes to go out for the seventh, but just for one batter. He struck out Smith with a splitter that broke like a Frisbee and then left the mound to appreciative cheers from his family \u2014 and even many Dodgers fans.",
      "\u201cI think that he\u2019s one of the best in the game, and when he needed a strikeout, he did it in that one inning,\" Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said. \"He finds a way to limit damage. He kept us off balance with his off-speed stuff, the sweeper, the splinker, obviously the fastball is 97, 98. ... We really couldn\u2019t muster much.\u201d",
      "Yamamoto had been arguably the majors' best pitcher over the last month, entering the night with an 0.93 ERA after allowing no earned runs in three straight starts.",
      "But not much went smoothly for Yamamoto against the Pirates, who strung together two rallies \u2014 the second abetted by Max Muncy's throwing error, which eventually led to two unearned runs in the fifth.",
      "Pittsburgh's five hits off Yamamoto were all singles, but he also issued four walks \u2014 two in his 32-pitch first inning. While Yamamoto eventually settled in with an impressive mix of pitches, his teammates couldn't help him out.",
      "\u201cI think if you like pitching, you saw two guys with a lot of pitches today with the ability to execute them,\u201d Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said. \u201cIt was a fun game to watch if you like pitching.\u201d",
      "Skenes will get to savor this win a bit more than the others: He already got family time Friday several hours before he took the mound, and he planned to meet up with everybody afterward as well.",
      "\u201cToday was kind of a family get-together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all my mom\u2019s brothers and my dad\u2019s brother, and their families are all here, which is cool. Hasn\u2019t happened for a while, so it's cool to be able to share that with them.\u201d",

      "This trip to Minnesota for Doncic in the NBA playoffs is off to an awfully rough start.",
      "Doncic managed to play 40 minutes with a stomach illness in Minnesota's 116-104 victory over the Lakers on Friday night in Game 3 of the first-round series, finishing with just 17 points on 6-for-16 shooting with a team-high five turnovers.",
      "Doncic, who had eight assists and seven rebounds, was clearly not himself from the start. Lakers coach J.J. Redick said Doncic was vomiting all afternoon before the late game that tipped off at 8:54 p.m.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been feeling well for the last 24 hours. I don\u2019t know how much he slept last night. He didn\u2019t feel well last night,\u201d Redick said. \u201cHe was really under the weather.\u201d",
      "Doncic didn't start the second half, checking in during the first minute of the third quarter. A little after that, he had the ball poked out of his hands by Rudy Gobert in the backcourt, beginning a fast break the Timberwolves finished with a three-point play thanks to a foul on Doncic during one of several sloppy sequences for the five-time All-NBA pick whose shocking trade from the Mavericks to the Lakers was the biggest story in a season full of twists and turns throughout the league.",
      "\u201cHe gave everything he had tonight. He played 39, 40 minutes. He did everything he could do to help us win. We had opportunities,\u201d said Austin Reaves, who had 20 points for the Lakers. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get it done.\u201d",
      "Doncic was receiving postgame treatment and not made available to the media.",
      "The Target Center crowd that watched Doncic dismantle Minnesota\u2019s league-leading defense for Dallas in the conference finals last spring was delighted to see him struggle. He didn\u2019t have much opportunity to play the villain, struggling to create clean shots and hardly talking much trash.",
      "Jaden McDaniels, Minnesota's ace defender, made it tough on Doncic to both shoot and handle the ball. Anthony Edwards threw down a dunk over him in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cI was just picking him up every time. I couldn\u2019t tell that he was going through anything,\u201d said McDaniels, who scored 30 points for his career playoffs high.",
      "The Wolves wisely hunted Doncic on the other end of the floor, too, trying to exploit the weaknesses for a player whose defense is not an asset on a night when he clearly didn\u2019t have all of his strength to begin with.",
      "So what does this mean for the rest of the series now that the Lakers are trailing 2-1 and Doncic has only one full day to rest before an afternoon tip-off for Game 4?",
      "\u201cHopefully, whatever\u2019s going on, he feels better on Sunday,\u201d Redick said. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d",

      "Shedeur Sanders was among the best available players remaining after his Round 1 snub and as the draft heads into its final four rounds Saturday, the former University of Colorado star is still waiting to hear his name called",
      "Plenty of playmakers remain for teams to pick through Saturday in the NFL draft's final four rounds, Shedeur Sanders stunningly among them.",
      "Sanders is the biggest name still on the board more than 48 hours after he was widely expected to hear his name called, a spectacular slide for a quarterback who has gotten snubbed through 102 selections so far.",
      "Even before plunging through Day 2 on Friday, the former Colorado star's plight caught the attention of the White House.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump criticized teams for not selecting Sanders on Day 1 and suggested he should be picked immediately in Round 2.",
      "NFL franchises, however, plucked 70 more players from the college ranks and left Sanders still waiting for his phone to ring.",
      "Sanders and Miami's Cam Ward were considered the top two passing prospects in this year's draft with some analysts even rating Sanders higher than Ward, whom the Tennessee Titans made the top overall pick Thursday night.",
      "Four other quarterbacks have leap-frogged Sanders. In a surprise in the first round, the Giants took Jaxson Dart of Ole Miss. And in Round 2, the Saints selected Louisville's Tyler Shough, who began his college career at Oregon in 2018 and who will be 26 in September, and two more QBs went in the third round: Alabama's Jalen Milroe to the Seahawks and Oregon's Dillon Gabriel to the Browns.",
      "At best, Sanders will be the sixth QB drafted in 2025, and he won't even be the first Sanders selected. That honor went to South Carolina defensive tackle T.J. Sanders (no relation), who went 41st overall in Round 2 to Buffalo.",
      "One possible reason cited for Shedeur Sanders' slide is his size \u2014 6-foot-1, which is short for a QB by today's standards \u2014 and yet, Gabriel is even shorter at 5-11 and 201 pounds, 15 pounds lighter than Sanders, who's an accurate thrower and quick processor but who took a combined 94 sacks in his two seasons in Boulder.",
      "One team that isn't looking for a quarterback after finally landing one a year ago is the Denver Broncos, and their coach, Sean Payton, expressed dismay at Sanders' slide into Day 3 of this year's draft.",
      "\u201cThere will be this chip on his shoulder and beware because this guy's going to play in this league,\" Payton said. \"... yeah, I think it's surprising.\u201d",
      "Sanders is the highest-ranked player left on the board of several draft analysts, including the NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah, who has him as the 20th-ranked prospect, and ESPN senior writer Jeff Legwold, who ranked Sanders 32nd in his annual ranking of the top 100 college prospects.",
      "Legwold noted that although Sanders' nearly 72% completion rate in two seasons at Colorado was an FBS career record, he is undersized and doesn't throw the ball quickly, which led to many of the FBS-leading 94 sacks he took the last two seasons.",
      "Among the other best available prospects when the draft resumes with the Titans choosing 103rd overall are 5-foot-8 Tennessee running back Dylan Sampson, who scored a school-record 22 touchdowns last season, and Arizona State's bruising running back Cam Skattebo, who rushed for 1,711 yards and 21 TDs last season.",
      "Other top candidates for Round 4 include LSU guard Miles Frazier, Ohio State edge rusher Jack Sawyer and Colorado State wide receiver Tory Horton.",

      "Wyatt Langford had three hits and an RBI to help the Rangers win in manager Bruce Bochy\u2019s return to Oracle Park.",
      "Eovaldi (2-2) allowed three hits and had seven strikeouts with one walk in his 300th career game in the majors while outdueling three-time Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander. The walk was just the third allowed by Eovaldi in 36 2/3 innings this season.",
      "Chris Martin retired four batters, Robert Garcia set down three and Luke Jackson worked the ninth for his eighth save.",
      "Wilmer Flores came close to tying the game in the ninth when his long drive to left went foul. Jackson then threw an 88 mph slider past Flores for the final out.",
      "Verlander (0-2), whose 21 career victories against the Rangers are second against Texas, allowed two runs and five hits in six innings.",
      "Bochy, who guided the Giants to three World Series championships, was welcomed back into town and greeted with a rousing ovation from the Oracle Park crowd. He spent much of pregame talking with fans and signing autographs.",
      "After Langford\u2019s RBI-double in the sixth inning was challenged by the Giants and overturned into a ground-rule double with no run scored, Joc Pederson drove in his first run of the season when he hit a slow roller that glanced off the glove of Giants\u2019 second baseman Tyler Fitzgerald and rolled into right field.",
      "Verlander generated 13 swing-and-misses on the 89 pitches he threw. Verlander\u2019s season-high for whiffs is 20, which he did iagainst the Cincinnati Reds in his first start with the Giants.",
      "Rangers RHP Tyler Mahle (3-0, 0.68 ERA) was set to face Giants LHP Robbie Ray (3-0, 4.07) on Saturday.",

He went 9 for 10 from the free throw line and hustled all over the floor, leading the charge in a 56-26 edge the Wolves had in points in the paint.",
      "Doncic was frequently smothered by McDaniels, Minnesota\u2019s ace perimeter defender, and had a particularly sluggish start. Doncic needed a step-back 28-footer with Edwards guarding him in the closing seconds of the first half to get to eight points at the break.",
      "The Target Center crowd that watched Doncic dismantle Minnesota\u2019s league-leading defense for Dallas in the Western Conference finals last spring was delighted to see the demonstrative five-time All-NBA pick struggle. He didn\u2019t have much opportunity to play the villain, struggling to create clean shots and barely bothering to talk much trash.",
      "The Wolves wisely hunted Doncic on the other end of the floor, too, trying to exploit the weaknesses for a player whose defense is not an asset on a night when he clearly didn\u2019t have all of his strength to begin with.",
      "Rudy Gobert never got a single shot off but was a pest on defense as usual, poking the ball away from Doncic at the top of the key on one possession in the third quarter to start a fast break that McDaniels finished with a layup and a foul on Doncic for a three-point play and an 80-75 lead.",
      "That sequence that had the fans roaring came shortly after Edwards, who otherwise struggled to finish his drives to the basket, dunked over Doncic after adjusting the ball in mid-flight to avoid the block.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A lawsuit against Florida's ban on \u201clab-grown\u201d meat is still alive after a federal judge tossed four parts of the suit on Friday but kept a fifth.",
      "Northern District of Florida Chief Judge Mark Walker declined to dismiss a part of the lawsuit that argued Florida's restrictions give an unconstitutional advantage to Florida farmers over out-of-state competitors. Meanwhile, the judge sided with state attorneys seeking to dismiss the lawsuit and their argument that federal approval of cultivated chicken doesn't mean individual states can't ban it.",
      "U.S. regulators first signed off on the sale of what\u2019s known as \u201ccell-cultured\u201d or \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d meat in June 2023. The lawsuit had argued that Florida\u2019s law is preempted under federal laws that regulate the interstate market for meat and poultry products. Sellers say the product is a more ethical and sustainable alternative to conventionally raised chicken, beef and pork.",
      "But lawmakers in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have called cultivated meat a threat to their states\u2019 agriculture industries and banned the sale of the product, which is made of animal cells that are fed a mix of proteins, vitamins and water and then formed into nuggets, sausages and steaks.",
      "The lawsuit was filed last year by Upside Foods, represented by the nonprofit law firm the Institute for Justice.",
      "\u201cUpside is not looking to replace conventional meat, which will always have a place at the table,\u201d Upside CEO Uma Valeti said in a statement. \"All we are asking for is the right to compete, so that Floridians can try our product and see that it is possible to have delicious meat without the need for slaughtering animals. Today\u2019s ruling is an important step toward securing that right.\u201d",
      "The governor's office and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the lawsuit.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis was flanked by cattle farmers last May when he signed the state\u2019s cultivated meat ban into law.",
      "\u201cWe stand with agriculture, we stand with the cattle ranchers, we stand with our farmers because we understand it\u2019s important for the backbone of the state,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cTake your fake lab-grown meat elsewhere.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "X, the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- X Corp., the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates, saying it violates First Amendment speech protections.",
      "The company's federal lawsuit filed this week also contends that the 2023 state law is preempted by a 1996 federal statute that shields social media from being held responsible for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cWhile the law's reference to banning \u2018deep fakes\u2019 might sound benign, in reality it would criminalize innocuous, election-related speech, including humor, and make social-media platforms criminally liable for censoring such speech,\" the company said in a statement. \u201cInstead of defending democracy, this law would erode it.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's law imposes criminal penalties \u2014 including jail time \u2014 for disseminating a deepfake video, image or audio if a person knows it's fake, or acts with reckless disregard to its authenticity, either within 90 days before a party nominating convention, or after the start of early voting in a primary or general election.",
      "It says the intent must be to injure a candidate or influence an election result. And it defines deepfakes as material so realistic that a reasonable person would believe it's real, and generated by artificial intelligence or other technical means.",
      "\u201cElon Musk funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the 2024 presidential election and tried to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat,\" said the law's author, Democratic state Sen. Erin Maye Quade.",
      "\"Of course he is upset that Minnesota law prevents him from spreading deepfakes that meant to harm candidates and influence elections. Minnesota\u2019s law is clear and precise, while this lawsuit is petty, misguided and a waste of the Attorney General Office\u2019s time and resources,\u201d her statement said.",
      "Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is legally obligated to defend the constitutionality of state laws in court, said in a statement that it's \u201creviewing the lawsuit and will respond in the appropriate time and manner.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota law was already the subject of a constitutional challenge by Christopher Kohls, a content creator, and GOP state Rep. Mary Franson, who likes to post AI-generated parodies of politicians. That case is on hold while they appeal to overturn a judge's denial of their request to suspend the law.",
      "The attorney general's office argues in that case that deepfakes are a real and growing threat to free elections and democratic institutions, that the law is a legitimate and constitutional response to the problem, and that it contains important limitations on its scope that protect satire and parody.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, said it's the only social media platform challenging the Minnesota law, and that it has also challenged other laws it considers infringements of free speech, such as a 2024 California political deepfakes law that a judge has blocked.",
      "X said in its statement that its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d feature allows users to flag content they consider problematic, and that it's been adopted by Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. The company's lawsuit said its \u201cAuthenticity Policy\u201d and \u201cGrok AI\u201d tool provide additional safeguards.",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on technology law, said in an interview Friday that it's important to separate the free-speech issues from whatever one thinks about the controversial Musk.",
      "\u201cI'm almost positive that this will be struck down,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "There's no exception under the First Amendment for false or misleading political speech, even lies, he said. And the potential for criminal penalties gives social media companies like X and Facebook \u201can incentive to take down anything that might be a deepfake. ... You're going to censor a massive amount to comply with this law.\u201d",
      "Deepfakes aren't good, but it would be nice to get evidence that they're causing actual problems before imposing such limits on free speech, the professor said. And while it's easy to focus on the supply of misinformation, the large demand for it is the problem.",
      "\u201cPeople want to be fooled, and it's very bad for our democracy, but it\u2019s not something I think can be solved with a deepfakes ban,\" he said.",

      "Google\u2019s first-quarter performance illustrated the continuing power of its long-dominant search engine in a sea of uncertainty. While grappling with competitive threats emerging as artificial intelligence reshapes technology, Google is also battling court decisions condemning its search engine and digital ad network as illegal monopolies.",
      "The AI-driven upheaval has opened new opportunities for people to find helpful advice, insights and information through more conversational search options from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "Google's long-dominant search engine is countering the new competition with a feature called AI Overviews that appear above web links in its results. It is also testing a conversational tool called AI Mode that would usher in an even more radical change to its business model.",
      "\u201cThe company delivered a sound response to those questioning the solidity of the search business amid ever-increasing AI demand,\u201d Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said.",
      "But Google is trying to keep its business intact as by the U.S. Justice Department attempts to break up the company and impose other restraints after a federal judge last year branded its search engine an illegal monopoly. To make matters worse, its digital ad network also was found to be illegally abusing its power earlier this month in another case brought by the Justice Department.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has injected more uncertainty into the mix by rattling the financial markets amid fears the tariffs will reignite inflation while dragging the economy into a recession. Although Google\u2019s digital services aren\u2019t directly impacted by the tariffs, a recession would likely curtail the spending on ads that generate most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue.",
      "But there were few signs of a slowdown in the past quarter. Google's ad revenue during the period totaled $72.5 billion, an 11% increase from the same time a year ago.",
      "The steady growth emboldened Alphabet to stand firm on plans to invest $75 billion on AI and other technologies this year while also pursuing approval of a $32 billion deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz.",

      "BYD first built up its expertise in battery technology, now its biggest advantage as the world\u2019s largest-selling EV maker. Some others are technology companies allied with automakers to offer autonomous driving.",
      "Here are some of the key players:",
      "Great Wall Motors, with the Haval, Wey, Ora, Poer and Tank brands, is banking on overseas sales to keep growing after seeing its sales inside China fall by nearly 15% last year, even as the company\u2019s net profit jumped more than 80%. The company has factories in Russia, Thailand and Brazil, where it is challenging Toyota\u2019s popular Hilux pickup truck with its GWM Poer, a hybrid pickup of its own. Another mainstay is the Haval H6, a hybrid sports SUV.",

      "\u201cIt is essential for volume to be big, otherwise the cost of production is too high,\u201d Great Wall\u2019s chairman, Wei Jianjun, said in a media huddle at the show. Wei, who also goes by the name Jack Wey, was born in Beijing but moved to nearby Hebei, home of the Great Wall. He led the company\u2019s transition from vehicle modification to automaking, becoming China\u2019s biggest maker of pickup trucks and a leading SUV maker. The company has a joint venture for EVs with BMW.",
      "State-owned Chery Automobile says it was the first Chinese automaker to export overseas. It has sold more than 15 million of its Chery, Exeed, Omoda and Jetour models overseas, mostly in the developing world and emerging markets, including Turkey and Ukraine. Chery reported selling 2.6 million vehicles overseas last year and is aiming for 3 million in 2025. It\u2019s quickly expanding overseas production, setting up factories in Russia and Spain. It is expanding rapidly in Latin America.",
      "Chery\u2019s tie-up with EV-maker Visionary Vehicles aimed to sell in North America but has not yet achieved that goal. The company has a 50-50 joint venture with Jaguar Land Rover, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors of India that makes Jaguars and Land Rovers in China. It also collaborates with Huawei Technologies and e-commerce giant Alibaba.",

      "BYD made more electric vehicles last year than Tesla, selling 3.52 million EVs in China, up 28% from a year earlier. Its strength in plug-in hybrids has helped as Chinese increasingly opt for the fallback of a fuel engine.",
      "The company, based in southern China's Shenzhen, recently announced an ultra-fast EV charging system it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about as long as a fill-up. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",

      "Geely Auto is perhaps the most famous Chinese automaker that many people have never heard of. The privately held company was founded as a refrigerator-maker by businessman Li Shufu in 1997 in eastern China\u2019s Taizhou, which early on became a hub of private industry.",
      "Li began making strategic overseas acquisitions early on, buying Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car Co. from Ford Motor in 2010. Geely's purchase of a 49.9% stake in Malaysia\u2019s Proton gave it a 51% stake in luxury sports car brand Lotus.

The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",
      "Colleges\u2019 financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump\u2019s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.",
      "Last week, the Education Department demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing \u201cincomplete and inaccurate disclosures.\u201d Trump's administration is sparring with Harvard over the university's refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "In the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.",
      "The Trump administration intends to \u201cend the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions\u201d and protect against \u201cforeign exploitation,\u201d the order said.",
      "It was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and \u201cindoctrinate students.\u201d",
      "Another order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.\u201d",
      "Often overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges\u2019 governing boards to classroom curriculum.",
      "Trump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown.",
      "Trump\u2019s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.",
      "The president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump\u2019s order said it should be \u201ctransparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates\u2019 performance in the labor market,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.",
      "Trump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to \u201ccommon sense school discipline,\u201d allowing decisions to be based solely on students\u2019 behavior and actions, McMahon said.",
      "Another executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on \u201cdisparate impact theories.\u201d Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.",
      "In many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d \u2014 the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later.",
      "Federal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump\u2019s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don\u2019t receive federal money.",
      "Another order creates a federal task force focused on giving America\u2019s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.",
      "Trump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools\u2019 workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.",

      "Elon Musk intends to focus more on his job as Tesla CEO, but it\u2019s unclear if the billionaire will be able to solve a big problem of his own making: damage to its brand",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk has been called a Moonshot Master, the Edison of Our Age and the Architect of the Future, but he's got a big problem at his car company and it's not clear he can fix it: damage to its brand.",
      "Sales have plunged for Tesla amid protests and boycotts over Musk's embrace of far right-wing views. Profits have been sliced by two-thirds so far this year, and rivals from China, Europe and the U.S. are pouncing.",
      "On Tuesday came some relief as Musk announced in an earnings call with investors that he would be scaling back his government cost-cutting job in Washington to a \u201cday or two per week\" to focus more on his old job as Tesla's boss.",
      "Investors pushed up Tesla's stock 5% Wednesday, though there are plenty of challenges ahead.",
      "Musk seemed to downplay the role that brand damage played in the drop in first-quarter sales on the investor call. Instead, he emphasized something more fleeting \u2014 an upgrade to Tesla's best-selling Model Y that forced a shutdown of factories and pinched both supply and demand.",
      "While financial analysts following the company have noted that potential buyers probably held back while waiting for the upgrade, hurting results, even the most bullish among them say the brand damage is real, and more worrisome.",
      "\u201cThis is a full blown crisis,\u201d said Wedbush Securities' normally upbeat Dan Ives earlier this month. In a note to its clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\"",
      "Musk dismissed the protests against Tesla on the call as the work of people angry at his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency because \u201cthose who are receiving the waste and fraud wish it to continue.\u201d",
      "But the protests in Europe, thousands of miles from Washington, came after Musk supported far-right politicians there. Angry Europeans hung Musk in effigy in Milan, projected an image of him doing a straight-arm salute on a Tesla factory in Berlin and put up posters in London urging people not to buy \u201cSwasticars\u201d from him.",
      "Sales in Europe have gone into a free fall in the first three months of this year \u2014 down 39%. In Germany, sales plunged 62%.",
      "Another worrying sign: On Tuesday, Tesla backed off its earlier promise that sales would recover this year after dropping in 2024 for the first time a dozen years. Tesla said the global trade situation was too uncertain and declined to repeat the forecast.",
      "Meanwhile, Tesla's competition is stealing its customers.",
      "Among its fiercest rivals now is Chinese giant BYD. Earlier this year, the EV maker announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla\u2019s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk.",
      "Tesla's share of the EV market in the U.S. has dropped from two-thirds to less than half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Another rival, Google parent Alphabet, is already ahead of Tesla in an area that Musk has promised will help remake his company: Cybercabs.",
      "One of the highlights of Tesla\u2019s call Tuesday was Musk sticking with his previous prediction that it will l aunch driverless cabs without steering wheels and pedals in Austin, Texas, in June, and in other cities soon after.",
      "But Google\u2019s service, called Waymo, already has logged millions of driverless cybercab trips in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Musk also told analysts that this driverless capability will be available on the Tesla vehicles already on the road through software updates over the air, and put a timeline on it: \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year.\"",
      "But he has made similar promises before, only to miss his deadlines, such as in April 2019 when he vowed full automation by the end of the next year. He repeated the prediction, moving up the date, several more times, in following years.",
      "A big problem is federal investigators have not given the all-clear that Tesla vehicles can drive completely on their own safely. Among other probes, safety regulators are looking into Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving, for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.",
      "In competition with rivals in the U.S., Tesla currently has one clear advantage: It will get hurt by less by tariffs because most of its vehicles are built in the countries where they are sold, including those in its biggest market, the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs are still tough on a company where margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains,\u201d Musk said Tuesday. \u201cThat puts us in a strong position.\u201d",
      "The company also reconfirmed that a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be ready for customers in the first half of this year. That could help boost sales.",
      "Another plus: The company had a blow out first quarter in its energy storage business. And Musk has promised to be producing 5,000 Optimus robots, another Tesla business, by the end of the year.",
      "Even after falling nearly 50% from its December highs, Tesla's stock is still very richly valued based on the one yardstick that really matters in the long run: its earnings.",
      "At 110 times its expected per share earnings this year, the stock is valued more than 25 times higher than General Motors. The average stock on in the S&P 500 index trades at less than 20 times earnings.",
      "That leaves Tesla little margin for error if something goes wrong.",

      "The legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.",
      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",
      "In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.",
      "According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cWe have confidence in the validity of the (multiple-choice questions) to accurately and fairly assess the legal competence of test-takers,\u201d Leah Wilson, the State Bar\u2019s executive director, told the newspaper in a statement.",
      "Katie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, told the newspaper, \u201cIt\u2019s a staggering admission.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.\u201d",

      "\u201cUltimately, I\u2019m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it\u2019s created,\u201d said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",

      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",
      "\u201cI like OpenAI\u2019s mission to \u2018ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\u2019 and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,\" Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. \"I\u2019m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "Conflicts over OpenAI's purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman's short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.",
      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",
      "Software engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit charter is a \u201cstop-and-assist clause\u201d that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.",

      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "Last year was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, and much of that is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 20.87 degrees Celsius (69.57 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

      "Scientists say a newly discovered green comet likely has broken apart and won\u2019t be visible to the naked eye",
      "NEW YORK -- A newly discovered green comet tracked by telescopes has likely broken apart as it swung by the sun, dashing hopes of a naked-eye spectacle.",
      "Comet SWAN, hailing from the Oort Cloud beyond Pluto, has been visible through telescopes and binoculars over the past few weeks with its streaming tail, but experts said it may not have survived its recent trip past the sun and is fading fast.",
      "\u201cWe'll soon be left with just a dusty rubble pile,\u201d astrophysicist Karl Battams with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory said in an email.",
      "Comets are balls of frozen gas and dust from billions of years ago. Every so often, a comet passes through the inner solar system.",
      "\u201cThese are relics from when the solar system first formed,\u201d said Jason Ybarra, director of the West Virginia University Planetarium and Observatory.",
      "The newest comet was discovered by amateur astronomers, who spied it in photos taken by a camera on a spacecraft operated by NASA and the European Space Agency to study the sun.",
      "The comet won't swing close to Earth like Tsuchinshan-Atlas did last year. Other notable flybys included Neowise in 2020 and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the 1990s.",
      "The comet, also designated C/2025 F2, would have been visible just after dark slightly north of where the sun set. Its green color would have been difficult to see with the naked eye.",
      "This might have been the object\u2019s first ever trip past the sun, making it particularly vulnerable to breaking apart, Battams said. After its flyby, what's left of the comet will disappear into the outer reaches of the solar system, past where scientists think it came from.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to go so far out that we have no idea if it\u2019s ever going to return,\u201d said Battams.",

      "Instagram is beginning to test the use of artificial intelligence to determine if kids are lying about their ages on the app, parent company Meta Platforms said on Monday.",
      "Meta has been using AI to determine people's ages for some time, the company said, but photo and video-sharing app will now \u201cproactively\u201d look for teen accounts it suspects belong to teenagers even if they entered an inaccurate birthdate when they signed up.",
      "If it is determined that a user is misrepresenting their age, the account will automatically become a teen account, which has more restrictions than an adult account. Teen accounts are private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. \u201cSensitive content,\u201d such as videos of people fighting or those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited, Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a \u201csleep mode\u201d will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m.",
      "Meta says it trains its AI to look for signals, such as the type of content the account interacts, profile information and when the account was created, to determine the owner's age.",
      "The heightened measures arrive as social media companies face increased scrutiny over how their platform affects the mental health and well-being of younger users. A growing number of states are also trying to pass age verification laws, although they have faced court challenges.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don\u2019t do enough to make their products safe for children \u2014 or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "Instagram will also send notifications to parents \u201cwith information about how they can have conversations with their teens on the importance of providing the correct age online,\" the company said.",

      "As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry\u2019s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn\u2019t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House less than 100 days ago",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other potentially detrimental actions.",
      "It's the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when they assembled behind Trump as he was sworn in.",
      "That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunities in artificial intelligence and deal-making.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s policies so far have vexed Big Tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies \u2014 a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20.",
      "The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.",
      "That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.",
      "Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump's tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators' allegations that Meta has been running an illegal monopoly in social networking, and working to persuade a federal judge to break up Google after its search engine last year was found to be illegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobble Apple and Amazon.",
      "And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company to record a $5.5 billion charge to account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country.",
      "Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies\u2019 financial reports for the January-March quarter.",
      "The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the same time last year.",
      "The decline occurred against a backdrop of vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies.",
      "After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla's market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: Amazon on April 29; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Apple on May 1.",
      "Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results.",

      "Google will confront an existential threat Monday as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into a ruthless monopoly.",
      "The drama will unfold in a Washington courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser.",
      "The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade.",
      "After the case finally went to trial in 2023, a federal judge last year ruled Google had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software.",
      "That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google\u2019s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers.",
      "Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. \u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.\u201d",
      "Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden's term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google's immense power as a threat to freedom, too.",
      "\u201cThe American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and \u2018free\u2019 online services,\" the Justice Department wrote in a March 7 filing with Mehta. \u201cThese values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist.\"",
      "Google is arguing the government's proposed changes are unwarranted under a ruling that its search engine popularity among consumers is one of the main reasons it has become so dominant.",
      "The \u201cunprecedented array of proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\u201d Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. \u201cThey bear little or no relationship to the conduct found anticompetitive, and are contrary to the law.\u201d",
      "Google also is sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. \u201cThe breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers.\"",
      "The showdown over Google's fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals.",
      "The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup \u2014 a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court.",
      "Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta's ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can't do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day.",
      "The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social media in another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against both Apple and Amazon, too.",
      "The Justice Department also targeted Google's digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week in another federal judge's decision that found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year.",

      "Iranian state television reported the talks had begun in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. However, neither Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi nor U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff offered any immediate specifics or details on the talks that they'll lead.",
      "Araghchi arrived Friday in Oman and met with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome. Araghchi then visited the Muscat International Book Fair, surrounded by television cameras and photojournalists. Video late Saturday morning showed Araghchi heading to the talks.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the devastating Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.",
      "\u201cThe Iran situation is coming out very well,\u201d Trump said on Air Force One. \u201cWe've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.\"",

      "From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran\u2019s expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.",
      "The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America\u2019s efforts in the 2015 talks.",
      "Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop.

    "story": [
      "He told Time magazine negotiations would be \"finished\" in 3-4 weeks.",
      "President Donald Trump, in a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine published Friday, claimed he's already \"made 200 deals\" on tariffs and said he's spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "In the cover story, in which Trump's discussed his first 100 days in office, the president was asked about White House trade adviser Peter Navarro\u2019s prediction of \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "\"I\u2019ve made 200 deals,\" Trump said. When asked to confirm that number, Trump said \"100%.\"",
      "Trump, though, would not elaborate on what countries he's solidified deals with or the terms. He's met with various foreign officials at the White House in recent weeks on tariffs and other economic issues, but has not yet announced any agreements.",
      "\"I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way,\" Trump told Time. \"We'll be finished.\"",
      "On the issue of China -- which faces the highest tariff rate from the administration -- Trump said President Xi has called him.",
      "\"He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf,\" Trump said.",
      "The White House in recent days has softened its stance on China, telling reporters that talks with Beijing were moving in the right direction. But Chinese officials, before Trump's Time interview was published, disputed the White House's characterization.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Thursday called the administration's claims active discussions were happening \"fake news.\" On Friday, the Jiakun said \"China and the United States have not consulted or negotiated on the tariff issue\" and \"the United States should not confuse the public.\"",
      "As he left the White House on Friday, Trump was pressed multiple times by reporters to elaborate on the call with Xi he mentioned to Time but sidestepped. When asked specifically if he'd spoken to him since the tariffs, Trump said, \"I don't want to comment on that but I've spoken to him many times.\"",
      "Here are other key takeaways from the Time interview.",
      "Deportations and Kilmar Abrego Garcia",
      "Time reported that the idea of Trump sending migrants to El Salvador started back in the summer of 2024, when Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele invited lawmakers to visit the country's infamous CECOT. Matt Gaetz, then a Republican congressman from Florida, pitched the idea to Stephen Miller, who then floated the idea to Trump, according to Time, and a deal was quietly made in February.",
      "Trump told Time he liked the idea, in part, because he believed it would be \"a greater deterrent.\"",
      "Trump also told Time that he was originally \u201cnot happy\u201d that his administration had \u201cmistakenly\u201d deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia under the Alien Enemies Act, but then \"found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member.\" Abrego Garcia's family and attorney deny that claim.",
      "Trump said he has not asked Bukele to return Abrego Garcia despite the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return.",
      "Asked if Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court, Trump repeatedly said it's up to the Justice Department, but eventually said it wouldn\u2019t bother him if he received his due process.",
      "\"That\u2019s not my determination,\" Trump said. \"It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer.\"",
      "Russia-Ukraine war",
      "President Trump again blamed Kyiv for initiating the war they are in with Russia, saying Ukraine's desire to join NATO was to blame despite Russian President Vladimir Putin launching a full-scale invasion.",
      "Amid recent comments from Trump and other top officials that the U.S. could walk away from negotiations if a deal isn't reached soon, Trump projected optimism.",
      "\"We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal,\" he told Time.",
      "The negotiated peace Trump is pursuing would hand Putin some 20% of Ukrainian territory.",
      "\u201cCrimea will stay with Russia,\u201d Trump told the magazine.",
      "Trump was asked about his repeated comments of ending the war in Ukraine on Day 1 of his presidency. Trump argued he meant that \u201cfiguratively.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended.\u201d",

      "The WHI is a decadeslong research effort on women's health.",
      "The Trump administration has promised to restore funding to a landmark study on women's health days after researchers leading the study announced their funding had been cut -- news that prompted outcry from medical experts and scientists.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Friday to ABC News that it will restore funding to the Women's Health Initiative, a 30-year study of over 160,000 women that has led to discoveries in women's health on everything from cancer and hormone therapy to chronic disease, aging and osteoporosis.",
      "\"These studies represent critical contributions to our better understanding of women's health. While NIH initially exceeded its internal targets for contract reductions, we are now working to fully restore funding to these essential research efforts,\" the agency said in a statement, referring to the National Institutes of Health, the agency within HHS that oversees the study. \"The NIH remains deeply committed to advancing public health through rigorous gold standard research and we are taking immediate steps to ensure the continuity of these studies.\"",
      "Researchers leading the Women's Health Initiative, or WHI, announced earlier this week that they had been informed HHS would terminate contracts for the study's four regional centers at the end of September. Funding for the study's clinical coordinating center would continue through January 2026, according to the researchers, and then remain uncertain.",
      "Garnet Anderson, Ph.D., principal investigator of the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, told ABC News on Friday that the center has not received confirmation from the NIH that funding for the study will be restored.",
      "She added that while she hopes the funding for the WHI is restored, she is also worried that it may come at the expense of funding for \"other, equally deserving studies.\"",
      "\"The decision-making process now is opaque,\" Anderson told ABC News by email. \"It isn't clear that we are getting the best return on our investment -- prioritizing and supporting research on the most important issues in public health and the most promising scientific opportunities.\"",
      "Anderson's work on the WHI over the past 30 years included research on hormone therapy and women.",
      "Additional discoveries stemming from the decades' worth of data collected by the WHI include major information on preventing chronic disease in women; slowing memory loss; preventing and treating breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers in women; and better understanding of how conditions earlier in life like pregnancy, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes impact women later in life, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, one of the long-term principal investigators of the WHI.",
      "\"This is the largest and most groundbreaking study of women's health, and we're learning so much about prevention of chronic disease, healthy aging, extending health span, years of life that are free of major chronic diseases with good memory and cognition and mobility, and quality of life,\" Manson, who is also Preventive Medicine division chief at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a Harvard Medical School professor, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Manson said the research findings the WHI continues to produce have not only shaped public health guidelines and clinical health guidelines, meaning the medical advice doctors give to patients, but have also shaped a generation of researchers of women's health.",
      "\"There have been more than 5,000 investigators who have been involved with publications and with the science, and it will be difficult to keep that together,\" she said of the potential impact of the funding cuts. \"Also, the WHI has played an enormous role in training and mentoring the next generation of researchers in women's health and healthy aging that is likely to be disrupted.\"",

      "Manson and other researchers noted that the sudden announcement of the funding cuts and now the possible reversal to restore funding have thrown their work into chaos.",
      "\"We've got blood samples, literally hundreds of thousands of blood samples, that have been collected over the years. It isn't clear if those bio-specimens can be fully utilized and used to advance the science that is also threatened,\" Manson said, later adding, \"We need to see whether these bio-specimens can be preserved, whether they can still be made available for ancillary study by investigators around the country, whether new biomarkers can be measured in these blood samples -- it's really unclear.\"",
      "On Friday, Manson told ABC News that she has not received confirmation from the NIH that funding for the study would continue.",
      "A third WHI regional center, located at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, also told ABC News Friday it had not been informed by the NIH of a decision to restore funding.",
      "Dr. Marian Neuhouser, a principal investigator of the WHI at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said one of the primary duties of the study's regional centers, whose funding was originally set to be terminated in September, is to continually collect data from the tens of thousands of women still enrolled in the study.",
      "\"There aren't many studies that have such a large database of older women. We have something like 13,000 women over the age of 90 and some up to age 108,\" Neuhouser told ABC News on Thursday. \"We need to learn about these women -- what keeps them healthy, what puts them at risk, how people can remain living independently. This information helps clinicians as they interact with patients.\"",
      "She added of the women enrolled in the WHI, \"They want to be studied. They want to be part of the answer.\"",
      "Experts like Neuhouser note that the work of the WHI is landmark in part because as recently as three decades ago, women were not required to be included in medical research.",
      "In the 1970s, for example, the first clinical studies on the effects of estrogen -- the sex hormone responsible for female physical features and reproduction -- were done on men.",
      "It was only with the passage of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act in 1993, signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton, that the inclusion of women and people of color became required in federally funded research.",

There's room for movement; 3 in 10 in an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released Friday said they don't know enough about the case to say.",
      "Overall, 46% said they approve of the way Trump is handling immigration, while 53% said they disapprove. On one hand, that's a 4-point drop in approval from a Washington Post/Ipsos poll in February. On the other, it's Trump's best rating across seven issues tested in this survey, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos.",
      "See PDF for full results.",
      "There's about an even division, moreover, on Trump's efforts to deport undocumented immigrants in general. Forty-eight percent said Trump is \"going too far\" in this regard, while 50% said he's either handling it about right (34%) or not going far enough (16%).",
      "There's also a close split on the deportation of suspected gang members to an El Salvador prison without a court hearing: Forty-seven percent said they support this action, while 51% said they opposed.",

      "About 9 in 10 Republicans said they approve of Trump's handling of immigration, while 1 in 10 Democrats said they approved. Among independents, 45% said they approve.",
      "Trump also wins approval on immigration from 93% of his 2024 voters, compared with 8% of those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, he falls well short among those who didn't vote for president in the 2024 elections, who disapprove of Trump on immigration by 59%-40%.",
      "In another broad partisan gap, 85% of Democrats said they think Trump is \"going too far\" with deportations. Sixty percent of Republicans said they think he's handling this about right -- and 27% said he's not going far enough. Independents again fall in between.",
      "Republicans' attitudes are not monolithic. Eighty-two percent said they support sending suspected gang members to a prison in El Salvador without court hearings. Fewer, but still 70%, said they support deporting international college students who are critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Fewer still, 53%, said Abrego Garcia should remain in El Salvador, though just 14% said they favor his return, with the rest unsure.",
      "Hispanic people said they disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration overall, by 67%-32%. Men divided about evenly on the issue, while most women said they disapprove, 58%-41%. Approval on the issue ranges from 65% of people in rural areas to 45% in suburbs and 36% in cities, with sizable rural and suburban gender gaps.",

Instead, he said, \"I think there is enough of that want of generational change,\" adding that it is not about age but about people wanting their members of Congress \"to be accessible and accountable and to actually meet voters where they are emotionally.\"",
      "Sherman, speaking to ABC News, dismissed Rakov -- who he indicated had not worked with him directly -- as one of an expected number of challengers.",
      "\"I always have lots of opponents and I usually win by a huge margin,\" Sherman said.",
      "More generally, Sherman sounded a skeptical note on the efforts to primary incumbents more generally.",
      "\"I see these efforts to turn the Democratic Party into a circular firing squad \u2026 It's very difficult to see how their efforts will help us win the 2026 elections. What it means is that we waste a lot of money in the primaries,\" he said.",
      "In Indiana's 7th Congressional District, which includes much of Indianapolis, George Hornedo, a 34-year-old alum of the Obama administration and Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign, is challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson. Hornedo alleges that Carson, 50, who was first elected to the House in 2008, has not delivered for the district.",
      "\"I'm running because my community here in Indianapolis is still waiting for everything from safer streets to affordable housing to, really, just real leadership,\" Hornedo told ABC News. \"After nearly 20 years in Congress, it's clear that Congressman Carson is just holding the seat but not actually doing anything with it.\"",
      "But Hornedo does not think the divide is simply about age or time in office. The split, he said, is between members \"like Congressman Carson\" who think the current institutions in place are working for people, \"versus those like myself that acknowledge that, of course, we have to try and protect what we currently have, but we also have to acknowledge that President Trump and Elon Musk are actively dismantling government day in and day out.\"",
      "Carson told ABC News he welcomes new voices but thinks that Democrats need to work together under a common goal -- and he pushed back against Hornedo's claims.",
      "Carson pointed to the bills he's worked on that have been signed into law, as well as his work across the aisle with Republicans and the federal funding he has delivered to Indianapolis as testament to his effectiveness.",
      "But Carson also believes his own background makes him a nontraditional member of Congress already: \"I think I'm one of the few members of Congress that have ever lived in a homeless shelter \u2026 along with my grandmother, I was raised by the community. I was raised by the village, and so I'm always sensitive to the needs of the downtrodden and the less fortunate.\"",
      "In nearby Illinois, Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a former reporter and researcher with a large social media following, announced in March that she would run for Congress in Illinois' 9th Congressional District -- currently represented by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, 80, who has not yet announced if she will run for reelection.",
      "Abughazaleh has had some early success on the fundraising front, raising more than $375,000 in the first week of her campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. She outraised what Schakowsky fundraised in the entire first quarter.",
      "Abughazaleh is quick to emphasize that her run is not a \"vendetta\" against the incumbent -- but she says the Democratic Party is discouraging primaries and critiques in general.",
      "\"It's time for new ideas. If what we were doing was working, then we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place,\" Abughazaleh told ABC News.",
      "Abughazaleh pointed to her own life experiences that dovetail with what younger generations are experiencing -- as someone from a generation dealing with school shooting drills, out-of-pocket medical costs, and spending most of her income on rent -- as differentiating herself from longtime members.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Schakowsky said she will decide on her own plans \"soon, but if I do indeed decide to retire, there are dozens of talented leaders, advocates, and organizers in the 9th Congressional District who know our community and who are ready to lead the charge as we fight back against the extreme MAGA regime and Trump's shameful policies.\"",
      "She also said she has \"always encouraged more participation in the democratic process.\"",
      "On Wednesday, she posted on X that she still had not yet made a decision about running.",

      "Blair is now setting his sights on his next role in public office.",
      "\"I'm running because District 13, my home turf, deserves better leadership. And I think we learned a very important lesson in November and we need to respond immediately to the chaos of this administration with stronger, more competent and forceful leadership,\" Blair told ABC News in an interview.",
      "Incumbent Rep. David Scott has held the seat for 22 years, following a career in the Georgia General Assembly. Blair argues that Georgia's 13th Congressional District needs a leader who is \"agile and present\" -- qualities he no longer sees in Scott.",
      "\"When somebody's served in elected office for over 50 years, there comes a time where you have to ask when you're actually ready to prepare the next generation of leadership.\"",

      "A former Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur and founding engineer of the online payment platform Stripe, Chakrabarti got his start in politics working on Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "Asked why he believes he can unseat a party heavyweight, Chakrabarti told ABC News he's done it before. He served as campaign manager for Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez during her 2018 upset victory over Democratic incumbent Joe Crowley.",
      "Chakrabarti sees echoes of 2018 in 2025: a post-Trump election environment marked by frustration among Democrats over their party's defeat.",
      "\"That moment of change, in my opinion, is dwarfed by the moment of change you see right now. The level of anger at the Democratic Party for failing is huge,\" Chakrabarti said.",
      "Chakrabarti added that those who want to stand up to Trump should also have the courage to stand up to members of their own party, including Pelosi, 85.",
      "\"The one thing we know is if we go into 2028 with the party being what it is right now, we're in trouble,\" Chakrabarti said.",

      "Booker, the strategist, told ABC News that the younger candidates generally will have the challenge of building up name recognition among voters -- who may already have strong connections to the incumbents.",
      "\"As humans, we are very connected to who our person is. A lot of these members that have been in these seats a long time also have deep relationships, and they also have a lot of money, and those deep relationships also extend to the donors,\" she said.",
      "\"So while I'm all about supporting young people to run, they have to be thoughtful \u2026 so they can actually have a well-oiled campaign, because otherwise they're going to be, yes, a challenger, but they're not going to be able to be successful in these runs for office.\"",

      "The sworn declaration by Carlos Cisneros, the assistant field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was unsealed by a federal judge in the Southern District of Texas who temporarily blocked the government from deporting Venezuelans held in the El Valle Detention Center in Texas earlier this month.",

      "An official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acknowledged that \"many\" of the men deported on March 15 lack criminal records in the United States -- but said that \"the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose\" and \"demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.\"",

      "It was connected to the internet on an unsecured commercial line, sources said.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used the Signal app on a personal computer in his office that was connected to the internet on an unsecured commercial line, what's known as a \"dirty line,\" two sources confirmed to ABC News Thursday.",
      "A \"dirty line\" is the nickname given to a commercial internet line that is used to connect to websites that would not be available on the Pentagon's unclassified (NIPR) or classified (SIPR) lines.",
      "This dirty line was installed at Hegseth's request so he could use the Signal app on the personal computer, the sources said.",
      "A commercial internet line does not have any of the firewall protections that the Defense Department's unclassified system has, so that makes it potentially susceptible to being monitored particularly if sensitive information is being communicated.",
      "The news was first reported by The Associated Press.",
      "Reached for comment about the existence of the dirty line in Hegseth's office, a DOD spokesperson referred to an earlier statement from Sean Parnell, the Pentagon's chief spokesperson.",
      "\"The Secretary of Defense's use of communications systems and channels is classified,\" said Parnell. \"However, we can confirm that the Secretary has never used and does not currently use Signal on his government computer.\"",
      "Following ABC News' report, Parnell posted online \"this is complete & total fake news.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth strongly denied that what he shared over a second group chat on the Signal messaging app were classified war plans about imminent U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi militants in Yemen, and blamed former staffers for leaking, accusing them of going to the news media with new information to \"sabotage\" Trump's agenda.",
      "Hegseth and other administration officials have insisted that the information about those airstrikes that was shared earlier with another Signal group established by national security adviser Mike Waltz was not classified.",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth continued to make that case as questions have been raised about how he shared similar information with a smaller Signal group that sources told ABC News included his wife, brother, and personal attorney.",
      "\"I look at war plans every single day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal unclassified coordination for media coordination other things. That's what I've said from the beginning,\" Hegseth said in a live interview from the Pentagon on \"Fox & Friends.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the chat had earlier told ABC News that Hegseth had established the Signal group with family and friends during his Senate confirmation process. Hegseth was not asked in the interview why he had shared the information with that group of close personal advisers that included his wife, who is not a U.S. government employee.",

    "story": [
      "Roughly 47% of Republicans think tariffs will negatively impact inflation.",
      "Seven in 10 Americans think President Donald Trump's tariffs on international trade will drive up U.S. inflation, outweighing hopes that they'll boost manufacturing employment and fueling a 64% disapproval rate of how he's handling the issue.",
      "Even nearly half of Republicans -- 47% in the ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released Friday -- said they think tariffs will negatively impact inflation. That jumps to 75% among independents, a swing group in national politics.",
      "The tariffs admittedly are a moving target. The administration has paused some (albeit not those on China) pending negotiations.",
      "And there is a perceived positive: 59% said they think the tariffs will have a positive impact on creating manufacturing jobs in the United States, including 90% of Republicans and 60% of independents. That, along with bringing prices down, were some of Trump's key campaign promises.",
      "But -- given the current state of play -- the scale tips negative again on a third factor: 56% in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, think Trump's handling of tariffs will negatively impact America's economic leadership in the world vs. 42% who see a positive impact.",
      "See PDF for full results.",
      "Democrats, for their part, are roundly opposed to the tariffs. Nine in 10 think they will negatively impact inflation (90%) and U.S. economic leadership in the world (89%) alike, and a near-unanimous 96% disapprove of Trump's handling of them. Democrats aren't sold on tariffs creating manufacturing jobs, either: 68% think they'll hurt, not help.",
      "Given inflation fears, Trump's overall rating for handling tariffs is a broad 30 percentage points underwater, 34%-64%. That's far worse than his 7-point deficit in approval on handling immigration (as reported here), demonstrating that public sentiment is especially prickly when economic well-being is on the line.",
      "Indeed, in his own party, 25% of Republicans disapprove of Trump's handling of tariffs, as do 30% of conservatives. And disapproval reaches 48% among non-college-educated white men and 47% of rural Americans, two of Trump's core support groups.",

      "Most haven\u2019t been shocked by the drama of Trump\u2019s first 100 days. About 7 in 10 U.S. adults say the first few months of Trump\u2019s second term have been mostly what they expected, and only about 3 in 10 say the Republican president\u2019s actions have been mostly unexpected.",
      "But that does not mean they are pleased with how those opening months have gone.",
      "In fact, Democrats seem even unhappier with the reality of the second Trump term than before he was sworn in on Jan. 20. About three-quarters of Democrats say Trump is focused on the wrong topics and about 7 in 10 think he has been a \u201cterrible\u201d president so far. That is an increase from January, when about 6 in 10 anticipated that he would be \u201cterrible.\u201d",

      "Republicans are largely standing behind the president, but are ambivalent about what he has chosen to emphasize. About 7 in 10 say he has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president. But only about half say he has mostly had the right priorities so far, while about one-quarter say it has been about an even mix and about 1 in 10 said Trump has mostly had the wrong priorities.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really doing the stuff that he said he was going to do,\u201d said Tanner Bergstrom, 29, a Republican from Minnesota. He is \u201cnot making a bunch of promises and getting into office and nothing happens. ... I really like that. Even if it\u2019s some stuff I don\u2019t agree with, it\u2019s still doing what he said he was going to do.\u201d",
      "Those who were surprised by Trump\u2019s first few months seem to have had a rude awakening. The people who say Trump\u2019s actions were not what they expected \u2014 who are mostly Democrats and independents \u2014 are more likely to say Trump has had mostly the wrong priorities and that he has been a poor or terrible president, compared with the people who mostly expected his actions.",
      "About 4 in 10 in the survey approve of how Trump is handling the presidency overall. The issue of immigration is a relative strength. According to the poll, 46% of U.S. adults approve of his handling of the issue, which is slightly higher than his overall approval. But there are also indications that foreign policy, trade negotiationsand the economy could prove problematic as he aims to prove his approach will benefit the country.",
      "Trump\u2019s approval on those issues is much lower than it is on immigration. Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of how he is handling each. Republicans are less likely to approve of Trump\u2019s approach to trade and the economy than immigration.",
      "There are additional signals that some Trump supporters may not be thrilled with his performance so far. The share of Republicans who say he has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president has fallen about 10 percentage points since January. They also have grown a bit more likely to say Trump will be either \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible,\u201d although only 16% describe his first few months that way.",
      "Republican Stephanie Melnyk, 45, from Tennessee, is supportive of Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency more broadly but said she did not approve of his handling of foreign affairs, particularly on the war in Ukraine. Melnyk\u2019s family emigrated from Ukraine and she said Trump is \u201ctrying for a quick fix that\u2019s not going to last\u201d and that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cis not to be trusted.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s common, though, for a president\u2019s standing to be at its best before taking office and beginning the work of governing. And Trump continues to hold high approval from Republicans.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a favorable opinion of Trump, roughly in line with his approval number. Among Republicans, the figure is about double: About 8 in 10 Republicans have a positive view of the president, and about the same share approves of how he is handling the presidency. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Vice President JD Vance, including about 7 in 10 Republicans.",
      "Those Republicans interviewed were particularly fond of efforts to scale back the size of the federal government led by billionaire outside adviser Elon Musk and Trump\u2019s cost-cutting initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\u201cOverall, I would have to say that I\u2019m happy with the Trump presidency,\u201d said Matthew Spencer, 30, a Republican from Texas. \u201cI think that the Department of Government Efficiency has made great strides in reducing our spending, and I also agree with putting America first. I agree with the policies he\u2019s put in as far as border protection and America standing for itself again as far as the tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re only three months in, but so far, so good,\u201d said Carlos Guevara, 46, who lives in Florida.

He arrived Saturday to Oman, where the talks were expected to start in the coming hours, a source familiar with Witkoff's travels told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on half a century of enmity.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the devastating Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.",
      "\u201cThe Iran situation is coming out very well,\u201d Trump said on Air Force One. \u201cWe've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.\"",
      "He added: \u201cThere are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal \u2014 a much nastier deal \u2014 and I don\u2019t want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.\u201d",
      "While Araghchi and Witkoff are again expected to speak through the Omanis, experts on both sides also will begin negotiating details of a possible deal.",
      "From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran\u2019s expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.",
      "The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America\u2019s efforts in the 2015 talks.",
      "Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. That demand all enrichment stop also has been repeated by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "However, Iranians remain hopeful the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took over 1 million rial to buy $1.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,\u201d Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. \u201cOf course we shouldn\u2019t give them everything. After all, we\u2019ve suffered a lot for this program.\u201d",

      "Russian-born scientist Kseniia Petrova has been detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement since February when she failed to declare frog embryo samples at Boston's Logan Airport",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Kseniia Petrova never imagined she would face significant immigration issues, but it has been 68 days since she was detained at the Boston airport while traveling with undeclared frog embryo samples.",
      "The Russian-born scientist and Harvard University researcher associate was in the United States legally. But she finds herself thrust into a detention system that has been in the national spotlight as President Donald Trump pursues his promise of mass deportations.",
      "Petrova, 30, was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana where she continues to await a judge's decision on whether she will be deported to Russia, where she fears she will be imprisoned or worse.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security accuses Petrova of knowingly breaking the law, while friends and advocates are calling for her release and saying the incident was an infraction that normally would be punishable by a fine.",
      "As Petrova spends days in a crowded dormitory awaiting her fate, her colleagues say their research, including using a one-of-a-kind cancer-detecting microscope, will be delayed or moot without the scientist who they say plays a critical role.",
      "\u201cThe truth is on my side,\u201d said Petrova, who spoke with The Associated Press on Friday in a video call from the Louisiana ICE detention center in Monroe. She held an outdated phone to one ear and pressed her fingers against the other trying to block out muffled background conversations in various languages.",
      "Behind Petrova were steel bunkbeds, a few tables, two microwaves and a television showing CNN.",
      "\u201cAlmost all our life is happening in this dorm,\u201d Petrova said.",
      "Dozens of woman walked around Petrova. She said many were Latin Americans, some who crossed the border illegally. Other immigrants had been in the country for a long time and were detained after missing a check-in with ICE. There are others who Petrova said were in the facility \"without any sense or any reason, really any point\" about why they were detained.",
      "Petrova is not aware of any other scientists in the dorm housing 99 women.",
      "Petrova described the facility's food as \"absolutely terrible\", mainly carbohydrates without fruits or vegetables. Detainees typically get an hour outside unless it's raining, a regular occurrence this time of year in the Bayou State.",
      "People spend the night shivering because the dorm is cold, the showers are painfully hot, privacy is absent and the constant noise makes it \u201chard to live,\" she said.",
      "A couple months earlier, Petrova had been vacationing in France, where she stopped at a lab specializing in splicing superfine sections of a frog embryos and obtained a package of samples to be used for research.",
      "As she passed through a customs checkpoint in Boston's Logan Airport, Petrova was questioned about the samples. Petrova told the AP she didn't realize the items needed to be declared and was not trying to sneak in anything. After an interrogation, Petrova was told her visa was being cancelled.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on X that Petrova was detained after \u201clying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.\u201d They allege messages on her phone \u201crevealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them.\"",
      "Petrova's boss and mentor, Leon Peshkin, said the samples were not in any way dangerous or biohazardous.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think she did anything wrong,\u201d Peshkin told the AP. \u201cBut even if she did, at most she should have gotten a warning or maybe a fine of up to $500.\u201d",
      "Harvard said in a statement that the university \u201ccontinues to monitor the situation.\u201d",
      "Petrova has a very special scientific skill set required by the work, said Peshkin, a principal research scientist at Harvard\u2019s Department of Systems Biology who explained Petrova is assisting an investigation into the earliest stages of cell division using frog embryos.",
      "\u201cShe has made herself crucial to pretty much every project that\u2019s going on in the lab. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna continue without her,\u201d Peshkin said.",
      "Will Trim, a postdoctoral fellow and Petrova's roommate, backed the description of her scientific value. He has worked with her as she writes computer scripts to read images from a unique microscope that Trim believes has the potential to make breakthroughs in cancer detection.",
      "\u201cSome very important research will end if she\u2019s gone,\" Trim said.",
      "Trim boarded a flight to Louisiana on Friday to visit Petrova, who is allotted one visitor a week.",
      "The facility is one of nine immigration detention centers in the state, all located in the rural north or western parts of the state. Many detainees have complained of isolation as they are held long distances from their families and attorneys.",
      "Louisiana has been at the center of other high-profile immigration cases, including the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist.",
      "Like many others in detention, Petrova left her country to avoid conflict or possible political repression. She fled after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, marking the start of a bloody three-year war.",
      "\"If I go back, I am afraid I will be imprisoned because of my political position and my position against war,\u201d Petrova said.",
      "A Louisiana immigration judge earlier this week found the federal government\u2019s case to be legally insufficient and gave ICE a week to submit stronger evidence.",
      "Petrova's case is being closely watched by the scientific community, with some fearing it could impact recruiting and retaining foreign scientists at U.S. universities.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a wrong perception that foreign scientists are somehow privileged to be in the United States. I feel it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Peshkin said. \u201cForeign scientists come here with gifts ... they are highly skilled experts who are in demand. They enrich the American scientific community.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A new tribal national park in North Dakota is opening a little-seen area of the rugged Badlands to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A new tribal national park in North Dakota's rugged Badlands is opening a little-seen area of the dramatic landscape to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts, part of a Native American tribe's efforts to preserve the land and encourage recreation.",
      "The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation established Three Affiliated Tribes National Park with the purchase of 2,100 acres (850 hectares) of a former ranch adjacent to the Fort Berthold Reservation's boundaries on the south side of the Little Missouri River.",
      "The area was in the tribe's original treaty lands but a government allotment act later reduced the reservation's size, said Mary Fredericks, director of the tribe\u2019s Parks and Reserve Program. The reservation's boundaries have expanded to include the park.",
      "Tribal Chairman Mark Fox said the goal is to establish a park for cultural and recreational purposes such as canoeing, kayaking and viewing wildlife.",
      "\u201cIt's part of our history, our lands, very significant to us, the whole area,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThis is just another strong move to reacquire some of our lands and then do something very effective with it, so to speak\u201d to aid tourism and the economy through recreation.",
      "Park officials are being careful with how they plan and develop the park to be thoughtful about impacts on the landscape.",
      "\u201cThis place will be here in perpetuity and it will be better when we are done than it was when we got it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing for, that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed,\u201d Park Superintendent Ethan White Calfe said.",
      "North Dakota's Badlands \u2014 the name denotes the difficult terrain \u2014 comprise a stark, erosive, colorful landscape with dramatic shapes, petrified wood and ancient fossils. The area draws hikers, campers, hunters, bicyclists and other outdoors enthusiasts.",
      "The park, which held a soft opening in September, is open only to foot traffic by a free permit online. Park officials require visitors to register their plans and hikers must park at a grass lot. By the end of the summer, organizers hope to have 10 miles (16 kilometers) of trails finished, Fredericks said.",
      "Plans to build a visitor center and campground are in the works. Park officials also intend to work on native prairie and soil restoration in the erosive environment where some native plants that thrive in the area have been pushed out by invasive species, White Calfe said.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at it as how do we help this area look like it did 300 years ago? How do we help this area heal to where it is in a lot of more of a state of equilibrium,\u201d White Calfe said.",
      "It's a beautiful and picturesque but deceptive and steep landscape, Fredericks said.",
      "The park is bisected by a state highway that drops from a flat into a rugged river bottom. People can see parts of the park while driving, but not its interior, she said.",
      "Eventually, the park could be a gateway for visitors to the reservation, Fredericks said. Outdoor recreation is available at Lake Sakakawea, which straddles the vast reservation, and nearby at Theodore Roosevelt National Park and the Maah Daah Hey Trail.",
      "The MHA Nation benefits from oil development on its reservation, which helped the tribe to afford the land for the park, Fredericks said.",
      "\u201cBut in that we have to be careful and preserve and conserve,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm very, very proud of our tribal council for having the foresight to buy this land with the intent of making it into a national park ... because we don't know what's going to happen 50 years from now and what our landscape is going to look like, but we can preserve this part of it.\u201d",
      "The park neighbors Little Missouri State Park, which draws horseback riders to its 40 miles (64 kilometers) of trails in the Badlands.",
      "The rugged landscape \u201ckind of has that almost spiritual feel to it. It's peaceful,\u201d state Parks and Recreation Department Director Cody Schulz said.",
      "State park officials have worked with the tribe for about two years on its plans and partnering together, such as connecting trail systems, Schulz said. Tribal park officials are collaborating with anyone willing, Fredericks said.",
      "White Calfe said the park is an opportunity \u201cto tell our own story, our own narrative from our own perspective in a place like this. That's pretty valuable.\u201d",

      "Sixty years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led a rally protesting housing discrimination and segregated schools in Boston, thousands of people are expected to gather at the same site to honor and reflect on the historic event",
      "BOSTON -- As a Black teenager growing up in Boston, Wayne Lucas vividly remembers joining some 20,000 people to hear the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speak out against the city's segregated school system and the entrenched poverty in poor communities.",
      "Sixty years on, Lucas will be back on the Boston Common on Saturday to celebrate the anniversary of what became known as the 1965 Freedom Rally. This time, though, Lucas expects much of the focus will be on President Donald Trump and concerns that the commander-in-chief is exploiting divisions and fears about race and immigration.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s different forms of, how do we say it, racism and also I have to include fascism, what\u2019s going on in this country,\u201d said Lucas, a social activist and retired postal worker who was standing on the Boston Common near the site of 20-foot-high (6-meter) memorial to racial equity, \u201cThe Embrace,\u201d where the rally will be held.",
      "The rally will be preceded by a march mostly along the route taken to the Boston Common in 1965 and feature up to 125 different organizations.",
      "\u201cPeople gotta be aware and say something.\" he continued. \u201cWe can grumble (and) stuff like that, but we need to take part and do something.\"",
      "The original protest rally in 1965 brought the civil rights movement to the Northeast, a place King knew well from his time earning a doctorate in theology from Boston University and serving as assistant minister at the city\u2019s Twelfth Baptist Church. It was also the place he met his wife, Coretta Scott King, who earned a degree in music education from the New England Conservatory.",
      "In his speech, King told the crowd that he returned to Boston not to condemn the city but to encourage its leaders to do better at a time when Black leaders were fighting to desegregate the schools and housing and working to improve economic opportunities for Black residents. King also implored Boston to become a leader that other cities like New York and Chicago could follow in conducting \u201cthe creative experiments in the abolition of ghettos.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be demagogic and dishonest for me to say that Boston is a Birmingham, or to equate Massachusetts with Mississippi,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cBut it would be morally irresponsible were I to remain blind to the threat to liberty, the denial of opportunity, and the crippling poverty that we face in some sections of this community.\u201d",
      "The Boston rally happened after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and months ahead of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed in August.",
      "King and other civil rights movement leaders had just come off the Selma to Montgomery march in Alabama, also referred to as Blood Sunday, weeks before the Boston rally. The civil rights icon also was successful in the 1963 Birmingham campaign prompting the end of legalized racial segregation in the Alabama city, and eventually throughout the nation.",
      "This time in Boston, King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, will be the keynote speaker. He and other speakers are expected to touch on some of the same issues that have plagued communities of color for decades including the need for good jobs, decent health care and affordable housing.",
      "His visit also comes at a time when the Trump administration is waging war on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in government, schools and businesses around the country, including in Massachusetts.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges \u2014 public and private \u2014 that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.",
      "The Defense Department at one point temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. In February, Trump fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., a champion of racial diversity in the military, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown, in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing, had spoken publicly about his experiences as a Black man, and was only the second Black general to serve as chairman.",
      "The administration has fired diversity officers across government, curtailed some agencies\u2019 celebrations of Black History Month and terminated grants and contracts for projects ranging from planting trees in disadvantaged communities to studying achievement gaps in American schools. Trump also wants to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order targeting funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology.\"",
      "The efforts also impact Massachusetts. The state has pushed back against threats from the Trump administration to cut funding if the state doesn't comply with an Education Department order to certify local school systems' compliance with a race-neutral interpretation of civil rights laws.",
      "The Museum of African American History in Boston also announced earlier this month that a $500,000 federal grant received last year has been terminated.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, these efforts are designed to marginalize and destabilize the Museum of African American History, and African American public history institutions like us,\" the museum wrote in a statement. \u201cWe are all in danger of being erased.\u201d",
      "Martin Luther King III told The Associated Press that the attacks on diversity make little sense, noting, \u201cWe cannot move forward without understanding what happened in the past.\"",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s about blaming people. It\u2019s not about collective guilt. It\u2019s about collective responsibility,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow do we become better? Well, we appreciate everything that helped us to get to where we are. Diversity hasn't hurt the country.\u201d",
      "King said opponents of diversity have floated an uninformed narrative that unqualified people of color are taking jobs from white people, when the reality is they have long been denied opportunities they deserve.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if white people understand this, but Black people are tolerant,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom knee-high to a grasshopper, you have to be five times better than your white colleague. And that\u2019s how we prepare ourselves. So it\u2019s never a matter of unqualified, it\u2019s a matter of being excluded.\u201d",
      "Imari Paris Jeffries, the president and CEO of Embrace Boston, which along with the city is putting on the rally, said the event is a chance to remind people that elements of the \u201cpromissory note\u201d King referred to in his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech remain \"out of reach\u201d for many people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having a conversation about democracy. This is the promissory note \u2014 public education, public housing, public health, access to public art,\u201d Paris Jeffries said. \"All of these things are a part of democracy. Those are the things that are actually being threatened right now.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Coal-fired power plants, long a money-losing proposition in the U.S., are becoming more valuable now",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Coal-fired power plants, long an increasingly money-losing proposition in the U.S., are becoming more valuable now that the suddenly strong demand for electricity to run Big Tech's cloud computing and artificial intelligence applications has set off a full-on sprint to find new energy sources.",
      "President Donald Trump \u2014 who has pushed for U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market and suggested that coal can help meet surging power demand \u2014 is wielding his emergency authority to entice utilities to keep older coal-fired plants online and producing electricity.",
      "While some utilities were already delaying the retirement of coal-fired plants, the scores of coal-fired plants that have been shut down the past couple years \u2014 or will be shut down in the next couple years \u2014 are the object of growing interest from tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others competing for electricity.",
      "That\u2019s because they have a very attractive quality: high-voltage lines connecting to the electricity grid that they aren\u2019t using anymore and that a new power plant could use.",
      "That ready-to-go connection could enable a new generation of power plants \u2014 gas, nuclear, wind, solar or even battery storage \u2014 to help meet the demand for new power sources more quickly.",
      "For years, the bureaucratic nightmare around building new high-voltage power lines has ensnared efforts to get permits for such interconnections for new power plants, said John Jacobs, an energy policy analyst for the Washington, D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "\u201cThey are very interested in the potential here. Everyone sort of sees the writing on the wall for the need for transmission infrastructure, the need for clean firm power, the difficulty with siting projects and the value of reusing brownfield sites,\u201d Jacobs said.",
      "Coincidentally, the pace of retirements of the nation's aging coal-fired plants had been projected to accelerate at a time when electricity demand is rising for the first time in decades.",
      "The Department of Energy, in a December report, said its strategy for meeting that demand includes re-using coal plants, which have been unable to compete with a flood of cheap natural gas while being burdened with tougher pollution regulations aimed at its comparatively heavy emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "There are federal incentives, as well \u2014 such as tax credits and loan guarantees \u2014 that encourage the redevelopment of retired coal-fired plants into new energy sources.",
      "Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents independent power plant owners, said he expected Trump's executive orders will mean some coal-fired plants run longer than they would have \u2014 but that they are still destined for retirement.",
      "Time is of the essence in getting power plants online.",
      "Data center developers are reporting a yearlong wait in some areas to connect to the regional electricity grid. Rights-of-way approvals to build power lines can also be difficult to secure, given objections by neighbors who may not want to live near them.",
      "Stephen DeFrank, chairman of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, said he believes rising energy demand has made retiring coal-fired plants far more valuable.",
      "That's especially true now that the operator of the congested mid-Atlantic power grid has re-configured its plans to favor sites like retired coal-fired plants as a shortcut to meet demand, DeFrank said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to make these properties more valuable because now, as long as I\u2019m shovel ready, these power plants have that connection already established, I can go in and convert it to whatever,\" DeFrank said.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the vast majority of conversions is likely to be natural gas because Pennsylvania sits atop the prolific Marcellus Shale reservoir, DeFrank said.",
      "In states across the South, utilities are replacing retiring or retired coal units with gas. That includes a plant owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority; a Duke Energy project in North Carolina; and a Georgia Power plant.",
      "The high-voltage lines at retired coal plants on the Atlantic Coast in New Jersey and Massachusetts were used to connect offshore wind turbines to electricity grids.",
      "In Alabama, the site of a coal-fired plant, Plant Gorgas, shuttered in 2019, will become home to Alabama Power\u2019s first utility-scale battery energy storage plant.",
      "Texas-based Vistra, meanwhile, is in the process of installing solar panels and energy storage plants at a fleet of retired and still-operating coal-fired plants it owns in Illinois, thanks in part to state subsidies approved there in 2021.",
      "Nuclear is also getting a hard look.",
      "In Arizona, lawmakers are advancing legislation to make it easier for three utilities there \u2014 Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project and Tucson Electric Power \u2014 to put advanced nuclear reactors on the sites of retiring coal-fired plants.",
      "At the behest of Indiana's governor, Purdue University studied how the state could attract a new nuclear power industry. In its November report, it estimated that reusing a coal-fired plant site for a new nuclear power plant could reduce project costs by between 7% and 26%.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, in a 2023 study before electricity demand began spiking, estimated that nuclear plants could cut costs from 15% to 35% by building at a retiring coal plant site, compared to building at a new site.",
      "Even building next to the coal plant could cut costs by 10% by utilizing transmission assets, roads and buildings while avoiding some permitting hurdles, the center said.",
      "That interconnection was a major driver for Terrapower when it chose to start construction in Wyoming on a next-generation nuclear power plant next to PacifiCorp\u2019s coal-fired Naughton Power Plant.",
      "Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said the department analyzed how many sites might be suitable to advanced nuclear reactor plants.",
      "A compelling factor is the workers from coal plants who can be trained for work at a nuclear plant, Huff said. Those include electricians, welders and steam turbine maintenance technicians.",
      "In Homer City, the dread of losing its coal-fired plant \u2014 it shut down in 2023 after operating for 54 years \u2014 existed for years in the hills of western Pennsylvania\u2019s coal country.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough 20 years here for our area, maybe even longer than that, with the closing of the mines, and this was the final nail, with the closing of the power plant,\u201d said Rob Nymick, Homer City's manager. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh my god, what do we do?\u2019\u201d",
      "That is changing.",
      "The plant's owners in recent weeks demolished the smoke stacks and cooling towers at the Homer City Generating State and announced a $10 billion plan for a natural gas-powered data center campus.",
      "It would be the nation\u2019s third-largest power generator and that has sown some optimism locally.",
      "\u201cMaybe we will get some families moving in, it would help the school district with their enrollment, it would help us with our population,\u201d Nymick said. \u201cWe\u2019re a dying town and hopefully maybe we can get a restaurant or two to open up and start thriving again. We\u2019re hoping.\u201d",

      "Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is asking his party\u2019s candidate vying to be Virginia\u2019s next lieutenant governor to step aside",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Republican John Reid said Friday he will continue his campaign to be Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor and denied he had anything to do with a social media account containing sexually explicit photos that had prompted GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin to call for him to quit the race.",
      "Reid, the first openly gay man to run statewide in Virginia and a supporter of Youngkin, posted a video response to the governor's attempt to stymie his candidacy after the governor learned of the photos on a Tumblr account with a username matching the candidate\u2019s Instagram handle. Reid said the account was a fabrication that comes as he grapples with increasing pressure to exit the race by members of his party.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s predictable, but what I didn\u2019t expect was the governor I have always supported to call and demand my resignation without even showing me the supposed evidence or offering me a chance to respond,\u201d said Reid, a conservative talk-radio host. \u201cI did not accept that, and I deeply resent it.\u201d",
      "The political theater comes a week before the May 2 start of early voting in Virginia\u2019s primaries and only days after Reid's only Republican opponent dropped out.",
      "The Tumblr account, which was first reported by The Richmonder, was active Friday morning but was deleted by that afternoon. The webpage had reposted photos of naked men, according to The Richmonder.",
      "\u201cThe Governor was made aware late Thursday of the disturbing online content,\u201d according to a statement released by a political group affiliated with Youngkin. \u201cFriday morning, in a call with Mr. Reid, the Governor asked him to step down as the Lt. Governor nominee.\u201d",
      "In a video statement, Reid said he did not own the account. He also said his worst fear had been that someone would manufacture lies about him because of his sexuality.",
      "\u201cAnyone on the internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people,\u201d he said.",
      "Reid became the sole Republican candidate after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity left the race because of his health.",
      "Herrity's abrupt exit solidified Virginia Republicans' diverse ticket, with Reid running alongside Jamaican immigrant Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is vying to be governor, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, a first-generation Cuban American running for reelection.",
      "Before Youngkin's phone call, Reid said he was also pressed by a religious activist in Virginia to drop out after photos revealed him attending a drag show in Richmond. Since Herrity dropped out, Reid also said he received a deluge of requests insisting that he leave the race.",
      "Reid described the calls as \u201cdemands that I drop out, because supposedly, Christian voters would never support me, and it was inevitable that I would destroy the ticket and destroy Virginia,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI told everyone who called that I did not accept that analysis and would not decline the nomination that I\u2019ve worked for so many months to secure.\u201d",
      "Youngkin had initially backed Reid, writing on X on Monday: \u201cI spoke with John tonight and know he is ready to work with (Earle-Sears) and (Miyares) to keep Virginia the best state for business, to back the blue, and to stand strong for parents.\u201d",
      "The conservative Family Foundation Action group wrote in a Friday statement that they \u201cstrongly support Gov. Youngkin\u2019s call for John Reid to step aside as the Lieutenant Governor candidate. Virginians want elected officials who represent their values.\u201d",
      "Politicians and elected officials have received greater scrutiny for their online activity. The Tumblr account seemingly connected to Reid comes less than two years after Susanna Gibson, a Virginia Democrat, lost a House of Delegates race following reports that she had live-streamed sex acts with her husband on a pornographic website. Gibson has since said she and her husband did not consent to the live-stream being recorded, and argued the leak was criminal.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration is providing another example of how it's targeting those the president feels are blocking his agenda",
      "On Thursday, President Donald Trump directed his Department of Justice to investigate ActBlue, the Democratic Party-aligned fundraising site that has fueled so many successful challenges against his own party.",
      "The next day, amid a long-running feud with judges who have put some of his initiatives on hold because they may violate the Constitution, Trump's FBI arrested a Milwaukee judge, alleging she had helped a migrant evade immigration authorities.",
      "The two acts sent shockwaves through the legal and political worlds, which already have been reeling as Trump has used his office to target law firms, media outlets and individuals with whom he disagrees. The investigations are the latest version of a clear pattern in Trump's second term: The president has harnessed the power of the federal government to punish his enemies and anyone he sees as standing in his way.",
      "\u201cThis government has been consistent, from the moment it took office, in weaponizing the government and deploying it against critics,\u201d said Steve Levitsky, a Harvard political scientist and the coauthor of \u201cHow Democracies Die.\u201d \u201cThis is not a surprise. Trump campaigned on it and he's been doing it since day one.\u201d",
      "The complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday accused Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan of ushering the man, who is accused of being in the country illegally, out the \u201cjury door\u201d of her courtroom. The complaint alleges the judge became \u201cvisibly angry\u201d when told there were immigration agents in the courthouse.",
      "Her arrest Friday morning was announced in a post on X by Trump's FBI director, Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist who before the election had compiled an \u201cenemies list\u201d to target during the president's second term. Patel later deleted the post.",
      "Shortly after Dugan's arrest, a few dozen protesters marched outside the courthouse, chanting, \u201cJudge Dugan will be free, no justice, no peace.\u201d Democrats across the country were alarmed.",
      "\u201cThere are no kings in America,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. He called the arrest \u201ca dangerous escalation, an attack on the separation of powers, and we will fight this with everything we have.\u201d",
      "During an appearance on Fox News after the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a warning to judges across the country. She was addressing the case of Dugan and a retired New Mexico judge, whom the administration also is targeting for allegedly harboring someone in the country illegally. But her words carried extra weight given the administration's feuds with federal judges who have ruled against them in lawsuits challenging the administration's actions and executive orders.",
      "\"Some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law and they are not, and we\u2019re sending a very strong message today,\u201d Bondi said.",
      "Hours later, she revoked a Biden administration policy protecting journalists from having their records seized in leak investigations.",
      "Trump himself lambasted judges Friday as he flew to Pope Francis' funeral in Rome, frustrated that they were stalling his deportation plans.",
      "\u201cThese are judges who just want to show how big and important they are,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cThey shouldn't be allowed to do it. We have hundreds of thousands of people we want to get out of the country, and the courts are holding us back.\u201d",
      "The White House has mocked on social media an order, upheld unanimously at the U.S. Supreme Court, from a federal judge that it \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of a Maryland man it admitted mistakenly deporting to a notorious prison in El Salvador. It mocked another federal judge who ordered planes full of immigrants turned around before they reached El Salvador. In another case, it acknowledged deporting additional migrants despite an order against it, arguing that the judge only forbade immigration authorities \u2014 and not the military \u2014 from removing the men from the country.",
      "Trump's allies in Congress and online have urged that judges be impeached if they have ruled against his other initiatives to cut the federal government or unilaterally change elections, or even to ignore orders outright. With the Republican-controlled Congress silent as Trump tries to remake the federal government, the courts have emerged as the only branch of government that is actively challenging the president.",
      "Trump also moved to kneecap one other force challenging him by targeting ActBlue. The website funnels small-dollar donations to predominantly Democratic candidates and has become a powerhouse in helping Democrats stay ahead of Republicans financially in many elections. The GOP set up a site to mimic it called WinRed, but Trump's order only directs a probe into the Democratic site, not the one run by his own party.",
      "Trump asked Bondi to see if ActBlue was a potential conduit for illegal overseas donations. The site said it followed the law, and it and Democrats condemned the probe as politically motivated.",
      "Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, said Trump's targeting of Democratic Party infrastructure fits a pattern of many authoritarians around the world, who use government power to cripple opposition parties so they can no longer win elections.",
      "\u201cWe're well past Watergate,\u201d he said, referring to the 1972 scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation two years later. \u201cThe investigation of ActBlue makes clear that we're not in a fully democratic country.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn a democracy,\u201d Nyhan said, \u201copposition parties don't have to fight uphill.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday oversaw the signing by Congo and Rwanda of a pledge to work toward a peace deal that would ease U.S. access to critical minerals in resource-rich eastern Congo, bringing U.S. influence to bear in a minerals trade that has helped fuel conflict that has killed millions for three decades.",

      "Congo and Rwanda hope the involvement of the United States \u2014 and the incentive of major investment if there's enough security for U.S. companies to work safely in east Congo \u2014 will calm the fighting and militia violence that have defied peacekeeping and negotiation since the mid-1990s.",
      "The risk is that the United States becomes involved in or worsens the militia violence, corruption, exploitation and rights abuses surrounding the mining and trade of east Congo's riches.",
      "\u201cA durable peace ... will open the door for greater U.S. and broader Western investment, which will bring about economic opportunities and prosperity,\" Rubio said, adding that it would \u201cadvance President Trump's prosperity agenda for the world.\u201d",

      "Eastern Congo has been in and out of crisis for decades with more than 100 armed groups, most of which are vying for territory in the mining region near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian disasters with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who fled homes this year.",
      "Conflict in eastern Congo is estimated to have killed 6 million people since the mid-1990s, in the wake of the Rwanda genocide. Some of the ethnic Hutu extremists responsible for the 1994 killing of an estimated 1 million of Rwanda's minority ethnic Tutsis and Hutu moderates later fled across the border into eastern Congo, fueling the proxy fighting between rival militias aligned to the two governments.",
      "\u201cToday marks not an end but a beginning,\u201d Congolese Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner said Friday before signing the broad agreement, which commits Rwanda and Congo to draft a peace accord and work to instill security and a good business environment, allow the return of the millions of displaced and accomplish other goals.",
      "\u201cThe good news is there is hope for peace,\" she said. \"The real news is peace must be earned.\"",
      "She directed part of her remarks to the civilians of east Congo, brutalized, isolated and displaced by the fighting: \u201cWe know you are watching this moment with concern, with hope and, yes, with doubt. You are entitled to actions that measure up to the suffering you have endured.\u201d",
      "Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said the two rival governments were now addressing the root causes of the hostility between them, the most important of which he said were security and the ability of refugees to return home.",
      "\u201cVery importantly, we are discussing how to build new regional economic value chains that link our countries, including with American private sector investment,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s senior adviser for Africa, Massad Boulos, the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany, helped broker the U.S. role in promoting security in east Congo, part of an opening that Boulos has said could involve multibillion-dollar investments.",
      "The response from Congolese civil society Friday mixed hope with skepticism.",
      "Rights advocate Christophe Muisa in Goma, a city in east Congo that the powerful, Rwandan-backed M23 armed group seized earlier this year, said the U.S. is the main beneficiary of the deal. He urged his government not to \u201csubcontract its security.\u201d",
      "Georges Kapiamba, the president of the Congolese Association for the Access to Justice, a nongovernmental organization focusing on rights, justice and addressing corruption, said he supported a mineral-and-security deal with the U.S., but worried his own government could blow it by siphoning off the proceeds.",
      "Three months into Trump's second term, his administration and Republican lawmakers have made good on pledges to pare U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance down to agreements that most directly serve their perception of U.S. strategic and financial interests. The administration has terminated thousands of U.S. aid and development workers and programs that worked more broadly for global development.",
      "In another such transactional deal, the Trump administration is negotiating with Ukraine over a minerals deal that the U.S. is demanding as repayment for past U.S. military support after Russia invaded in 2022.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy initially proposed that deal last fall in hopes of strengthening his country\u2019s hand in its conflict with Russia by tying U.S. interests to Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "If the deal the U.S. is envisioning in east Congo goes well, it might end up stabilizing the region, said Gyude Moore, a former Cabinet minister in the West African nation of Liberia, now at the Center for Global Development, a think tank in Washington.",

      "SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Sarah Loving had just returned home from lunch last Saturday with her husband and two young children when she looked out the window and spotted two bears walking across her backyard in Simsbury, Connecticut.",
      "Her wildlife visitors didn't really surprise her. In recent years, bears have been pretty common in Simsbury, a suburban community of 24,500, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) northwest of Hartford, where overturned garbage cans are often found along the road on \u201ctrash day\u201d after a bear has searched inside for a snack.",
      "But when one of the bears stopped at her family's wooden playset and began climbing up the stairs, Loving started filming. What came next, took her by surprise.",
      "\u201cHe made it to the landing and then went down the slide, like he had done it before,\u201d she said. In the video, the bear nonchalantly slides head first, its front paws breaking its fall in a pile of soft sand at the bottom. The bear then lays there for a few seconds, calmly looking around.",
      "Loving said the pair hung out for a few more minutes before moving on to her neighbor's yard. Their appearance lasted about 10 minutes.",
      "\u201cThey seemed so comfortable on the playscape,\u201d said Loving, whose family moved to Simsbury about two years ago, not knowing they might run across bears. \u201cWe just kept joking that they probably have been before, but we have not seen a bear go down playscape before, ever. That was a first.\u201d",

      "California regulators have released a new proposal to allow the testing of self-driving heavy duty trucks on public roads",
      "LOS ANGELES -- California regulators have released a new proposal to allow the testing of self-driving heavy duty trucks on public roads.",
      "The state's Department of Motor Vehicles announced proposed regulations Friday to allow the testing of self-driving vehicles over 10,001 pounds, opening the door for companies to test self-driving technology with previously prohibited autonomous commercial semi-trucks on the road.",
      "Regulators say self-driving heavy-duty trucks are already being tested in other states including Texas, Arizona and Arkansas. California is the only state with regulations that explicitly ban them.",
      "The regulations are subject to a public comment period that ends in June.",
      "They will likely face pushback from the labor unions that represent the state's hundreds of thousands of commercial truck drivers, who are concerned about safety and losing truck driving jobs to automation in the future.",
      "The California Legislature passed a bill in 2023 to require human drivers aboard self-driving trucks, but it was vetoed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said additional regulation was unnecessarily because existing laws governing self-driving vehicles were sufficient.",
      "The proposed regulations will also enhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers, such as reporting instances when cars stop in the middle of an active road for any reason and need to be retrieved. They will give the state's Department of Motor Vehicles more authority to apply \u201cincremental enforcement measures\u201d against companies instead of fully suspending their testing permits.",

      "College journalists across the U.S. are navigating a surge in requests to remove previously published content amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on student protesters and what critics describe as unprecedented attacks on campus speech",
      "CHICAGO -- Over the past few weeks, Greta Reich, editor-in-chief of Stanford University\u2019s student newspaper, has had almost two dozen requests to take down quotes, bylines, photos and opinion articles from current and former sources and writers.",
      "She and her staff at the Stanford Daily have been reviewing them on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a number that has been startling to see,\u201d Reich said.",
      "Other student journalists on college campuses across the country are fielding similar requests. They are being asked to remove previously published content amid the Trump administration's crackdown on student protesters, fears of deportation for international students and what critics have described as unprecedented attacks on campus speech.",
      "Many young editors are beginning to reconsider long-standing journalistic practices around transparency to protect the people who appear in their reports. It's happening amid a climate of fear on campuses that is causing certain students to be reluctant to speak out publicly.",
      "These dramatic shifts in student media escalated after R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, was threatened with deportation and detained in March over what her lawyers say is apparent retaliation for an op-ed piece she co-wrote in the student newspaper. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was among four students who wrote the op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, criticizing the university\u2019s response to student activists demanding that Tufts \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\u201d disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.",
      "And Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist, was arrested in March and has been held in a Louisiana detention center for more than six weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 1,000 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review. The federal government has since announced it will reverse the termination of legal status for international students after many filed court challenges, a government lawyer said Friday.",
      "The need to consider high-stakes safety risks has increased pressure on students in newsrooms that are meant to be learning labs for future journalists.",
      "Emma Wozniak, editor-in-chief of The Lantern at Ohio State University, where 12 students had their visas revoked, said it's \u201ctaken a mental toll\u201d on staff members.",
      "\u201cWe feel an enormous pressure to do the right thing because the stakes are higher and we don\u2019t want to put anyone in danger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that something we put out into the world could have such a devastating impact on someone. And so we take that very seriously.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the Student Press Law Center and other media rights groups issued guidance urging student journalists to be more flexible about requests to take down content.",
      "\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve never, ever done before,\u201d said Mike Hiestand, senior legal counsel for the center. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented. But we felt it was important to respond to what we were hearing from students.\u201d",
      "Hiestand said he\u2019s seen a surge in calls from student journalists facing requests to take down content, remove bylines or offer anonymous sourcing. Some of the calls have been from international students concerned about how to protect themselves while working in campus newsrooms. Many, fearing legal repercussions, have decided to retract their names in the bylines of published articles or opinion pieces.",
      "\u201cPeople are really concerned, really fearful,\u201d he said.",
      "The Stanford Daily has seen multiple staff members step away from editing positions or from covering certain stories related to the Israel-Hamas war or President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Reich said.",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump, a Republican, has threatened funding for universities over what he calls \u201cwokeness\u201d and diversity efforts in education, and he has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.",
      "The Stanford Daily published a letter from the editor in April addressing a \u201cchilling effect we\u2019ve noticed on campus and the fear of speaking to the Daily\u201d and announcing more leniency in granting anonymity for students who feel threatened. Three days before, the Daily reported that six student visas had been revoked by federal authorities.",
      "Reich said she worries about the diversity in voices the Daily may be losing because international students especially are afraid to speak with reporters or join the newsroom.",
      "\u201cWhen we have an entire section of the student body scared to have their stories told, that\u2019s a significant portion of the life of Stanford that just isn\u2019t being told,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wildly concerning.\u201d",
      "Adam Kinder, editor-in-chief of the Columbia Political Review, said he\u2019s had about half a dozen requests from student writers wanting to put the publishing process on hold and a similar number of requests to take down previously published articles.",
      "Many of the requests have been from international students \u201cbecause of the very real fear right now, including the fear of deportation,\u201d Kinder said. The publication reversed a previous rule restricting non-bylined articles.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that we\u2019re getting more of these requests than we ever had before,\u201d he said.",
      "Dylan Hembrough, editor-in-chief of the Alestle at Southern Illinois University, said he\u2019s also being more flexible with taking down previously published content, removing bylines from staff writers and offering anonymity. That includes for an upcoming story about eight international students at the school who have had their visas revoked.",
      "The Alestle\u2019s staff is working on a new policy for removing previously published content.",
      "\u201cOffering anonymity now is important because for some of these people, their lives could be completely upended at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d Hembrough said. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are more important than a good story.\u201d",
      "Jane Kirtley, a University of Minnesota media ethics professor, acknowledged that the current moment \u201craises a whole new set of ethical issues that may feel much more existential.\u201d But she encouraged student journalists to slow down when deciding how to weigh minimizing harm with other ethical standards, including to seek the truth and report it and to tell the full story of what is happening.",
      "Kirtley said anonymous sourcing and non-bylined work can appear less credible. Removing previously published content can have lasting effects, given that journalism is often called the first draft of history.",
      "\u201cYou have to ask yourself, what am I doing to the historical record, especially amid attempts in the current administration to rewrite history,\u201d she said.",

      "Three of the defendants were charged earlier this month following their return to the United States from Congo, where the death sentences they faced were commuted prior to their repatriation.

      "The four Americans are charged with crimes including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to bomb government facilities and conspiracy to kill or kidnap persons in a foreign country. They face lengthy prison sentences if convicted.",
      "The three Americans who traveled to Congo were among 37 people sentenced to death last September by a military court in Congo for their role in the coup attempt.",
      "Moesser's attorney, Adam Merrill, declined comment. Attorneys for Malanga, Thompson and Zalman-Polun could not be reached immediately for comment by phone or email.",

      "A 38-year-old man was stabbed to death in the New York City subway during a rush-hour dispute with another rider who had stepped on the man\u2019s shoes",
      "NEW YORK -- A man was stabbed to death during the morning rush hour in the New York City subway system Friday after a dispute with another rider who had stepped on the man's shoes, police said.",
      "Police and medical personnel responded to the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station in lower Manhattan shortly after 8:30 a.m. for a 911 call about a person being stabbed. The victim, 38, was found unresponsive with multiple stab wounds to his torso and brought to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.",
      "Authorities said they were searching for the other rider, who they described as in his 20s or 30s who was dressed in black and wearing black headphones.",
      "Police said the two men got into an argument on a train after the other man stepped on the victim's shoes. The victim was stabbed on the train and in the subway station after the two got off, police said.",
      "Earlier this month, Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said there had been no murders in the transit system during the first three months of the year for the first time in seven years. She added that subway crime from January to March had decreased to the second-lowest level in the first quarter in 27 years.",
      "Violent crime is rare overall in the system, which carries millions of riders every day. However, recent high-profile attacks, such as a woman being set on fire and people being shoved onto the tracks, have left some riders on edge.",

      "The last of three friends accused of killing a driver in Colorado by throwing a rock through the windshield of her car has been convicted",
      "The last of three friends accused of killing a driver in Colorado by throwing a rock through the windshield of her car was convicted of first-degree murder Friday.",
      "The teens were driving around suburban Denver in 2023 throwing rocks at passing cars when one struck and killed 20-year-old Alexa Bartell in a crime prosecutors classified as murder.",
      "After two of the defendants had taken plea deals, the jury found the third, Joseph Koenig, guilty at the conclusion of a two-week trial during which jurors had to wade through the shifting and competing versions of the truth offered by the defendants. Sentencing is scheduled for June 3.",
      "Koenig, now 20, insisted that another person in the trio threw the rock that killed Bartell. But the two friends \u2014 whose agreements with prosecutors could lead to shorter prison sentences \u2014 said Koenig threw it.",
      "Chief Deputy District Attorney Katharine Decker told jurors the damage to Bartell\u2019s car was consistent with Koenig \u2014 who is left-handed and was driving \u2014 throwing the rock, shotput-style, out the driver\u2019s side window at Bartell\u2019s car as one of the friends, Nicholas Karol-Chik, testified. Even if jurors weren\u2019t convinced Koenig threw the rock, she had urged them to still find him guilty of first-degree murder as a conspirator with his friends, who both pleaded guilty to lesser charges.",
      "The defense didn't dispute that Koenig participated in the night of rock-throwing but said the third defendant, Zachary Kwak, threw the fatal rock. His attorneys argued Koenig did not know anyone had been hurt until Bartell's car went off the road, and that he had borderline personality disorder, which affected his impulse control and judgment.",
      "One of Koenig's lawyers, Martin Stuart, told jurors to instead find him guilty of manslaughter, the least serious charge he faced in Bartell's death, because he didn't knowingly try to kill her. Jurors also had the option of finding Koenig guilty of manslaughter as a conspirator, even if they didn't think he threw the rock himself.",
      "On April 19, 2023, after seeing Bartell\u2019s car leave the road after being hit, the three friends circled back a few times to look again, according to testimony and investigators. One of them, Kwak, took a photo as a memento but no one checked on the driver or called for help, according to their testimony.",
      "Bartell's body would not be discovered until her girlfriend, Jenna Griggs, who was on the phone with her that night when the call abruptly cut out, tracked her phone to the field, she testified. The only DNA found on the fatal rock was Bartell's, making the testimony from Kwak and Karol-Chik key to the prosecution.",
      "The friends agreed not to talk to anyone about what had happened. But Kwak, the newest one to the group, later told investigators that Koenig had thrown the fatal rock. Karol-Chik, who said Koenig was like a \u201cbrother\u201d to him, pointed the finger at Kwak before changing his story and saying that Koenig had thrown the rock that killed Bartell.",
      "Karol-Chik, who was sitting in the passenger seat of the pickup as Koenig drove, testified that Koenig seemed \u201cexcited\u201d as they drove by Bartell's car and at one point made a \u201cwhoop\u201d sound.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like him celebrating,\u201d said Karol-Chik, who admitted he had placed the fatal rock next to Koenig so he could grab it and throw it as he drove.",
      "Koenig's lawyers tried to cast doubt on the reliability of the other men's accounts.",
      "\u201cYou have no reason to believe me but I also have no reason to protect anyone anymore,\" Karol-Chik said on cross-examination.",
      "Karol-Chik and Kwak contradicted one another on a key point. Karol-Chik said they all threw about 10 rocks each that night. Kwak said he didn't throw any. The defense pointed out that Kwak did not say Koenig had thrown the rock until a detective told him someone had accused Kwak himself of doing it.",
      "But in their questioning of the friends, the defense also stressed that none of the three had intended to hurt anyone.",
      "Kwak entered into a plea deal first, pleading guilty in May 2024 to first-degree assault in Bartell\u2019s death, acknowledging that he acted in a way that created a grave risk of death. He also pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and attempted second-degree assault for the rocks that were thrown earlier in the night. He faces between 20 and 32 years in prison, prosecutors said.",
      "About a week later, Karol-Chik pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and committing a crime of violence. He also pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder for throwing rocks at a total of nine people that night and earlier in 2023.",
      "Under his plea agreement, Karol-Chik could be sent to prison for between 35 and 72 years in prison when he is sentenced.",

      "The federal government is reversing the termination of legal status for international students after many filed court challenges around the U.S., a government lawyer said Friday.",
      "Judges around the country had already issued temporary orders restoring the students' records in a federal database of international students maintained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. The records had been suddenly terminated in recent weeks, often without the students or their schools being notified.",
      "A lawyer for the government read a statement in federal court in Oakland that said ICE was manually restoring the student status for people whose records were terminated in recent weeks. A similar statement was read by a government attorney in a separate case in Washington on Friday, said lawyer Brian Green, who represents the plaintiff in that case. Green provided The Associated Press with a copy of the statement that the government lawyer emailed to him.",
      "It says: \u201cICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. Until such a policy is issued, the SEVIS records for plaintiff(s) in this case (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated if not currently active and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.\"",
      "Green said that the government lawyer said it would apply to all students in the same situation, not just those who had filed lawsuits.",
      "SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students' compliance with their visa status. NCIC is the National Crime Information Center, which is maintained by the FBI. Many of the students whose records were terminated were told that their status was terminated as a result of a criminal records check or that their visa had been revoked.",
      "International students and their schools were caught off guard by the terminations of the students' records. Many of the terminations were discovered when school officials were doing routine checks of the international student database or when they checked specifically after hearing about other terminations.",

      "The National Weather Service discouraged any outdoor burning with low humidity, temperatures reaching near 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) and southerly winds that could gust up to 20 mph (32 kph) across a swath of the Mid-Atlantic. There's a chance of rain over the weekend in the region.",
      "In its most recent update, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said about half of the fire spread over nearly 24 square miles (62 square kilometers) in the southern part of the state was contained. No injuries or deaths have been reported, but buildings have burned along with cars. Officials have charged a 19-year-old man from the area with starting the blaze that led to the wildfire.",

      "Authorities first spotted the blaze Tuesday morning from a fire tower when a smoke column appeared amid the pines. Law enforcement said they used a GPS to plot the origin of the fire and determined the cause was a bonfire that hadn\u2019t been put out.",
      "Speaking Thursday afternoon at a news conference, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D.

      "Though parts of the Pine Barrens are uninhabited, New Jersey is the nation\u2019s most densely populated state and officials have warned the fire could threaten developments nearby. The fire had grown to more than 23.8 square miles (about 62 square kilometers) on Thursday.",
      "Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in recent years in New Jersey, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).",
      "Jim and Lenore Thoms, who own a business in an industrial park near the blaze, called the fire \u201ca very scary experience\u201d and praised the efforts of firefighters.",
      "\u201cThe firefighters were phenomenal, they saved this whole park,\u201d Jim Thoms said. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t around, the way things were going on, you might not have seen any buildings at all.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, New York officials warned of higher-than-normal pollution levels were possible in New York City, Rockland and Westchester counties, and in Long Island\u2019s Nassau and Suffolk counties.",
      "The fire is roughly 54 miles (87 kilometers) south of New York City. It's about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Philadelphia.",

      "American citizens, visa holders and visitors stopped at airports, detained for days or facing deportation for minor infractions.",
      "Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him. But unlike in his first term, Trump\u2019s efforts have not sparked the kind of widespread condemnation or protests that led him to retreat from some unpopular positions.",
      "Instead, immigration has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s strongest issues in public polling, reflecting both his grip on the Republican base and a broader shift in public sentiment that is driven in part, interviews suggest, by anger at the policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "The White House has seized on this shift, mocking critics and egging on Democrats to engage on an issue that Trump's team sees as a win.",
      "\u201cAmerica\u2019s changed,\u201d said pollster Frank Luntz, a longtime ally of Republicans who has been holding focus groups with voters to discuss immigration. \u201cThis is the one area where Donald Trump still has significant and widespread public support.\u201d",
      "Luntz said voters dismayed by the historically large influx of migrants under Biden are now \u201cprepared to accept a more extreme approach.\"",
      "\u201cMake no mistake,\" he added. \u201cThe public may not embrace it, but they definitely support it. And this is actually his strongest area as he approaches his 100th day (in office).\u201d",
      "A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that immigration is a relative high point for Trump compared with other issues, including his approach to the economy, foreign policy and trade negotiations. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults, 46%, say they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the issue, compared with his overall job approval rating of 39%, according to the survey.",
      "The poll was conducted April 17-21, a period that included a trip by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., to El Salvador to demand that Kilmar Abrego Garcia be released from prison after the U.S. government admitted he was wrongly deported.",
      "In the 2020 election, few voters considered immigration the most important issue facing the country, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of registered voters in all 50 states.",
      "Four years later, after Republicans and conservative media had hammered Biden for his policies and often cast migrant U.S.-Mexico border crossings as an invasion, immigration had risen above health care, abortion and crime. It was second only to the economy.",
      "Under Biden, migrant apprehensions spiked to more than 2 million two years in a row. Republican governors in border states bused migrants by the tens of thousands to cities across the country, including to New York, where migrants were placed in shelters and hotels, straining budgets.",
      "Voters in the 2024 election were also more open to tougher immigration policies than the 2020 electorate. Last November, 44% of voters said most immigrants living in the United States illegally should be deported to their home countries, according to AP VoteCast, compared with 29% in 2020.",
      "Immigration remains a relative strength for Trump today: 84% of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s immigration approach, according to the April AP-NORC poll, compared with 68% who approve of how he is handling trade negotiations.",
      "The poll found about 4 in 10 U.S. adults \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favor Trump\u2019s policy of sending Venezuelan immigrants who authorities say are gang members to El Salvador, with an additional 22% saying they neither favor nor oppose it. About 4 in 10 were opposed.",
      "Americans are more opposed, broadly, to revoking foreign students\u2019 visas over their participation in pro-Palestinian activism, with about half opposed and about 3 in 10 in support.",
      "The changing views are evident in places like northern New Jersey\u2019s suburban Passaic County, one of the former Democratic strongholds where Trump overperformed in November.",
      "Trump became the first Republican to win the county in more than 30 years. He carried the heavily Latino city of Passaic and significantly increased his support in Paterson, the state\u2019s third-largest city, which is majority Latino and also has a large Muslim community. He drew 13,819 votes after winning 3,999 in 2016. Having lost New Jersey by nearly 16 percentage points to Biden in 2020, Trump narrowed that margin to 6 percentage points last year.",
      "Paterson resident Sunny Cumur, 54, a truck driver who immigrated from Turkey in the late 1990s, describes himself as a Democrat who doesn\u2019t usually vote. But he wanted Trump to win, he said, because he was concerned about the border under Biden.",
      "While studies show immigrants are generally less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, local news in New York and other cities frequently featured what Trump took to calling \u201cmigrant crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat Biden did, they opened all the borders, and a lot of people come here for political asylum. Come on! They don't even check if they are terrorists or not,\" Cumur said. He complained that newcomers willing to work for lower wages have been undercutting workers like him.",
      "\u201cThrow \u2019em out. I don\u2019t want to live with criminals,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, other supporters worry Trump is taking things too far.",
      "Republican Manuel Terrero, 39, a real estate agent from Clifton, said he was drawn to Trump because of what felt like \u201cchaos\u201d under Biden, with too many people crossing the border and too much crime in neighboring New York.",
      "\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be allowed,\u201d said Terrero, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic.",
      "Trump \u201cis doing a lot of good things. And that is one of them, stopping the people that are coming here to create chaos. And the people that have criminal records, send them back. But I am against (deporting) the people that are working,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to do it.\"",
      "Rep. Nellie Pou, D-N.J., who was elected last year to represent the area in Congress, said her constituents believe strongly in border security but stand by her advocacy for immigrants. She recently joined Democrats on a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\u201cI do not want anyone that may be a danger to come to our country to harm any of our citizens. No one wants that. And I firmly believe that\u2019s what people in our district and across America want,\u201d she said. At the same time, she said, \u201cOur country was made of immigrants. ... So I believe there\u2019s a place for someone who comes in the legal ways.\u201d",
      "Trump burst onto the political scene in 2015 by labeling Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists and pledging to build \u201ca great wall.\u201d He spent much of his first term focused on the border.",
      "One of his first actions in office was to impose a travel ban barring the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. That caused chaos at airports and protests across the nation. The policy was quickly blocked by the courts, forcing his administration to offer three broader iterations, the last of which was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The next flashpoint came in 2018, when border officials began separating families detained after illegally crossing the border. In some cases, children were forcibly removed from their parents under a \"zero tolerance\u201d policy, and the parents were sometimes deported without their kids.",
      "Images of children held in cages at border facilities and audio recordings of young children crying for their parents drew intense backlash, with thousands participating in hundreds of marches across the country. The protesters included soon-to-be Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was photographed in 2018 breaking down outside a facility in Texas being used to detain migrant children.",
      "Republicans joined in that condemnation.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, called the separations \u201ctragic and heartrending\" in a letter that urged Congress to act. \u201cThis disgraceful condition must end,\" he wrote.",
      "\u201cAll Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers. This must stop,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. He introduced legislation mandating that apprehended families be kept together.",
      "Bowing to pressure and concerned about the impact on the upcoming midterm elections, Trump halted the policy.",
      "This time around, with border crossings down, Trump has shifted focus to expelling people already in the United States. He is expanding the limits of executive power and jousting with judges as he uses old laws and rarely used provisions to label hundreds of men gang members so they can be deported without being able to challenge their cases in court.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 who as a senator once tried to negotiate a bipartisan immigration package \u2014 has moved to expel people in the U.S. legally over political beliefs he deems counter to U.S. foreign policy interests.",
      "Their targets have included hundreds of students and others with legal status, including those on student visas or holding green cards conferring permanent residency, as well as those who have sought asylum using legal channels.",
      "Jorge Loweree, of the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group, said Trump was doing something \u201cthat\u2019s wholly new in historical terms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical that people understand what the administration is doing,\u201d said Loweree, the council's managing director of programs and strategy. \u201cWe have an administration that believes they can disappear who they want, where they want, to anywhere they want.\u201d",
      "Loweree argued that even if voters in November rejected what they saw as chaos at the border, that \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they support these very draconian measures that are being implemented today.\u201d",
      "Few elected Republicans are speaking out, though some of Trump\u2019s outside allies have criticized what they see as overreach.",
      "Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host who endorsed Trump late in the campaign, voiced alarm at the case of Andry Hernandez Romero, a gay makeup artist from Venezuela with no criminal record who was among those sent to El Salvador's maximum-security CECOT prison.",
      "\u201cYou gotta get scared that people who are not criminals are getting like lassoed up and deported and sent to like El Salvador prisons,\u201d Rogan told his listeners. \u201cThat\u2019s horrific. And again, that\u2019s bad for the cause. Like the cause is let\u2019s get the gang members out. Everybody agrees. But let\u2019s not (have) innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs.\u201d",
      "The April AP-NORC poll found that about half of Americans say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, compared with about 6 in 10 who say he\u2019s \u201cgone too far\u201d on imposing new tariffs on other countries.",
      "It found Americans split on mass deportations, with about 4 in 10 in favor of deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and a similar share opposed. The percentage who support mass deportations is down slightly from an AP-NORC poll conducted in January, just before Trump took office.",
      "Still, about one-third of U.S. adults say Trump\u2019s actions have been \u201cabout right\u201d on immigration, and about 2 in 10 think he hasn't gone far enough.",
      "One case that has gained traction nationally is that of Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident from El Salvador who was sent to CECOT despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation. Trump officials have said that Abrego Garcia has ties to the MS-13 gang, a claim Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny, and noted that his wife once sought a protective order against him.",
      "El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has said he will not let Abrego Garcia leave the country.",
      "More Democrats have traveled to El Salvador to highlight the case. And people angry about the situation have confronted Republican lawmakers, including at a contentious town hall Wednesday hosted by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, during which several members of the audience shouted at him to push for Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "The White House has embraced the fight. \u201cA request for Democrats \u2014 please continue to make defending criminal illegal immigrants your top messaging point,\u201d wrote Trump\u2019s director of communications, Steven Cheung.",
      "Some in the party have urged it to steer clear. Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., called the case a \u201cdistraction\u201d from issues such as tariffs that have emerged as a bigger weakness for Trump.",
      "\u201cThis is the debate (Republicans) want. This is their 80-20 issue, as they\u2019ve described it,\u201d he said of Republicans on his podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough case, because,\u201d he said, it risks people wondering, \u201care they defending MS-13?\u201d",
      "But Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, is urging Democrats to seize on the case. He says border issues are \u201cmuch more nuanced than \u2018immigration good for Trump, bad for Democrats'\" and believes that voters are on their side.",
      "\u201cIf we can't stand up against the illegal rendition of the father of a U.S. child to a prison known for torture, then I don\u2019t really know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.",

      "MIAMI -- As hundreds of migrants crowded into the Krome Detention Center in Miami on the edge of the Florida Everglades, a palpable fear of an uprising set in among its staff.",
      "As President Donald Trump sought to make good on his campaign pledge of mass arrests and removals of migrants, Krome, the United States' oldest immigration detention facility and one with a long history of abuse, saw its prisoner population recently swell to nearly three times its capacity of 600.",
      "\u201cThere are 1700 people here at Krome!!!!,\u201d one U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee texted a co-worker last month, adding that even though it felt unsafe to walk around the facility nobody was willing to speak out.",
      "That tension comes amid a battle in federal courts over whether the president\u2019s immigration crackdown has gone too far, too fast at the expense of fundamental rights.",
      "At Krome, reports have poured in about a lack of water and food, unsanitary confinement and medical neglect. With the surge of complaints, the Trump administration shut down three Department of Homeland Security oversight offices charged with investigating such claims.",
      "A copy of the text exchange was shared with The Associated Press by a federal employee on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Other documents include detainee complaints as well as an account of the arrival of 40 women at Krome, an all-male facility, in possible violation of a federal law to reduce the risk of prison rape.",
      "Nationwide, detentions have surged to nearly 48,000 as of March 23, a 21% increase from the already elevated levels at the end of the Biden administration.",
      "To address the shortage of capacity, ICE this month published a request for bids to operate detention centers for up to $45 billion as it seeks to expand to 100,000 beds from its current budget for about 41,000. As part of the build-out, the federal government, for the first time, is looking to hold migrants on U.S. Army bases.",
      "By some measures, Trump's controversial approach is working. Barely 11,000 migrants were encountered at the U.S.-Mexican border in March, their lowest level in at least a decade and down from 96,035 in December 2024, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "Krome is just one of five facilities that ICE directly runs and can house detainees for more than 16 hours. The vast majority of bed space is leased from local prisons, jails or privately-run facilities that have strict limits on how many detainees they are contractually obligated to accept.",
      "As its concrete cellblocks began filling up, federal workers started documenting the worsening conditions in weekly reports for DHS leadership. They worked their way up the chain through DHS\u2019 Office of Immigration & Detention Ombudsman, an independent watchdog established by Congress during the first Trump administration.",
      "In mid-March, the office\u2019s 100 staffers \u2014 including a case manager at Krome \u2014 were placed on administrative leave.",
      "\u201cRather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations,\u201d DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said at the time.",
      "Around the same time, Krome\u2019s chaos spilled into public view. Images secretly shot on a cellphone and posted on TikTok showed a group of men sleeping on concrete floors and under tables with little more than their shoes as pillows.",
      "\u201cWe are practically kidnapped,\u201d Osiris Vazquez, his eyes bloodshot due to a lack of sleep, said in the grainy video, which garnered 4.4 million views. \u201cWe don\u2019t want likes. We want help. Please!\u201d",
      "Vazquez said he shared a small room for two weeks with some 80 men. Showers and phone calls weren\u2019t allowed, the fetid-smelling bathrooms were left unattended and food was restricted to peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "\u201cYou lost all notion of time, whether it\u2019s day or night,\" recalled Vazquez in an interview after self-deporting to his native Mexico.",
      "It could\u2019ve been worse. Since Trump returned to the White House, three detainees have died in ICE custody \u2014 two of them at Krome.",
      "The latest, Maksym Chernyak, died after complaining to his wife about overcrowding and freezing conditions. The 44-year-old Ukrainian entered the U.S. last year under a humanitarian program for people fleeing the country\u2019s war with Russia.",
      "He was sent to Krome after an arrest for domestic violence and got sick with a chest cold. After being monitored for a week with high blood pressure, on Feb. 18, at 2:33 a.m., he was taken to a hospital for seizure-like vomiting. Two days later, he died.",
      "Other than acetaminophen, he received no medication to treat his blood pressure, according to a two-page ICE report about Chernyak\u2019s death. Chernyak\u2019s widow said that before her husband\u2019s detention, he was a \u201cstrong, healthy man.\u201d Without a translator, she said, her husband struggled to communicate.",
      "\u201cThey saw his condition, but they ignored him,\u201d said Oksana Tarasiuk in an interview. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t put in Krome, I\u2019m sure that he would still be alive.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration plans to strictly require anyone illegally in the U.S. to register with the government and carry documentation",
      "PHOENIX -- The Trump administration's plan to strictly require anyone illegally in the U.S. to register with the government and carry documentation is stirring up fears of heightened racial profiling even among legal residents, immigrants' rights advocates say.",
      "For some, it's a return to a climate from the recent past in which police departments and other law enforcement agencies' insistence on documentation drove immigrants underground and increased public safety concerns.",
      "\u201cIt happens already to an extent. ... I think this would make it even worse because how would you know somebody is undocumented?\u201d said Jose Pati\u00f1o, vice president of education and external affairs for Aliento, an Arizona-based advocacy organization that supports immigrants without documents. \u201cIt creates ambiguity of how you\u2019re going to enforce and identify people who are not in the country (legally).\"",
      "A federal judge sided with President Donald Trump earlier this month in a lawsuit brought by immigrants' rights groups over the policy and the mandate took effect April 11. Trump officials say they are simply enforcing a requirement that has been law for decades.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws \u2014 we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,\" U.S. Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said in the statement after the ruling. \"We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.\u201d",
      "Under federal law, everyone 14 and older without legal status must self-register and give fingerprints and an address. Parents and guardians of anyone younger must ensure they are registered. Not doing so is considered a crime and a lack of documents risks prison time and fines.",
      "The mandate has rarely been enforced under previous administrations. To complicate matters, there have been recent instances of authorities detaining even people born in the U.S. as confusion also sweeps through other federal and state immigration policies.",
      "An online appointment app used by temporary residents has sent work permit cancellations since late March, including to U.S. citizens. A growing number of Republican-led states also are refusing to recognize state driver\u2019s licenses specially issued for immigrants without documents.",
      "Guerline Jozef, executive director of the nonprofit Haitian Bridge Alliance, says racial profiling already happens at a disproportionate rate to Black migrants. The sudden pivot has aggravated things and people with Temporary Protected Status or who had regular Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins have been detained during travel, she said.",
      "She decried the whole ordeal as a form of \u201cpsychological warfare.\" Migrants who were allowed temporary legal residence are not sure if they need to protectively carry documents at all times.",
      "\u201cIt is very hard to even communicate with the community members on what to do, telling them they need to know their rights, but they trample on their rights anyway,\u201d Jozef said. \u201cWe are back in the \u2018show me your papers\u2019 era.\u201d",
      "The new mandate evokes previous instances of certain groups having to carry documentation.

During World War II, Japanese Americans were required to register and keep identification cards but were put in incarceration camps.",
      "\u201cThe statutes that are on the books about registration have been dormant\" for 85 years, said Lynn Marcus, director of immigration law clinics at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law. \u201cThere weren't forms to comply with this requirement. It was created in wartime originally.\u201d",

      "Eileen Diaz McConnell, a professor at Arizona State University's School of Transborder Studies, pointed to the effects of a 2010 Arizona law requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers.",
      "In 2012, the Justice Department sued the state over the law and the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the papers requirement, but those two years when the requirement was in place were a traumatic time for Latino families in the state, McConnell said.",
      "\u201cParents wouldn\u2019t ride together in a car. They were always separated because they were worried they would be stopped,\u201d Diaz McConnell said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t leave their house.\u201d",
      "She has done extensive research on how immigration policies can impact the mental health of mixed households of family members who are American-born and don't have documents.",
      "\u201cIn previous years, children report, even if they\u2019re U.S.-born, real harm \u2014 impacts on their own sleep, worry, not eating, depression,\u201d Diaz McConnell said. \u201cThere will be people who will say things like, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re not undocumented, what do you have to worry about?\u2019\"",
      "Pati\u00f1o, whose undocumented parents brought him to the U.S. when he was 6, is accustomed to keeping papers as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient.

      "People who crossed the border without documents are especially unsure whether to register in the wake of international students and others being detained or deported even though they had visas or pending court hearings.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking people to come out of the shadows and enroll us in a system that most of them probably have not heard of,\u201d Pati\u00f1o said. \u201cIt seems the administration is trying to go catch-22 with folks.

    "story": [
      "\"I never wanted to do anything else but be a hairdresser,\" said Kerry Larcher, who opened her first salon when she was 21-years-old.",
      "Despite successfully growing her business in Hornchurch, in East London, over three decades, the 50-year-old says she now faces losing her life's work and her home.",
      "Tax rises in October's Budget are \"crippling\" her salon business, she said, and the extra \u00a323,000 a year imposed by the chancellor could prove the final nail in the coffin.",
      "\"I have been crying myself to sleep because, since October, this has been the worst period of my personal life in 30 years,\" she said.",
      "\"I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can't take wages if I don't make a profit.",
      "\"I could lose my house if the business folds - that is the reality and if things don't change it is frightening the life out of me.\"",
      "'I don't have the margin to invest in apprentices'",
      "'Perfect storm' could see end of salon apprenticeships",
      "'We're always hammered' - Beauty industry ahead of budget",
      "The government says the tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves were needed to stabilise the economy.",
      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from about \u00a37,000 to about \u00a318,000 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:07:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The US central bank is one of Trump's favourite punching bags. But how serious is the threat?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank.",
      "Elevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.",
      "But however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse.",
      "Not only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Coming at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.",
      "The tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.",
      "It came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.",
      "But Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.",
      "Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy.",
      "\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"",
      "What is Trump's problem with Powell?",
      "Trump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.",
      "Lower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.",
      "Trump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.",
      "He objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.",
      "\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.",
      "A threat to Fed independence?",
      "Trump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.",
      "Nor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.",
      "Trump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.",
      "It has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.",
      "The idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.",
      "Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled.",
      "If shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.",
      "\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.",
      "Can Trump fire Powell?",
      "Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.",
      "\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy.",
      "He said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed.",
      "\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"",
      "Powell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him.",
      "But the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate.",
      "By law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.",
      "The administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure.",
      "Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.",
      "\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.",
      "Asked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\""

      "The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "It comes after a series of household bills became more expensive in April, and would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,683.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "Huge uncertainty",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at \u00a31,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April.",
      "The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September.",
      "Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts.",
      "\"While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. We have all seen markets go up as fast as they go down, and the very fact the market dropped so quickly shows how vulnerable it is to geopolitical and market shifts,\" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, which is widely recognised for the accuracy of its predictions.",
      "\"There is unfortunately no guarantee that any fall in prices will be sustained.",
      "\"The only real way to protect households from this constant cycle of instability and insecurity is to reduce our dependence on international wholesale markets.\"",
      "The fall in the wholesale cost of energy, paid by suppliers, is behind the latest predictions.",
      "That has been affected by US tariffs policy and warmer-than-expected weather in Europe."

      "South America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.",
      "The US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.",
      "For example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.",
      "There is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.",
      "With the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.",
      "These include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.",
      "He tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".",
      "However, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.",
      "So his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.",
      "\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Yet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.",
      "Take the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.",
      "Japan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.",
      "Other Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.",
      "Brazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.",
      "Trump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.",
      "This would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.",
      "Meanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place.",
      "The other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.",

      "You may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.",
      "Whether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.",
      "Firstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.",
      "The US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.",
      "Brazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.",
      "Argentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.",
      "\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.",
      "Trump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.",
      "Eduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.",
      "Looking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.",
      "After all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.",
      "Mr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"",
      "He theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.",
      "So, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.",
      "As Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"",
      "Subject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.",
      "But adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Post Office has paid more than \u00a3600m of public money to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system despite deciding to ditch it more than a decade ago, the BBC can reveal.",
      "The terms of the original 1999 deal with computer giant Fujitsu mean the Post Office has been stuck with the system and unable to build a replacement so far, even after it contributed to one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.",
      "Former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and other senior Labour government figures were warned about potential problems with the terms of the deal before it was signed, the BBC has learned.",
      "The Post Office said it \"apologises unreservedly to victims of the Horizon IT scandal\" and said it was committed to moving away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software.",
      "Under the terms of the original \u00a3548m deal, struck under pressure from the then-Labour government, the Post Office did not own the computer code for the core part of the Horizon system.",
      "Although the Post Office has wanted to switch suppliers since 2012, buying the rights to the code from Fujitsu or building a completely new system from scratch was considered too expensive - even as the amounts paid to Fujitsu to retain the Horizon system grew and grew.",
      "Because it did not own the code, the Post Office was also unable to inspect the part of the software that processed transactions, and had to rely on assurances from Fujitsu that it was functioning correctly.",
      "The Post Office, which is owned by the government, prosecuted about 700 sub-postmasters between 1999 and 2015 for theft, fraud and false accounting over supposed cash shortfalls in branches reported by the Horizon system, based on these assurances. The convictions were overturned by Parliament last year.",
      "Earlier this year, Business Minister Baroness Jones of Whitchurch told the House of Lords that the Post Office is \"unfortunately, still dependent on the Horizon system\", and the only way Fujitsu could be \"out of the picture\" immediately would mean shutting down all local post offices.",
      "An attempt to replace the system with one built by IBM failed in 2016, at a cost of \u00a340m, and the Post Office extended its contract with Fujitsu for at least four more years at a cost of \u00a3107m.",
      "The Post Office told the BBC that it finally obtained rights related to the Horizon software and code in 2023, although it is not known if this includes the core system that processes transactions.",
      "The \u00a310m price for the licence was \"cheap - because who else would buy it?\" according to IT expert Jason Coyne, one of the first people to identify flaws in the system.",
      "The BBC understands that the Post Office may try to use this licence for Horizon's replacement. But while this is being built,  IT experts believe the Post Office's contract with Fujitsu will need to be extended beyond March 2026 - when it is currently due to end.",
      "Issues over who would own the Horizon software began when the contract to computerise the network of Post Office branches - then numbering 18,000 - was negotiated between the Post Office, Fujitsu and its subsidiary ICL Pathway, and the government.",
      "In May 1999, Sir Tony Blair received an update from the Treasury, in a document warning that discussions with ICL over the terms of a deal \"have foundered\".",
      "One of the sticking points was around intellectual property rights (IPR) - which included ownership of the code within the Horizon software.",
      "The document says that ICL was \"not prepared to... give perpetual licences for all the IPR\".",
      "It goes on to say that if the Post Office ever wanted to change suppliers, the owner of the IPR \"would be in a strong position to drive a costly settlement with the Post Office\".",
      "The BBC has also obtained a document from 20 May the same year, which was sent to then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and other government officials, warning about the issue of who owned the code.",
      "In it, a Treasury civil servant states that one of the \"main problems\" with the terms of a proposed deal with ICL for the Horizon software was the \"issues surrounding ownership of assets and IPR of the kit acquired by\" the Post Office.",
      "Mr Coyne, the IT expert, said it was \"utter madness\" that the deal went ahead in July 1999 because it meant that the Post Office became \"operationally reliant on Horizon\", even though it did not own the rights to use the system without Fujitsu.",
      "A spokesperson for Sir Tony Blair did not address the BBC's questions around his knowledge of the IPR issues but said he \"took very seriously the issues raised about the Horizon contract\" at the time.",
      "\"The final decision was taken after an investigation by an independent panel recommended it was viable.",
      "\"It is now clear that the Horizon product was seriously flawed, leading to tragic and completely unacceptable consequences, and Mr Blair has deep sympathy with all those affected.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Gordon Brown said he \"would not have been shown the memo\" from 20 May 1999 and he would have been copied in as a \"formality\".",
      "\"He was not involved in any work related to the purchasing, award or management of the Horizon contract.\"",
      "The warnings about ownership of the IPR came true more than a decade later when Post Office decided to invite other companies to take over the Horizon contract.",
      "Former executives told the Post Office Inquiry, which is examining decisions leading up to the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters, how the company had found it difficult to replace Fujitsu.",
      "Alisdair Cameron, former chief financial officer at the Post Office, said that Fujitsu had been \"difficult colleagues\" and \"it was accepted that Horizon, and the infrastructure on which it was built, was vulnerable\".",
      "But Mike Young, chief operations officer at the Post Office between October 2010 and April 2012, told the inquiry that Fujitsu management said to him \"the code is ours. You own the service because you pay for that but you don't pay [for] the code\".",
      "Documents released by the Post Office Inquiry show the \"IPR issue\" was often discussed by top-level Post Office executives.",
      "\"There is a risk that we may be unable to agree an IP license with Fujitsu on reasonable terms\", said an agenda for a Post Office board meeting in July 2013 - while other documents describe concerns over costs.",
      "Procurement specialist Ian Makgill told us he believes not owning the IPR to the Horizon software would have been a factor in the collapse of the 2016 IBM deal to replace the system.",
      "He said that if IBM had tried to build new software without any of the IPR from Horizon, it would have needed to \"start from scratch, which would have cost the Post Office hundreds of millions of pounds\".",
      "\"IPR is the reason why the Post Office hasn't been able to move away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software,\" he said.",
      "Since 1999, the Post Office has spent \u00a32.5bn on contracts with Fujitsu. This figure includes more than \u00a3600m spent on bridging or extension contracts to continue the Horizon contract since the Post Office started looking for new suppliers in 2012, according to analysis from data firm Tussell and the BBC.",
      "Many of the sub-postmasters wrongly accused by the Post Office maintained that there was no missing money and the shortfalls were down to errors in the Horizon system.",
      "But with the Post Office unable to directly inspect the system which processed transactions, it accepted assurances from Fujitsu that the system was working correctly.",
      "\"Fujitsu were fighting the whole time to protect their investment and their intellectual property, rather than looking after the interests of the sub-postmasters,\" said Mr Makgill.",
      "Fujitsu did not respond to the BBC's specific questions but stated that it was \"focused on supporting the Post Office in their plans for a new service delivery model\" so branches can continue to operate.",
      "Mr Makgill said that the Post Office bears the \"ultimate responsibility\" over the fate of wrongly accused sub-postmasters.",
      "\"They didn't have to take those prosecutions, they didn't have to take people to court.\"",
      "Sub-postmasters currently using the Horizon IT software continue to report issues with it. Seven in 10 said they had experienced an \"unexplained discrepancy\" on the system since January 2020, according to a YouGov survey with 1,015 respondents commissioned by the Post Office Inquiry in 2024.",
      "The Post Office has said that it has not undertaken any prosecutions related to Horizon since 2015 and \"has no intention of doing so\".",
      "It told the BBC that it is \"implementing changes across the entire organisation\" so that it is \"fit for the future, fundamentally changed and with postmasters at its heart\".",
      "It said this includes working with Fujitsu to correct discrepancies and reviewing the current version of Horizon - replacing it in stages, under a five-year plan named the \"Future Technology Portfolio\".",
      "Post Office chairman Nigel Railton has said a new IT system would not be introduced in one \"big bang\" but there would be gradual changes.",
      "The Post Office did not respond to the BBC's specific questions about IPR being the reason why the company was unable to ditch Fujitsu, and said it would not be appropriate to comment ahead of the Post Office Inquiry's final report.",
      "The Department of Business and Trade told the BBC that it was providing \u00a3136m of funding over the next five years to the Future Technology Portfolio, and was \"working at pace\" to ensure the Post Office had the technology it needed, including replacing the Horizon system.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.",

      "The official figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to push for potential trade deal with the US in Washington later to avoid import taxes hitting UK exports.",
      "The higher levels of borrowing has added to growing expectations that Reeves could cut public spending or raise taxes later this year in order to stick to her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "In response to the figures, Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, reiterated that the chancellor's rules on borrowing were \"non-negotiable\", adding that the government would \"never play fast and loose with the public finances\".",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the borrowing overshoot \"even before the influence from the tariff chaos is felt\" raised the chances of \"more tax hikes\".",
      "\"Reeves may not be too far away from having to raise money again in the Autumn Budget, by cutting spending and/or raising taxes, to meet her fiscal rules,\" she added.",
      "One of Reeves's main rules for the UK economy is not to borrow money to fund day-to-day spending.",

      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the government borrowed almost \u00a315bn more than the \u00a3137.3bn expected in the year to March due to increased spending on pay and benefits.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said the rise in borrowing was despite the government receiving a \"substantial boost in income\" from taxation.",

      "Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.",

      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\".",
      "\"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.",

      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",

      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",

      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",

    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 23:04:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.",
    "story": [
      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",
      "Stamp duty changes 'will motivate first-time buyers'",
      "'Buying a first home is harder when you're single'",

      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "Huge uncertainty",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at \u00a31,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April.",
      "The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September.",
      "Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts.",
      "\"While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. We have all seen markets go up as fast as they go down, and the very fact the market dropped so quickly shows how vulnerable it is to geopolitical and market shifts,\" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, which is widely recognised for the accuracy of its predictions.",
      "\"There is unfortunately no guarantee that any fall in prices will be sustained.",
      "\"The only real way to protect households from this constant cycle of instability and insecurity is to reduce our dependence on international wholesale markets.\"",
      "The fall in the wholesale cost of energy, paid by suppliers, is behind the latest predictions.",
      "That has been affected by US tariffs policy and warmer-than-expected weather in Europe."

These words, spoken by the then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt in the 2023 Spring Budget, were a beacon of hope for thousands of parents paying an average of almost \u00a315,000 a year to nurseries and childminders.",
      "The promise was to \"transform the lives of thousands of women\" and \"build a childcare system comparable to the best\".",
      "Two years on, the rollout of what's commonly known as the \"free hours\" scheme in England is almost complete. From September, eligible working parents will be able to access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time (for 38 weeks), paid for by the government, for their children from the age of nine months to four.",
      "Only it hasn't been the panacea that many had hoped, and there are a number of hurdles still to overcome.",
      "Parents say nursery places are increasingly difficult to find. And experts are concerned that a gap is widening between those who are eligible for the funded hours, and those who are missing out on the childcare revolution. So why has this challenge been too great for successive governments to solve?",
      "England's childcare deserts",
      "Over the last five years, access to childcare in England has declined. At the same time demand is increasing.",
      "The government estimates that by September, an additional 70,000 extra places and 35,000 staff will be needed to cope with the influx of families wanting spaces and more hours.",
      "A report by the regulator and inspector of early years, Ofsted, found that deprived areas that have lower than average incomes are disproportionately affected by persistently low access to childcare.",
      "Doncaster is a \"childcare desert\", defined as an area where parents have faced low childcare accessibility over time. There are 17 childcare places there for every 100 children.",
      "For Jordan Parker from Doncaster, the funded hours have been an \"absolute godsend\". Her two-year-old daughter Riley goes to nursery one day a week. Finding a place however has been increasing tricky.",
      "\"I have to set off at 5am for work and her Dad steps in for some mornings but he's a farmer so he works long hours, seven days a week, so I don't think we'd manage without family help.\"",
      "Olena Mykhaylyk says she put her daughter on the nursery list the moment she found out she was pregnant. \"It's crazy you have to be thinking that far ahead,\" she says.",
      "\"It's great the government offers these hours but if you can't use them, they become negligible.\"",
      "Childcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024, but from September, many families will look to increase nursery hours as the number they are eligible for doubles.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has conceded that parents in some areas may not be able to get their first choice childcare place in September. \"It is no secret that childcare in England has often been expensive and hard to find,\" Phillipson has previously said.",
      "\"This issue is historic, and in some places it is far worse than in others.\"",
      "Are school-based nurseries the solution?",
      "One of Labour's lead pledges last year was to create 100,000 additional childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries in schools.",
      "Analysis by think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), says it will increase the share of school-based provision from around 22% to 27% of the market, which is \"not nothing\", says the IFS's associate director Christine Farquharson. But she adds that is \"not going to be transformational\".",
      "It will also apply more to older children because it is easier for school-based settings to cater for three-year-olds, she adds.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said 1,200 schools had approached them about opening one. But that is still short of the number needed.",
      "Some 300 nursery schools were approved for funding in this first round, which the government says will create 6,000 new places in total. Of these, 4,000 will open in September.",
      "Avnee Morjaria, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), who worked for the DfE when the expansion programme was being developed, says the school-based nursery programme is a \"glimmer of hope\".",
      "\"If they are delivered and delivered well, I think that has got a lot of potential. It just makes sense in terms of communities and schools and nurseries being the hub of their communities to have that kind of policy.\"",
      "But for now, the system is still heavily reliant on private nurseries.",
      "Private nurseries are facing 'huge increases'",
      "There are more than 20,000 private and voluntary nurseries in the UK, which provide most early years places, but many are unhappy with the current situation and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work.",
      "Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), says most providers are facing \"huge increases\" in their operating costs from April, including statutory wage increases, changes to national insurance contributions and rising utility bills.",
      "The government says it is increasing its funding for all pre-school children to reflect the wage increases and is providing an additional \u00a375 million grant for nurseries to expand.",
      "But some nurseries say the money they receive for three-and-four-year olds is not enough and they can no longer subsidise it with the money parents pay for younger children - as from September the state will be paying for 80% of childcare in England.",
      "The DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary.",
      "This is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku.",
      "\"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\".",
      "Some nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether.",
      "But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".",
      "In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.",
      "Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.",
      "Working families and eligibility",
      "The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.",
      "To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.",
      "David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.",
      "\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.",
      "\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"",
      "The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.",
      "This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.",
      "Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.",
      "\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.",
      "\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"",
      "Question of child development",
      "The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)",
      "The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".",
      "The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.",
      "\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"",
      "In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.",
      "The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.",
      "Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.",
      "\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"",
      "She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.",
      "The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.",
      "A system under strain",
      "The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.",
      "What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.",
      "Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.",
      "It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.",
      "However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.",
      "\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"",

      "Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set.",

      "The culture secretary has said the BBC's licence fee is \"unenforceable\" and insisted \"no options are off the table\" when the government begins a review into the corporation's current funding model later this year.",
      "In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Lisa Nandy said there were \"problems\" with the annual charge, with \"fewer and fewer people\" paying the \u00a3174.50 fee.",
      "The charter, which expires in 2027 and is under review, is an agreement between the BBC and the government that sets out the terms and purposes of the corporation - including the existence of the licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said the broadcaster looks forward to engaging with the government and securing the long-term future of the BBC.",
      "Nandy has already started negotiations with the BBC about the corporation's funding.",
      "It currently gets most of its income from the licence fee - in the last financial year, the BBC received \u00a33.7bn, or about two-thirds of its total income, from it.",
      "\"We're open to a different system,\" she told the Telegraph, but admitted no preferred options had been put forward yet.",
      "She added the government wanted the public's input in shaping the new model to create \"a fairer, more sustainable system\".",
      "According to the BBC, 80% of households currently pay the licence fee.",
      "Nandy said: \"We recognise there are problems with the licence fee. Fewer and fewer people are paying it.",
      "\"It's unenforceable and, particularly, I've been very concerned about the way it's been enforced in the past, with women - particularly vulnerable women - targeted for enforcement action, and the BBC itself has accepted that.\"",
      "Two BBC reviews found the gender disparity had been due to societal factors.",
      "The review in 2017 detailed a gender skew towards women-only households, a greater likelihood of women answering the door to TV Licensing Enquiry Officers and a higher chance of them engaging positively with an officer.",
      "In 2023, the BBC set out plans to reduce the high proportion of women being prosecuted for licence fee evasion, after figures showed that they made up 76% of the 52,376 people convicted over it in 2020.",
      "Nandy has previously said the charge was \"deeply regressive\" and that she was thinking \"quite radically and creatively\" about alternatives. But the minister has ruled out using general taxation to fund the BBC.",
      "She did, however, keep open the possibility of a subscription model.",
      "Last month in a Sunday Times interview, the corporation's chairman suggested wealthier households could be charged more.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said: \"The public cares about the BBC and we have launched our biggest ever public engagement exercise, so audiences can help drive and shape what they want from a universal and independent BBC in the future.",

      "On the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase, a Louis Theroux documentary and enough clout to run his own festival.",
      "But if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.",
      "And the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised after long queues and a lack of water caused fans to pass out and miss the concert.",
      "Harrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.",
      "\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"",
      "The problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.",
      "\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.",
      "\"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\"",
      "Nowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single, Hello Heaven, Hello.",
      "Over nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda.",
      "\"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition.",
      "The song's purposefully unsuited to radio \u2013 unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment.",
      "Combining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.",
      "\"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says.",
      "\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"",
      "Warming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited.",
      "\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"",
      "To achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds.",
      "Professional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.",
      "\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.",
      "\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"",
      "'Sexiness and liberation'",
      "One of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".",
      "\"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'd developed an eating disorder due to body dysmorphia.",
      "\"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\"",
      "He ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news after Russia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina.",
      "\"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me.",
      "\"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\"",
      "Fans have noticed the change\u2026 drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\".",
      "\"Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had,\" he laughs.",
      "\"I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation.\"",
      "He's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame.",
      "Part of that is down to control. In January, he created a new company that brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest.",
      "The event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues.",
      "\"I will fully take responsibility for that,\" says the star, who claims he was \"backstage screaming\" at police and promoters to get the lines moving.",
      "\"The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12,\" he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication.",
      "\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.",
      "\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"",
      "Dedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud.",
      "He built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement.",
      "Maintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts.",
      "\"She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city.",
      "\"She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling.",
      "\"If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger.\"",
      "With his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll \"reclaim the good chords\" (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering).",
      "\"The shackles are off,\" he grins.",
      "\"We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play.",
      "\"Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.\""

    "story": [
      "A police watchdog has complained to Ofcom over an episode of Panorama about the shooting of Chris Kaba.",
      "The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) went to the broadcasting watchdog after its request for a public apology from the BBC went unmet, after the programme initially aired without including the IOPC's statement in response to claims made by its own former regional director Sal Naseem.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation's own Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) ruling had judged the complaint to be \"resolved\" after it had been accepted as an oversight not to include the IOPC's point of view; the iPlayer version and online article were quickly amended.",
      "Mr Kaba was shot dead after he tried to ram his way out of a police vehicle stop in south London in September 2022.",
      "Sgt Martyn Blake, an officer in the specialist firearms unit MO19, was found not guilty of murder in October last year, prompting protests from the Kaba family.",
      "Speaking after the verdict at the Old Bailey, Mr Kaba's family said it was \"painful proof that our lives are not valued by the system\".",
      "Mr Naseem told BBC Panorama that in his opinion, he had not been convinced that Mr Kaba presented a sufficient danger to justify being shot.",
      "He suggested that the murder investigation into Mr Blake was launched amid pressure over potential unrest, which is denied by the IOPC.",
      "The IOPC complained that the programme did not make clear that Mr Naseem no longer works for the watchdog, and that it was not given the proper right to reply to the claims over why the investigation was launched.",
      "In the programme, Mr Naseem said that when the IOPC launched its homicide investigation four days after the shooting, \"It was fed back to us... that if we hadn't done it at that time then it's likely there would have been a level of disorder.\"",
      "The IOPC's statement denying this was added to the iPlayer version of the Panorama episode and online news stories.",
      "The statement read: \"The decisions to criminally investigate Sergeant Blake, and then refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), followed careful consideration of a significant amount of evidence gathered during our independent investigation and by applying the relevant legal tests which govern our work.\"",
      "According to the BBC complaint unit's judgement, Panorama should have provided the IOPC with specific information about the claims to be made about it, and therefore found an element of unfairness to the IOPC.",
      "However it noted the programme makers had taken subsequent action to include the organisation's right to reply in the iPlayer version and related online article, which was deemed \"sufficient to resolve this aspect of the complaint.\"",
      "But the IOPC said on Thursday it had complained to Ofcom because it was \"hugely dissatisfied that, despite admitting these two breaches of its own guidelines, the BBC has steadfastly refused to apologise publicly despite the IOPC providing evidence to show the serious reputational damage caused to the organisation as a result of the programme.",
      "\"In particular, the suggestion within that programme, that the IOPC was pressured to start a homicide investigation, was wrong and resulted in public criticism from a number of media organisations and individuals including concerns raised by the London Assembly and local councillors about the IOPC's independence and motivations.",
      "\"Had we been aware this would be suggested, we would have strongly refuted it.\"",

    "story": [
      "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.",
      "The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".",
      "The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.",
      "The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.",
      "Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".",
      "\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.",
      "Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.",
      "He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.",
      "With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".",
      "\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"",
      "Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.",
      "The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.",
      "Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.",
      "He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.",
      "\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"",
      "He reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"",
      "The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.",
      "In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.",
      "It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"",
      "She continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"",
      "'The politics of Paddington'",
      "Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.",
      "\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"",
      "As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".",
      "\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"",
      "Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".",
      "He added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"",
      "The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.",
      "\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"",
      "Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.",
      "\"You can rest easy,\" laughed Swale. \"Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.\"",

    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker has said he believes the BBC wanted him to leave Match of the Day as he was negotiating a new contract last year.",
      "The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\"",
      "The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\".",
      "However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\".",
      "A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January.",
      "Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\"",
      "However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.",
      "\"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained.",
      "But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.",
      "\"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\"",
      "Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.",
      "BBC suspension",
      "Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.",
      "The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.",
      "Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "\"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.",
      "\"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\"",
      "He continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\"",
      "The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".",
      "The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\".",
      "Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.",
      "While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.",
      "Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\".",
      "\"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\"",
      "Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\".",
      "The BBC updated its social media guidance in 2023 following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets.",
      "The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\".",
      "Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\"",
      "Gaza doc",
      "Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures, signed an open later urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.",
      "The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Lineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\"",
      "He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\".",
      "\"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation.",
      "The BBC said it had identified serious flaws in the making of the documentary. The BBC board said the mistakes were \"significant and damaging\".",
      "Gambling in sport",
      "In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports.",
      "Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms.",
      "\"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are one of the world's most famous power couples.",
      "And they now have an equally famous family, with daughter Blue Ivy, 13, and seven-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir.",
      "But Beyonc\u00e9's mother, businesswoman and fashion designer Tina Knowles, tells me she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.",
      "\"If I had my first choice, they would not have to deal with the things that they have to deal with as kids,\" she says.",
      "Knowles, 71, says for now, the children are not too exposed to it.",
      "\"But one day they'll read the ignorance that people put out there about them, the lies and all of that,\" she says. \"And I do worry about that.\"",
      "Despite those pressures, she says Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z - who are notoriously private about their home life - are doing an \"amazing\" job as parents.",
      "\"The truth is they spend abnormal amount of time with their children and they have great relationships with their kids,\" she says.",
      "\"And they're just great parents. I don't think you could ask for better parents.\"",
      "Knowles is speaking to BBC News ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Matriarch.",
      "It covers her childhood in Texas, her daughters' rise to fame and her later years, as a grandmother.",
      "Knowles now has four grandchildren, including Julez Smith, the son of her younger daughter, singer-songwriter Solange. She also considers herself a grandmother to former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland's children.",
      "She says that she sees all her grandchildren regularly, describing them as \"one of the biggest joys in my life\".",
      "\"[Blue Ivy and I] have a very close bond,\" she says of her eldest granddaughter.",
      "\"I'm so happy that she feels like she can talk to me,\" she says, adding that Blue Ivy is always giving her advice about taking care of herself.",
      "\"She's my beauty guru. She's my manager,\" she says.",
      "I'm intrigued by this, and ask why she calls the 13-year-old her manager.",
      "\"Well, I don't call her my manager. Everybody else calls her my manager, because she's bossy. She's a little Capricorn like me. So we have that bond.\"",
      "Knowles grew up in 50s and 60s Galveston, the youngest of seven.",
      "In her book, she talks about the harassment her family faced, including from the police.",
      "\"There was a lot of racial tension,\" she tells me. \"And I think some things have changed, but I still think that black people are more susceptible to police brutality [and] being stopped.\"",
      "She met her now ex-husband, Mathew Knowles, in Houston and the pair went on to have two daughters, Beyonc\u00e9 in 1981 and Solange five years later.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, she writes, was \"not an easy baby\". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (\"she cried louder\" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.",
      "As a child, Solange was a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d but Beyonc\u00e9 was shy. \"She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,\" Knowles writes.",
      "She says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being \"bombarded\" by messages from mainstream culture that they were \"less than\".",
      "But Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.",
      "\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.",
      "\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"",
      "Knowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.",
      "\"Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,\" she says.",
      "\"It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.\"",
      "None of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.",
      "\"I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,\" she says.",
      "In the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.",
      "The band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.",
      "Knowles, who ran a hair salon Headliners and had learned dressmaking, made costumes for the group, while Mathew Knowles quit his job to manage them.",
      "Their daughters have gone on to forge hugely successful solo careers.",
      "Solange won a Grammy Award for Cranes in the Sky, while Beyonc\u00e9 has had countless hits including Single Ladies, Crazy in Love, Halo and Irreplaceable.",
      "She finally won best album at this year's Grammy Awards - correcting what was widely seen as an historic wrong.",

      "Why Beyonc\u00e9 is reclaiming country music",
      "In an Instagram post ahead of her album launch, Beyonc\u00e9 said Cowboy Carter was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcome\" that prompted her to take \"a deeper dive into the history of country\".",
      "Many interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.",
      "Knowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.",
      "\"She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,\" she says.",
      "She added it was \"interesting\" to hear some saying Beyonc\u00e9 is \"not country Western\" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.",
      "\"It is in her. It\u2019s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.\"",
      "As her daughters rose to international fame, they have had to deal with media pressure and trolling - including, Knowles writes, the speculation that Beyonc\u00e9 was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy.",
      "There was also an infamous argument between Solange and her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator in 2014, which was leaked by celebrity site TMZ.",
      "Knowles refuses to be drawn on the lift incident.",
      "But when asked how she protects her daughters from comments and trolling online, she says it's actually them who protect her.",
      "\u201cThey are very astute at blocking out the bull and the lies. And do they hurt them? Sure, but they don't even focus on that,\" she says.",
      "\"While the world is creating lies and mess, my girls are somewhere in the studio or with their kids minding their business and living their best life.\"",
      "She refuses to take credit for keeping her daughters grounded.",
      "\"I didn't keep them on the straight and narrow. They are just very sensible people with balance in their life,\" she says.",
      "Knowles also opens up in her book about being diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in her left breast, after doctors discovered two tumours.",
      "She is now cancer free.",
      "\"My daughters and my faith carried me through,\" she writes.",
      "The next generation of superstars?",
      "So what's next for this family of superstars?",
      "Knowles is optimistic, saying \"the sky's the limit\" when it comes to what her daughters might do next.",
      "As for her grandchildren, she says they are being nurtured in \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed in the show business\".",
      "At just 13, Blue Ivy has already made strides in her career. Last year, she voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King, and she also performed alongside her mother on her Renaissance tour.",
      "But Knowles says that's something Blue Ivy had to \"work for\".",

      "As for whether we can expect Matriarch to be adapted into a reality series, Knowles is reticent.",

    "story": [
      "Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.",
      "If you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.",
      "But in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention.",
      "Content creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.",
      "Latey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette).",
      "Ten women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas.",
      "Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.",
      "Broadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.",
      "Winning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".",
      "Of course, not everyone feels the same way.",
      "\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.",
      "\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"",
      "Mr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.",
      "Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"",
      "Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"",
      "Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.",
      "\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.",
      "\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"",
      "Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.",
      "In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.",
      "Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.",
      "\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.",
      "Elsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.",
      "By baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.",
      "Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.",
      "\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.",
      "\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"",
      "She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\"",
      "Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"",
      "A second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"",
      "Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.",
      "This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.",
      "\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.",
      "As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.",
      "\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.",
      "But Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".",
      "She is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.",
      "\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "Supported housing, which helps vulnerable or disabled people live independently, is in crisis, an open letter signed by more than 170 organisations in the sector claims.",
      "Services at one in three providers in England had to shut last year, adding to a total shortfall of about 325,000 places, says the letter, which will be delivered to Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. Signatories to it include Refuge, Age UK and the National Housing Federation (NHF).",
      "Blaming cuts to council funding and rising costs, the NHF says a further one in three providers fear they may close unless the government pledges more money.",
      "The government says supported housing is vital and it is focused on building more homes.",
      "About half a million people in the UK currently live in supported housing, including young care leavers, army veterans, people with learning disabilities and those escaping homelessness or domestic abuse.",
      "\"Supported housing plays an indispensable role in cutting NHS waiting list backlogs, and reducing pressure on social care, temporary accommodation, and other vital public services,\" the open letter says.",
      "However, it says the future of supported housing is now at risk following \"years of funding cuts\" and that local authorities have now been forced to \"decommission vital services\".",
      "\"Rising costs alongside reduced funding have rendered many services unviable, forcing many to close, while demand for supported housing continues to rise. The decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has placed even further pressure on providers' budgets.\"",
      "The organisations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support of at least \u00a31.6bn per year for councils and for supported homes to be among the 1.5 million new houses planned by the government.",
      "\"We recognise the vital role played by supported housing in helping vulnerable people to live independently and well, and the contribution it makes to tackling rough sleeping and timely hospital discharge,\" a spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said.",
      "The spokesperson said the government was putting \u00a32bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27, with further details to be set out in a long-term housing strategy later this year.",
      "Proponents of austerity measures say tough funding choices need to be made to balance the UK's finances.",
      "However, Shaoxiong Liu says his family do not know what they would have done without a supported housing place for his son Jason.",
      "Aged 39, Jason has autism, a learning disability and mental health challenges. As he grew older, this became increasingly unmanageable for his family. After falling ill, Jason was admitted to hospital with sepsis in 2017.",
      "Due to his challenging behaviour and a condition that induces severe vomiting, he remained in hospital for months as they struggled to find somewhere long term that could accommodate his needs.",
      "He was eventually placed with Advance Housing, where his family says Jason has flourished in the intervening eight years. His weight has risen from 35kg to 53kg, he can go on bus trips and attends social events organised by the housing provider.",
      "\"Jason's behaviour is so much better now. He's lived there so long and he's happy there,\" Mr Liu says. \"Jason is an adult now and we are in our 70s, so his behaviour could be quite dangerous for us if he lived with us - we couldn't look after him.\"",
      "The NHF says one in three providers in England it surveyed say they may have to stop providing services altogether, meaning the loss of 70,000 supported homes across the country.",
      "In 2009, ringfenced council funding for housing-related support was removed. When council budgets were cut during austerity from 2010, funding was needed in other areas, meaning some councils had to cut supported housing services.",
      "The NHF says that means there are now fewer supported homes than in 2007, including a net loss of 3,000 supported homes in the last three years. It calculates there is a total shortfall of up to 325,000 supported homes, based on unmet need.",

      "Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.",
      "\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"",

      "Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.",

      "Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.",
      "Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.",
      "As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.",
      "It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.",
      "Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.",
      "From milligrams to whole nuts",
      "Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.",
      "By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.",
      "Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".",
      "\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.",
      "\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"",
      "The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.",
      "\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"",
      "This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.",
      "Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.",
      "\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"",
      "But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.",
      "\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"",
      "However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.",
      "'Wonderful feeling'",
      "Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.",
      "\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"",
      "Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.",
      "How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.",
      "And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.",
      "Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay \u2013 as recommended by his doctors.",
      "He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.",
      "While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.",

    "summary": "NHS safety body wants a focus on staff fatigue as it warns of mistakes and impaired decision-making.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients, England's NHS safety watchdog warns.",
      "The Health Services Safety Investigations Body said medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention and rude and disrespectful behaviour were the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals.",
      "It said there was limited data on the scale of the problem, but cited evidence from staff surveys and information provided by safety experts that it was a contributory factor in safety incidents.",
      "In its report, the watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs.",
      "In one case a mother and baby were harmed after an inaccurate scan, with the staff member saying fatigue and workload contributed.",
      "In the chemotherapy case the staff were nearly nine hours into a 12.5-hour day shift and had only managed five to six hours of sleep between shifts and had limited breaks because of staffing pressures.",
      "The hospital investigation found fatigue was \"likely to have been a factor\".",
      "Sleep-deprived",
      "Some staff reported being sleep-deprived on a daily basis.",
      "And one doctor told the watchdog: \"When it gets to that third day of doing these 12-hour nights it's dangerous from 2am onwards... do I have the energy or the brain space or the mental space to even make a life-changing decision for a patient at this point?\"",
      "The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work.",
      "Shift work, long working hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities and financial pressures were all cited as factors in staff fatigue.",
      "The watchdog said the issue was often misunderstood in the NHS and thought of more as a wellbeing issue rather than a safety issue.",
      "It said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.",
      "Support available",
      "Senior safety investigator Saskia Fursland said: \"Fatigue is more than just being tired - it can significantly impair decision-making, motor skills, and alertness.",
      "\"We must move away from viewing fatigue as an individual issue and putting the onus on personal responsibility and instead treat it as a system-level risk that deserves urgent attention.\"",
      "Dr Latifa Patel, of the British Medical Association, said the findings were concerning, but not surprising with doctors facing long shifts back-to-back with little respite.",
      "She said there needed to be better rota design to ensure staff could rest properly between shifts and improved rest facilities in hospitals.",
      "But she said fatigue was also \"often driven by workforce shortages\" too.",
      "A spokesperson for NHS England said it recognised staff were at risk of burnout and was \"committed\" to ensuring they got the support they needed to provide safe care.",
      "\"Staff should always feel confident to report patient safety concerns, including those that are linked to fatigue, and we will work with local NHS systems to address any issues,\" he added.",
      "He said the NHS was offering more flexible working options than ever before and there was a range of mental health support available for staff.",

      "But the surgeries have come at a physical cost.",
      "Sitting in front of a mirror inside her luxury duplex apartment in Beijing, she gently dabs concealer onto bruises from a recent face-slimming injection - a procedure she undergoes monthly to help her face appear \"firmer and less chubby\" after three jaw reduction surgeries removed too much bone.",

      "\"The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call.\"",
      "Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media.",
      "Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures.",
      "Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25.",
      "While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing.",
      "For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face.",

      "Cosmetic surgery apps like SoYoung (New Oxygen) and GengMei (More Beautiful) - claiming to offer algorithm-driven analysis of \"facial imperfections\" - have been surging in popularity.",
      "After scanning and assessing users' faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation.",
      "These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what's considered desirable and normal.",
      "As one of China's earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched.",
      "Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung's \"magic mirror\" feature, the app still points out \"imperfections\" and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries.",
      "\"It says I have eye bags. Get a chin augmentation? I've done that.\"",
      "Abby seems amused.",
      "\"Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?\"",
      "Unlike typical e-commerce sites, beauty apps like SoYoung also offer a social media function. Users share detailed before-and-after diaries and often ask superusers like Abby for their advice.",
      "'My skin felt like there was cement underneath'",
      "To meet surging demand, clinics are opening up rapidly across China.",
      "But there's a shortage of qualified practitioners and large numbers of clinics are operating without a licence.",
      "According to a report by iResearch, a marketing research firm, as of 2019, 80,000 venues in China were providing cosmetic procedures without a licence and 100,000 cosmetic practitioners were working without the right qualifications.",
      "As a result, it's estimated that hundreds of accidents are happening every day inside Chinese cosmetic surgery clinics.",
      "Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing.",
      "\"I've seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,\" Dr Yang says.",
      "\"Some even had surgery inside people's homes.\"",
      "Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have had surgery that went badly wrong.",
      "In 2020 she received baby face collagen injections - designed to make the face appear more plump - from an unlicensed clinic opened by a close friend. But the fillers hardened.",
      "\"My skin felt like there was cement underneath,\" she says.",
      "Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse.",
      "One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose.",
      "Another clinic tried lifting the skin near her ears to reach the filler underneath, leaving her with two long scars and a face that looked unnaturally tight.",
      "\"My entire image collapsed. I lost my shine and it's affected my work [in human resources for a foreign company in Shanghai] too.\"",
      "She found Dr Yang through SoYoung last year and has since undergone three repair surgeries, including for her eyelids which were damaged during a previous operation by another clinic.",
      "But while Dr Yang's surgeries have brought visible improvements, some of the damage from the botched procedures may be permanent.",
      "\"I don't want to become prettier any more,\" she says.",

      "\"My face was disfigured and I was very down. It ruined my acting career.\"",
      "She had received the nose surgery at a licensed Guangzhou clinic called She's Times from Dr He Ming, who was described as its \"chief surgeon\" and a nose surgery expert.",
      "But in reality Dr He was not fully qualified to perform the surgery without supervision and had not obtained his licensed plastic surgeon status from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission.",
      "Authorities fined the clinic, which closed soon after the scandal, and barred Dr He from practising for six months.",
      "However, weeks before She's Times was officially dissolved, a new clinic, Qingya, requested to register at the same address.",
      "BBC Eye has found strong links between She's Times and Qingya, such as the same Weibo account and the retention of several staff, including Dr He.",
      "The BBC has also learned that Dr He only obtained the licensed plastic surgeon qualification in April 2024, even though he was technically barred from applying for the status for five years from the date he was sanctioned in 2021.",
      "Qingya now claims to have opened 30 branches.",
      "Dr He, Qingya and Guangdong Provincial Health Commission did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.",

      "One receptionist role asks for candidates to be \"at least 160cm tall and aesthetically pleasing\", while an administrative job demands \"an appealing look and an elegant presence\".",
      "And now that pressure is being exploited by a growing scam in some Chinese clinics in which vulnerable young women are offered jobs, but only if they pay for expensive surgeries carried out by their would-be employers.",
      "Da Lan, not her real name, applied for a \"beauty consultant\" job at a clinic in Chengdu, south-western China, on a popular recruitment website in March 2024.",
      "After the interview, she was offered the position that same evening.",
      "But she says when she began her role the next morning, she was taken to a small room by her manager, who scanned her up and down and gave her an ultimatum - get cosmetic work done or lose out on the job.",
      "Da Lan says she was given less than an hour to decide.",
      "Under pressure, she agreed to undergo double eyelid surgery - priced at over 13,000 yuan (\u00a31,330) - more than three times the monthly salary of the role - with more than 30% annual interest.",
      "She says staff took her phone and used it to apply for a so-called \"beauty loan,\" falsifying her income details. Within a minute, the loan was approved.",

      "Outside of the UK, you can watch the documentary on YouTube.",
      "The surgery did nothing for her job prospects. Da Lan says her manager belittled her, shouting her name in public and swearing at her.",
      "She quit after just a few weeks. Looking back, she believes the job was never real.",
      "\"They wanted me to leave from the beginning,\" she says.",
      "Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months.",
      "BBC Eye spoke to dozens of victims, and met three including Da Lan in Chengdu, a city that has set out to become China's \"capital of cosmetic surgery\". Some have been trapped in much larger debt for years.",
      "The clinic Da Lan says scammed her had previously been reported by other graduates and exposed by local media, but it remains open and is still recruiting for the same role.",
      "This scam isn't limited to clinic jobs - it's creeping into other industries.",
      "Some live-streaming companies pressure young women to take out loans for surgery, promising a shot at influencer fame.",

      "Paul Leighton is packing his rucksack with a heavy-duty hammer, pry bar and evidence bags for what he describes as \"just an average day out\".",
      "As the senior Trading Standards officer at Newcastle City Council, he has learned the hiding places used to conceal illegal vapes can be sophisticated. Sometimes, he has to force his way in.",
      "He has found them hidden everywhere from inside fridges and barbecues to behind fake fuse boxes and tiled panels complete with hydraulic lifts.",
      "\"I've seen entire kitchens come away from walls and off the floor as well\u2026 so all sorts of hiding places,\" he says.",
      "Classified as illicit or non-compliant vapes, the products he will be searching for today fail to meet the legal requirements for sale in the UK.",
      "More than six million of them were seized in England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC.",
      "The health risks posed to unwitting customers are summed up by Connor Lamb, a senior technician for licensing also taking part in the unannounced checks on shops.",
      "If you get a normal vape, he says, \"they've got a capacity which is enough for 600 puffs - the equivalent to 20 cigarettes\".",
      "But if you get an illegal one, \"it can be anything from 200 cigarettes in one vape. Obviously someone buying this to go on a night out or a kid might just be chuffing on it all day and you can imagine the drastic effect that'll have on someone's lungs.\"",
      "According to Trading Standards, illicit or non-compliant vapes can be anything with tank sizes greater than 2ml, a nicotine strength of more than 20ml or labels that do not display manufacturer details and health warnings.",
      "The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency strongly advises consumers not to use them as the true content - and any possible health risk - is unknown.",
      "On the road, Paul and Connor quickly find a stash of between 12 and 20 packs of illegal vapes at the back of a shop counter.",
      "\"It would be unusual to have so few in a shop that sells quite frequently like this, so it's just a case of where they're hiding the rest,\" says Paul.",
      "We head to a room at the back of the shop. There is a stench of urine. It is full of litter and we are deep in seemingly empty cardboard boxes.",
      "Paul's hunch is proven right though as a search among the rubbish unearths a box of illegal vapes.",
      "How widespread are illegal vapes?",
      "Of 136 local Trading Standards bodies in England, 133 responded to BBC Freedom of Information requests, showing that between 2022 and 2024:",
      "At least 6,169,822 illicit or non-compliant vaping products were seized, including those taken at ports as well as in shopsThere were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than onceRetailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",

      "There were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than once",
      "Retailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",
      "Selling illegal vapes was a factor in at least 316 shop closures during that period, while selling to children was a factor in at least 67. Most of the closures were temporary and some retailers may have been shut down more than once.",
      "The Independent British Vape Trade Association (IBVTA) insists the majority of vape shops operate within the law, serving adults who would otherwise be smoking.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"These business owners would never knowingly involve themselves in criminal activity. Rather, it is since the resurgence of popularity of single-use vapes, and therefore a popular 'cash market', that we've seen organised crime gangs get involved in importing and distributing vapes.\"",
      "They said IBVTA had long called for greater enforcement action at borders to stem the flow of illegal products entering the country.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said it was allocating an extra \u00a310m this financial year for Trading Standards to tackle underage and illicit sales, with an expected 80 additional apprentice enforcement officers to be funded.",
      "Paul and Connor agree single-use vapes are among the main driving forces of the illegal trade and hope the coming ban will improve the situation.",
      "\"These are quite sophisticated networks that we're up against who are also involved in lots of quite serious activities as well as modern day slavery, trafficking, drug supply,\" says Paul.",
      "\"I think we'll see a lot less product taken off the street because we haven't really had a massive issue with reusable vapes for quite some time.",
      "\"They've always been broadly compliant in terms of the devices that are being used, the batteries, the liquids, the odd oversized tank here.\"",
      "When does the disposable vapes ban start?",
      "From 1 June, it will be illegal for businesses in the UK to sell, supply or possess single-use vapes for sale.",
      "Those caught doing so will get a \u00a3200 on-the-spot fine in the first instance, rising to an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences.",
      "The government has said Trading Standards will be able to keep the full value of the on-the-spot fines, to reinvest into enforcement.",
      "Extra enforcement powers and funding are something IBVTA says it welcomes, noting \"not all Trading Standards teams are equally or adequately resourced\" and \"some areas with low regulatory compliance are unable to carry out the enforcement they would want to\".",
      "But a national spokesperson for Trading Standards said its work was \"definitely having an impact\".",
      "Government funding had enabled \"extra boots on the ground\" at Heathrow Airport and Dover Port, the spokesperson said, which explained the high number of seizures by the local authorities home to those border points \u2013 Hillingdon and Kent.",
      "In Hillingdon alone, 2,099,248 vaping products were seized between 2022-2024, making up a third of the total.",
      "They said Salford was home to a number of vape warehouses supplying products across England, meaning \"seizing at this stage in the supply chain is really effective\".",
      "However, they said there was still a \"huge challenge in terms of retailers prepared to sell illegal products as well as those who persistently sell to children\".",
      "Back in Newcastle, Paul offers a similar assessment of the task faced nationally.",
      "He estimates the number of illegal vapes still circulating in the country is \"easily in the millions at the moment\", adding: \"It's a constant battle trying to make a difference.\"",

      "It's early morning outside theatre, and a team of specialist medical experts gather for a briefing to discuss the unprecedented surgery about to take place.",
      "Vanellope still has no breastbone, leaving her heart covered by just by a thin layer of skin.",
      "Surgeons have come up with a plan to use her ribs to form a protective cage inside her chest.",
      "Consultant paediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was one of the 50-strong medical team at Vanellope's birth on 22 November.",
      "Now he is set to play a leading role again in surgery, which has never been performed like this before.",
      "\"I'd lie if I say I don't get nervous,\" he says. \"But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you're doing something that will change somebody's life.\"",
      "He remembers how \"everything was unknown\" when Vanellope was born, because no-one in the country had ever dealt with a similar case.",
      "A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition.",
      "Ectopia cordis affects only a few cases per million births - and Vanellope was given a less than 10% chance of survival.",
      "But she defied those odds and was allowed home after 14 months in hospital.",
      "Since then, Vanellope has had to wear a brace around her chest to protect her heart.",
      "She has complex medical needs, which require one-to-one care, 24 hours a day. She is autistic and non-verbal.",
      "Mum Naomi Findlay, 39, who lives in Clifton, Nottingham, described her daughter as \"a happy little thing\" who \"brings a lot of joy and a lot of happiness\".",
      "She added: \"It makes me extremely proud to see actually how how far she's come, what she's overcome and what she is achieving. It's a real journey of strength and bravery... she's so brave.\"",
      "Having to kiss her daughter goodbye at the theatre door is difficult and the tears flow.",
      "\"A lot of anxiety, a lot of worry and so many emotions,\" she says. \"For me, the biggest fear is handing her over and not getting her back.\"",
      "The team waiting in theatre include specialists from the Congenital Heart Centre, Leicester Children's Hospital and a visiting cardiothoracic surgeon from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.",
      "Consultant congenital cardiac surgeon, Ikenna Omeje, operated on Vanellope just 50 minutes after she was born.",
      "He recalls there being a lot of \"head scratching\" among surgeons, because the condition was so rare.",
      "\"It was exciting for everyone because it was something we had never seen before. So you made the news, not just within the UK, but all over the world,\" he says.",
      "Explaining the current procedure, he points to a 3D scan of Vanellope's chest, and describes how her heart has attached to the thin layer of skin protecting it.",
      "Detaching it \"is risky\", he confesses.",
      "\"You can damage the vessel trying to get into the chest cavity,\" he said.",
      "Now aged seven, surgeons decided Vanellope had reached the right age for reconstructive surgery to form a permanent structure around her heart.",
      "Vanellope is first placed on a bypass machine, which temporarily takes over the functions of the heart and lungs.",
      "This allows her heart to deflate, allowing the \"very tricky\" procedure to detach part of her heart - the right ventricular outflow tract - and the pulmonary artery from where it has stuck to her skin.",
      "Next, the bilateral rib osteotomy takes place, which involves breaking Vanellope's ribs on both sides to move them in order to form the protective cage around her heart.",
      "Carrying out all of the procedures at once, on a patient with ectopia cordis, has never been done in this country before, the team says.",
      "The extremely complex procedure lasts more than nine hours. And it's a success. The surgeons are delighted.",
      "Mr Omeje is beaming as he says it \"went a lot better than we expected\".",
      "He describes how he examined an X-ray of Vanellope's chest after the operation, and called it \"really beautiful\".",
      "Mr Omeje called Vanellope \"one of a kind\" and explained how fulfilling it was to have everything go so well.",
      "\"The best satisfaction we derive from this is when you get a text message from the mum to say 'thank you, you guys are amazing',\" he says.",
      "\"I think personally, I have just done my job, but it has made a difference to someone and that is very satisfying.\"",
      "Vanellope is taken to the children's paediatric intensive care unit and will spend some time in hospital recovering.",
      "After a few weeks, she will be able to take off her protective chest brace and won't require any further surgery in the future.",
      "Her mum called the NHS \"amazing\", and says she can't wait to take her home to her older brothers and little sister.",
      "Looking to the future, she hopes this surgery will improve Vanellope's \"already really, really good quality of life\".",
      "And Naomi says this time, she's ready for the long journey ahead.",
      "\"When [Vanellope] was born I was fearful. It was very scary for me, but this time round I'm ready.",

    "summary": "Blind influencer Lucy Edwards on choosing IVF which will screen out the gene that made her who she is.",
    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",
      "\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"",
      "Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.",
      "NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.",
      "\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"",
      "Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",
      "A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.",
      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",
      "\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"",

      "The UK's trade relationship with the EU is arguably \"more important\" than the one it has with the US, the chancellor has told the BBC.",
      "Rachel Reeves suggested that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US.",
      "After her meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, Reeves tweeted that both the UK and US want a deal that is \"in both our national interests\".",
      "Earlier this week, she signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports from their current 10% to 2.5% as part of a wider deal.",
      "The UK is preparing for a summit with the EU in May in an attempt to \"reset\" the relationship between the two.",
      "\"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"Obviously I've been meeting Scott Bessent this week whilst I'm in Washington, but I've also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers - because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we're going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the chancellor's remarks had been \"a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner\".",

      "She has said she wants to see \"free and fair\" trade, and wants to deepen the relationship between the US and UK in areas such as technology.",
      "Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith told Sky News that his party would \"absolutely be seeking to prioritise\" a deal with the US over the EU.",
      "Griffith argued that the UK already had a tariff-free deal on goods with the EU, therefore the \"next best choice if you want to grow the economy after the chancellor's crashed it would be to get a deal with the US\".",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The chancellor is absolutely right that our trading relationship with Europe is more important, but the government's approach so far shows these are little more than empty words.",
      "\"This government has bent over backwards to appease Donald Trump but barely lifted a finger to unleash growth by boosting trade with Europe.\"",
      "'We're all grappling with tariffs'",
      "Regarding the situation with the US, Reeves said she \"understands what President [Donald] Trump wants to address\" with his tariffs, ahead of talks with her US counterpart in Washington.",
      "Reeves said there were similarities with the way both the US and UK governments had come to power off the back of voter frustration with the economy.",
      "\"We're all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why President Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,\" she said.",
      "Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US including from the UK.",
      "The UK also faces a broader tariff rate of 10% and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies \u2013 most of which are currently on pause until July.",
      "Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.",
      "Reeves said she had also been working closely with European and Canadian counterparts to remove trade barriers, and that conversations around the table at G20 meetings this week had been difficult.",
      "\"Obviously there are strains. We are all following what's happening in our domestic bond markets, in our equity markets, and we all know that that uncertainty is bad for investment in the UK economy.\"",

      "Tax rises in October's Budget are \"crippling\" her salon business, she said, and the extra \u00a323,000 a year imposed by the chancellor could prove the final nail in the coffin.",
      "\"I have been crying myself to sleep because, since October, this has been the worst period of my personal life in 30 years,\" she said.",
      "\"I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can't take wages if I don't make a profit.",
      "\"I could lose my house if the business folds - that is the reality and if things don't change it is frightening the life out of me.\"",
      "'I don't have the margin to invest in apprentices'",
      "'Perfect storm' could see end of salon apprenticeships",
      "'We're always hammered' - Beauty industry ahead of budget",
      "The government says the tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves were needed to stabilise the economy.",
      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from about \u00a37,000 to about \u00a318,000 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",
      "Update 26 April 2025: This article was amended to correct the cost of Kerry's business rates, which she said increased from about \u00a37,000, not from \u00a3700 as we originally stated.",

    "summary": "An agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations for a post-Brexit \"reset\".",
    "story": [
      "The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to \"reset\" relations after Brexit.",
      "Labour has previously said it has \"no plans\" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad.",
      "But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a \"running commentary\" on talks.",
      "It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a \"new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30\".",
      "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
      "EU chief 'surprised' at fish status in Brexit talks",
      "In a letter to EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, they argued a mutual deal for time-limited visas, subject to a cap, would \"extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK\".",
      "Sir Keir Starmer met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May.",
      "Following the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Discussing the ongoing negotiations to strengthen the UK-EU partnership, they both agreed that good progress had been made.",
      "\"They asked their teams to continue their important work in the coming weeks, with the aim of delivering as ambitious a package as possible at the first UK-EU summit next month.\"",
      "The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine.",
      "A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a \u20ac150bn (\u00a3128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme.",
      "Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a \"package approach\" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.",
      "He added that EU citizens had faced \"many obstacles\" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including \"very high thresholds\" for skilled work visas.",
      "Existing schemes",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "Applicants from these countries need at least \u00a32,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of \u00a3776 for students and \u00a31,035 for workers.",
      "The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth deal in April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.",
      "Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.",
      "It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.",
      "'Youth experience'",
      "There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.",
      "Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\".",
      "The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.",
      "Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration.",
      "But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.",
      "During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".",
      "She added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"",
      "Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".",
      "An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU.",
      "In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended."

      "Kogan, who will now face MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport committee for \"pre-appointment scrutiny\", says he will work with clubs and supporters to create a \"dynamic framework\" for English football.",
      "\"Our professional clubs, whatever their size, are a source of local and national pride,\" said Kogan.",
      "\"They generate economic growth and investment, unite communities, and create shared experiences and memories that transcend generations.",
      "\"The job of the regulator is to work with those clubs, their owners, and their supporters to create a dynamic framework that will ensure the game is on a sound financial footing so that it can continue to flourish and to grow. I cannot wait to get started.\"",
      "The Football Governance Bill, which is currently passing through Parliament after being reintroduced by the Labour government in October, will establish a first independent regulator for the professional men's game in England.",
      "The legislation will hand power to a body independent from government and football authorities to oversee clubs in England's top five divisions.",
      "A former BBC journalist and a director of the Women's Sports Group, Kogan helped negotiate a rights deal for the Women's Super League and Women's Championship last year.",
      "If he is handed one of the most powerful roles in the English game, Kogan will be tasked with resolving a long-running disagreement between the Premier League and the EFL over controversial parachute payments to relegated clubs and financial redistribution.",
      "It may therefore concern the EFL that he was the Premier League's media rights advisor from 1998 to 2015. He also has close links to the Labour party, having written two books about them, and having made a number of donations to the party's candidates.",
      "English Football League chairman Rick Parry has been an advocate for an independent regulator, but the Premier League fears it could impact on competitiveness and investment.",
      "A source close to Kogan told the BBC that the previous Conservative government first approached him about the regulator role.",

    "summary": "Supported housing for vulnerable or disabled people is in crisis, a letter to the prime minister says.",
    "story": [
      "Supported housing, which helps vulnerable or disabled people live independently, is in crisis, an open letter signed by more than 170 organisations in the sector claims.",
      "Services at one in three providers in England had to shut last year, adding to a total shortfall of about 325,000 places, says the letter, which will be delivered to Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. Signatories to it include Refuge, Age UK and the National Housing Federation (NHF).",
      "Blaming cuts to council funding and rising costs, the NHF says a further one in three providers fear they may close unless the government pledges more money.",
      "The government says supported housing is vital and it is focused on building more homes.",
      "About half a million people in the UK currently live in supported housing, including young care leavers, army veterans, people with learning disabilities and those escaping homelessness or domestic abuse.",
      "\"Supported housing plays an indispensable role in cutting NHS waiting list backlogs, and reducing pressure on social care, temporary accommodation, and other vital public services,\" the open letter says.",
      "However, it says the future of supported housing is now at risk following \"years of funding cuts\" and that local authorities have now been forced to \"decommission vital services\".",
      "\"Rising costs alongside reduced funding have rendered many services unviable, forcing many to close, while demand for supported housing continues to rise. The decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has placed even further pressure on providers' budgets.\"",
      "The organisations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support of at least \u00a31.6bn per year for councils and for supported homes to be among the 1.5 million new houses planned by the government.",
      "\"We recognise the vital role played by supported housing in helping vulnerable people to live independently and well, and the contribution it makes to tackling rough sleeping and timely hospital discharge,\" a spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said.",
      "The spokesperson said the government was putting \u00a32bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27, with further details to be set out in a long-term housing strategy later this year.",
      "Proponents of austerity measures say tough funding choices need to be made to balance the UK's finances.",
      "However, Shaoxiong Liu says his family do not know what they would have done without a supported housing place for his son Jason.",
      "Aged 39, Jason has autism, a learning disability and mental health challenges. As he grew older, this became increasingly unmanageable for his family. After falling ill, Jason was admitted to hospital with sepsis in 2017.",
      "Due to his challenging behaviour and a condition that induces severe vomiting, he remained in hospital for months as they struggled to find somewhere long term that could accommodate his needs.",
      "He was eventually placed with Advance Housing, where his family says Jason has flourished in the intervening eight years. His weight has risen from 35kg to 53kg, he can go on bus trips and attends social events organised by the housing provider.",
      "\"Jason's behaviour is so much better now. He's lived there so long and he's happy there,\" Mr Liu says. \"Jason is an adult now and we are in our 70s, so his behaviour could be quite dangerous for us if he lived with us - we couldn't look after him.\"",
      "The NHF says one in three providers in England it surveyed say they may have to stop providing services altogether, meaning the loss of 70,000 supported homes across the country.",
      "In 2009, ringfenced council funding for housing-related support was removed. When council budgets were cut during austerity from 2010, funding was needed in other areas, meaning some councils had to cut supported housing services.",
      "The NHF says that means there are now fewer supported homes than in 2007, including a net loss of 3,000 supported homes in the last three years. It calculates there is a total shortfall of up to 325,000 supported homes, based on unmet need.",

    "story": [
      "Energy secretary Ed Miliband is \"considering\" plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy.",
      "He did not set out details of the \"zonal pricing\" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment.",
      "But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households.",
      "Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills.",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Could Scotland have Europe's lowest electricity bills?",
      "GB Energy to be blocked from using slavery-linked solar",
      "According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.",
      "If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.",
      "Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland rather than households in the South.",
      "The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.",
      "Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed.",
      "But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that zonal pricing was a \"terrible idea\" as \"tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now\".",
      "Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted \"absolutely no decision has been made\".",
      "\"This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing.",
      "\"Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country.",
      "\"We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision.\"",
      "Can I fix my energy prices?",
      "The Liberal Democrats warned against regional pricing saying the \"government has got to ensure that reforms to electricity pricing ultimately bring down customers' bills and create a fairer system - across the board.\"",
      "The party's energy and net zero spokesperson, Pippa Heylings, said: \"In a cost-of-living crisis and when energy giants have been raking it in - energy bills should be going down not up.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans \"a form of bribery\", saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects \"ruining\" the local area.",
      "\"None of this I think has been fully thought through,\" he argued.",
      "\"I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences.\"",
      "The Green Party of England and Wales have also called on the government to reject regional pricing.",
      "Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the BBC: \"People live in poverty all over the country - penalising families struggling to pay their bills because of where they happen to live would be wrong.\"",
      "The Conservatives have also been approached for comment."

      "\"Whether you're heading to work, taking your kids to school, or simply trying to enjoy a moment of peace, everyone deserves to feel safe and respected on public transport.\"",
      "She added: \"It's time to take a stand for the quiet majority who just want to get from A to B in peace.\"",
      "Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Playing loud music on public transport may seem like a small thing, but it speaks towards a growing tolerance of anti-social behaviour that chips away at public civility.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkep1vx3mro",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:15:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to reduce energy bills by using more renewables, but bills are currently rising.",
    "story": [
      "Energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family in April, following an announcement from the regulator Ofgem.",
      "But Labour pledged in its manifesto: \"We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good.\" It also promised bills would come down by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\".",
      "Responding to the 6% price cap rise, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was due to \"our reliance on the fossil fuel markets\" and added: \"We're acting to bring down bills for everyone with our mission for clean, home-grown power that we control.\"",
      "The government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030.",
      "More power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper electricity bills?",
      "There are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays, and the way the electricity market is set up.",
      "People should consider energy bill fix, regulator says",
      "Is Labour's 2030 green energy goal realistic and how would it affect bills?",
      "How do UK prices compare with other countries?",
      "The UK's electricity is expensive.",
      "Compared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.",
      "This is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.",
      "For industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period.",
      "The UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.",
      "The largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the \"wholesale\" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.",
      "Other parts of the bill include \"network\" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and \"policy\" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.",
      "The main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.",
      "How is the price set?",
      "The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.",
      "Once built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.",
      "Gas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a \"carbon price\" - a charge for emissions.",
      "The wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.",
      "In Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.",
      "\"The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,\" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.",
      "How cheap is renewable energy?",
      "Renewables can generate electricity cheaply.",
      "But building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.",
      "The government needs to triple wind and solar capacity. To get developers to deliver this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.",
      "It does that by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity generated for 15 years into the future.",
      "If the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company. If the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.",
      "Any costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.",
      "Strike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.",
      "As more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.",
      "\"There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,\" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.",
      "\"The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.\"",
      "What about extra costs?",
      "The UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.",
      "This adds to the network costs in a bill.",
      "Intermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.",
      "Great Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.",
      "Some analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.",
      "What is being done?",
      "The government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear.",
      "In the long term, renewables \"will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,\" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.",
      "But savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly.",
      "Some analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive \"strike prices\", locking in higher costs.",
      "\"If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further\u2026 but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],\" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.",
      "\"That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.\"",
      "But a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.",
      "The government said earlier in February that its plans would \"bring down bills for households and businesses for good\" and lowering them by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\" remains an objective.",

      "One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these.",
      "Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.",
      "The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal.",
      "President Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US \u2013 including from the UK.",

      "\"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added.",
      "Reeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\".",
      "\"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said.",

      "The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.",
      "Farmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\".",
      "He said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

    "story": [
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",

    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

      "Instead they are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system to build consumer trust.",
      "The recommendation is part of a submission made to the UK government's independent review into the water sector.",
      "Campaigners have long complained the companies' self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution in UK water being revealed.",

      "England water pollution at 10-year high, campaigners say",
      "Government has broken the law on sewage, says watchdog",
      "A report from the National Audit Office examining the three water regulators (Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate) and Defra, is expected on Friday.",
      "David Henderson, CEO of industry body Water UK, told the BBC: \"We absolutely accept that self-monitoring is not helping to instil trust and so we would like to see an end to it, and in place of it a more robust, third-party system.\"",
      "As part of their permitting arrangements water companies are expected to regularly sample water quality to identify potential pollution, and submit this data to the Environment Agency in an arrangement known as \"operator self monitoring\".",
      "But there have been incidents of misreporting by water companies in England and Wales uncovered by the regulators, who said some cases had been deliberate.",
      "Southern Water was previously issued fines totalling \u00a3213m by the industry regulator (Ofwat) and the environmental regulator (the Environment Agency) for manipulating sewage data.",
      "In that case, there was unreported pollution into numerous conservation sites which caused \"major environmental harm\" to wildlife.",
      "The company later admitted its actions \"fell short\".",
      "Henderson added that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to \"reduce the administrative burden\" on the Environment Agency (EA).",
      "In 2023, the BBC reported that EA staff were concerned that, due to funding cuts, the Agency was increasingly relying on water companies to self-report rather than carrying out its own checks on pollution from sewage.",
      "The current environment minister, Steve Reed, has promised to review the system, calling it the equivalent of companies \"mark[ing] their own homework\".",
      "But the National Audit Office (NAO), which reviews government spending, questioned the ability of regulators, like the EA, to take on any new monitoring.",
      "\"Regulators need to address the fact that they currently have limited oversight over whether water companies are carrying out their work as expected. It is hard to see how they will achieve this without increased overall capacity,\" said Anita Shah, NAO Director of Regulation.",
      "It is expected to publish a full review of the regulation of the water sector on Friday.",
      "A Defra spokesperson told the BBC: \"We are committed to taking decisive action to fix the water industry. The Water Commission's recommendations will mark the next major step [to] restore public trust in the sector.\"",
      "The government launched an independent water commission in October to review the sector and the way it is regulated. The public consultation closed on Wednesday with the findings expected in July.",
      "Water UK submitted a 200-page document of recommendations, including this call to end self-monitoring.",
      "The industry body also requested that water meters be universal across England and Wales to make bills fairer. At present about 60% of the population have a meter.",
      "\"The meter is just to ensure that people are paying for what they use as opposed to a flat rate of system where you can use virtually no water and pay the same as someone filling up a pool three times in a summer,\" said Henderson.",

    "story": [
      "Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say.",
      "The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery.",
      "Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion.",
      "Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first \"physical evidence\" of gladiators fighting big cats.",
      "\"For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,\" he said.",
      "\"This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.\"",
      "Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis.",
      "Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: \"We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death.",
      "\"So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.\"",
      "As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo.",
      "\"The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,\" Prof Thompson told BBC News.",
      "The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death.",
      "The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, \"is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.\"",
      "The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones.",
      "Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts.",
      "Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had \"never seen anything like these bite marks\".",
      "Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a \"short and somewhat brutal life\".",
      "His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat.",
      "Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: \"This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.\"",
      "The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the \"presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death\", she said.",
      "Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.",
      "The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.",
      "David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: \"We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.\""

      "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.",
      "A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.",
      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".",
      "Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.",
      "Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.",
      "The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.",
      "Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",
      "\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"",
      "A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",
      "That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.",
      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.",
      "\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.",
      "\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"",
      "Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.",
      "We tasted the steaming dumplings together.",
      "My view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"",
      "Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,\" she beamed.",
      "\"I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.\"",
      "Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.",
      "Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.",
      "\"Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,\" she told me.",

      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",

    "story": [
      "Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion.",
      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",
      "\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.",
      "She's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.",
      "In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.",
      "She believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.",
      "\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.",
      "But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.",
      "The couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.",
      "\"Actually we wanted to get married by a volcano,\" Tom says, his bride Kristina by his side."

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

    "story": [
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",

    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

      "The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.",
      "Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.",
      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",
      "Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.",
      "As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.",
      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "\"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.",
      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",
      "The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.",
      "\"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.",
      "\"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.",
      "He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues.",
      "Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.",
      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",
      "\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.",
      "\"The pipelines are a national security problem for us.\"",
      "That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.",
      "A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.",
      "In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\",  though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines, knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.",
      "He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.",
      "The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  \u00a34.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.",
      "And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.",
      "Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a \"denial situation about climate change\".",
      "\"I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales\" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.",
      "Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.",
      "As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.",

      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",
      "Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.",
      "Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.",
      "The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.",
      "Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.",
      "The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.",
      "Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.",
      "\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.",
      "\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"",
      "The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.",
      "Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.",
      "\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.",
      "\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge and charged her with obstruction for allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.",
      "Announcing her arrest, FBI director Kash Patel accused Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan of \"intentionally misdirecting\" immigration agents away from a Mexican man they were trying to arrest last week.",
      "\"Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's been in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "During a preliminary court hearing on Friday, Dugan's lawyer said she \"wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety\".",
      "The judge has been charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to avoid arrest, and faces a maximum of six years in prison if convicted on both charges.",
      "Dugan was released on her own recognisance pending a hearing on 15 May.",
      "The charges stem from events that played out in Dugan's courtroom last week.",
      "On 17 April, an immigration judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national facing three misdemeanour battery counts stemming from a domestic fight, according to court documents filed in the case by the FBI.",
      "The following day, Flores-Ruiz appeared in the Milwaukee court for a scheduled hearing, and six officers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency arrived at the courthouse to make the arrest.",
      "The agents identified themselves to court officials and waited outside Dugan's courtroom, but according to the FBI affidavit, the judge became \"visibly angry, commented that the situation was 'absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers\" when she learned of their presence.",
      "In the hallway outside the court, Dugan and the unnamed agents then argued over the type of arrest warrant that had been issued, before the judge instructed them to report to the office of the county's chief judge.",
      "While several agents were in the office, affidavit says, the judge ushered Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer to a side door meant for jury members leading out of the courtroom.",
      "But two agents remained near the courtroom and spotted Flores-Ruiz attempting to escape, the affidavit says.",
      "Flores-Ruiz, who authorities say had previously been deported from the US in 2013, managed to exit the courthouse but was arrested just minutes later after a short foot chase.",
      "Dugan's arrest came one day after a former judge in New Mexico was taken into custody accused of harbouring an alleged Venezuelan gang member in his home.",
      "\"I think some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law and they are not,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in an interview on Friday.",
      "\"And if you are destroying evidence, if you are obstructing justice, when you have victims sitting in a courtroom of domestic violence, and you're escorting a criminal defendant out a back door, it will not be tolerated.\"",
      "Reaction to the arrest largely split along partisan lines.",
      "Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, called it a \"gravely serious and drastic move\".",
      "\"Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line.\"",
      "Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson also criticised the arrest, calling it \"showboating\" and warned that it would have a \"chilling effect\" on court proceedings.",
      "Wisconsin's Republican US Senator, Ron Johnson, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"I would advise everyone to cooperate with federal law enforcement and not endanger them and the public by obstructing their efforts to arrest criminals and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Dugan was first elected as a judge in 2016, and was re-elected to a second six-year term in 2022.",
      "Judicial elections in Wisconsin are non-partisan, however Dugan was endorsed by Milwaukee's Democratic mayor.",
      "The obstruction charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, while the concealment charges can be punished by up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.",
      "In 2019, during the first Trump administration, a judge in Massachusetts was arrested after she allowed an undocumented immigrant defendant to retrieve property from a lockup in the courtroom. The immigrant then left the courtroom.",
      "Judge Shelley M Richmond Joseph was charged with obstruction, but the charges were dropped in 2022, although she still faces an ongoing ethics complaint stemming from the incident."

      "The report concluded: \"Ownership was not properly established, no policies and procedures were established regarding the renovation and insufficient action was taken when the artworks turned out to be missing.\"",
      "It went on to say that a lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation and security of the artworks, were also contributing factors.",
      "Local media reports that the 46 artworks altogether were worth around \u20ac22,000 (\u00a318,800) and the Maashorst municipality said it was unlikely they will ever be found.",

      "Warhol, considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, created the prints in 1985 - two years before his death.",
      "In November last year, Warhol prints of Queen Beatrix and Ntombi Twala were stolen - and abandoned - during a heist on a Dutch art gallery.",
      "Local police at the time said thieves took four silkscreen prints from the MPV Gallery in the North Brabant province and fled by car.",

      "The office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered its condolences for Pope Francis, four days after his death.",
      "An earlier offer of condolences posted on social media by the official state account of Israel had previously been deleted, causing considerable controversy within the country.",
      "Israel is also sending a relatively low-level delegation to the late pontiff's funeral on Saturday, with only the country's Vatican ambassador in attendance.",
      "All of this has been seen in Israel and elsewhere as a sign of the Israeli government's displeasure with Pope Francis's impassioned remarks on the war in Gaza.",
      "Who is going to the Pope's funeral?",
      "We're orphans now, say Gaza Catholics the Pope called daily",
      "Belatedly and somewhat impersonally, the Israeli prime minister's office issued a two sentence offer of condolences on Thursday night.",
      "It read: \"The State of Israel expresses its deepest condolences to the Catholic Church and the Catholic community worldwide at the passing of Pope Francis. May he rest in peace.\"",
      "The tone of the original message tweeted by the verified @Israel account on X on the day of the Pope's death was noticeably warmer.",
      "It featured a photo of Pope Francis at the Western Wall in Jerusalem and concluded: \"May his memory be a blessing.\"",
      "But it was swiftly withdrawn, without explanation.",
      "Several Israeli media outlets reported on it being deleted, with the Jerusalem Post quoting officials at the foreign ministry saying that it had been posted in \"error\".",
      "The Jerusalem Post also quoted Israel's former ambassador to the Vatican, Raphael Schutz, describing the decision to delete the published statement as a mistake.",
      "In the face of such criticism, Israeli officials did point out that the country's current ambassador to the Vatican had offered his condolences in person.",
      "And it is the ambassador, Yaron Sideman, who will represent Israel at the funeral of Pope Francis.",
      "This is in marked contrast to the heads of state or government who will be attending from most major nations, including US President Donald Trump.",
      "It is also very different from the funeral of the last pope to die while still in office - that of John Paul II in 2005. Israel sent the then-president, Moshe Katsav, and the then-foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to attend the ceremony.",
      "The current Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, did publish an eloquent and heartfelt tribute to Pope Francis in the hours after his death, describing him as a man of deep faith and boundless compassion.",
      "But there appear to be no plans for him to attend the funeral. No reason has been given, although it may have something to do with the funeral taking place on Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath.",
      "But it seems clear that the Israeli government's resentment of Pope Francis's expressions of solidarity with the Palestinians, especially during the war in Gaza, has soured its response to his death.",
      "Last November, Pope Francis suggested that the international community should examine whether Israel's military offensive in Gaza should be classed as genocide \u2013 an allegation Israel has vehemently denied.",
      "Earlier this year, he called the humanitarian situation in Gaza \"shameful\".",
      "In his very last public address on Easter Sunday - the day before his death - there was mention of Gaza once again. His address spoke of the suffering of both the Palestinians and the Israelis.",
      "Since his death, more details have emerged of how Pope Francis would be in contact almost daily with the small Christian community sheltering in a church in Gaza City during the war.",
      "Palestinians have spoken warmly of how much his expressions of empathy had given them hope.",
      "As a sign of how highly they respected the Pope, the Palestinian Authority is sending Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa to the funeral.",
      "All this has meant that some in Israel, especially among the coalition of religious and nationalist parties that buoy up Netanyahu's coalition, believe that Pope Francis had taken the side of the Palestinians, despite his expressions of sympathy for Israelis and his efforts at bolstering multi-faith dialogue.",
      "That sense of a rift between the current Israeli government and the Vatican may well be visible at the Pope's funeral in Rome, where Israel's leaders will be noticeable by their absence."

    "summary": "After a deadly militant attack in Kashmir, India suspended a key water treaty with neighbouring Pakistan.",
    "story": [
      "Will India be able to stop the Indus river and two of its tributaries from flowing into Pakistan?",
      "That's the question on many minds, after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday's horrific attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management.",
      "The suspension is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism -  a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi, and said stopping water flow \"will be considered as an Act of War\".",
      "The treaty allocated the three eastern rivers \u2013 the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej \u2013 of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones \u2013 the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab \u2013 to Pakistan.",
      "Disputes have flared in the past, with Pakistan objecting to some of India's hydropower and water infrastructure projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. (More than 80% of Pakistan's agriculture and around a third of its hydropower depend on the Indus basin's water.)",
      "India, meanwhile, has been pushing to review and modify the treaty, citing changing needs - from irrigation and drinking water to hydropower - in light of factors like climate change.",
      "Over the years, Pakistan and India have pursued competing legal avenues under the treaty brokered by the World Bank.",
      "But this is the first time either side has announced a suspension - and notably, it's the upstream country, India, giving it a geographic advantage.",
      "But what does the suspension really mean? Could India hold back or divert the Indus basin's waters, depriving Pakistan of its lifeline? And is it even capable of doing so?",
      "Experts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes.",
      "\"The infrastructure India has are mostly run-of-the-river hydropower plants that do not need massive storage,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, a regional water resources expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.",
      "Such hydropower plants use the force of running water to spin turbines and generate electricity, without holding back large volumes of water.",
      "Indian experts say inadequate infrastructure has kept India from fully utilising even its 20% share of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus waters under the treaty - a key reason they argue for building storage structures, which Pakistan opposes citing treaty provisions.",
      "Experts say India can now modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan.",
      "\"Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan,\" said Mr Thakkar.",
      "But challenges like difficult terrain and protests within India itself over some of its projects have meant that construction of water infrastructure in the Indus basin has not moved fast enough.",
      "After a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016, Indian water resources ministry officials had told the BBC they would speed up construction of several dams and water storage projects in the Indus basin.",
      "Although there is no official information on the status of such projects, sources say progress has been limited.",
      "Some experts say that if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest.",
      "\"A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season - when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical,\" Hassan F Khan, assistant professor of Urban Environmental Policy and Environmental Studies at Tufts University, wrote in the Dawn newspaper.",
      "\"That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.\"",
      "The treaty requires India to share hydrological data with Pakistan - crucial for flood forecasting and planning for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.",
      "Pradeep Kumar Saxena, India's former IWT commissioner for over six years, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the country can now stop sharing flood data with Pakistan.",
      "The region sees damaging floods during the monsoon season, which begins in June and lasts until September. But Pakistani authorities have said India was already sharing very limited hydrological data.",
      "\"India was sharing only around 40% of the data even before it made the latest announcement,\" Shiraz Memon, Pakistan's former additional commissioner of the Indus Waters Treaty, told BBC Urdu.",
      "Another issue that comes up each time there is water-related tension in the region is if the upstream country can \"weaponise\" water against the downstream country.",
      "This is often called a \"water bomb\", where the upstream country can temporarily hold back water and then release it suddenly, without warning, causing massive damage downstream.",
      "Could India do that?",
      "Experts say India would first risk flooding its own territory as its dams are far from the Pakistan border. However, it could now flush silt from its reservoirs without prior warning - potentially causing damage downstream in Pakistan.",
      "How water shortages are brewing wars",
      "How water shortages are brewing wars",
      "Himalayan rivers like the Indus carry high silt levels, which quickly accumulate in dams and barrages. Sudden flushing of this silt can cause significant downstream damage.",
      "There's a bigger picture: India is downstream of China in the Brahmaputra basin, and the Indus originates in Tibet.",
      "In 2016, after India warned that \"blood and water cannot flow together\" following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which India blamed on Pakistan, China blocked a tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo - that becomes the Brahmaputra in northeast India.",
      "China, that has Pakistan as its ally, said they had done it as it was needed for a hydropower project they were building near the border. But the timing of the move was seen as Beijing coming in to help Islamabad.",
      "After building several hydropower plants in Tibet, China has green-lit what will be the world's largest dam on the lower reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo.",
      "Beijing claims minimal environmental impact, but India fears it could give China significant control over the river's flow."

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office.",
      "\"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April.",
      "Doge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce.",
      "BBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.",
      "Our analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up.",
      "How does Doge report savings?",
      "In October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from \"cutting fraud and waste\" by the end of the next financial year in 2026.",
      "The US federal budget for the last financial year was $6.75tn.",
      "Doge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.",
      "However, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings.",
      "We downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases.",
      "Our analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence.",
      "US media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract which in fact had a total value of $8m.",
      "Doge says it is working to upload all receipts in a \"digestible and transparent manner\" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts \"representing around 30% of all total savings\". It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\".",
      "What's the evidence behind the biggest saving?",
      "BBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached.",
      "The department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated.",
      "For three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government.",
      "The documents show a contract's start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent.",
      "David Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution.",
      "\"FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,\" he says.",
      "\"For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that's going to cost - so when a price is set, it's not a definite price but rather an upper limit.\"",
      "So if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending.",
      "Doge's largest listed individual saving is $2.9bn.",
      "It comes from cancelling a contract - which started in 2023 under President Biden - for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children.",
      "Doge appears to have taken the \"total contract value\" until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2.9bn figure.",
      "But the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed.",
      "A source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge's figure is \"based on speculative, never-used figures\" and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required.",
      "\"In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount. The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million\", they estimated.",
      "They say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review.",
      "They also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement  - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased.",
      "We contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back.",
      "What about the other big savings?",
      "The second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1.9bn.",
      "The document which Doge links to has a total contract value of $1.9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0.",
      "However, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract.",
      "He said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion.",
      "Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plungeWill Elon Musk be able to cut $2 trillion from US government spending?",
      "Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plunge",
      "Will Elon Musk be able to cut $2 trillion from US government spending?",
      "The contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031.",
      "However, Centennial Technologies' CEO told the New York Times that the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration.",
      "The company did not respond to our requests for further comment.",
      "Another IT contract, this time with the Department of Defense, is the third largest claimed saving.",
      "Doge says $1.76bn was saved by cancelling a contract with an IT services company called A1FEDIMPACT.",
      "On the contract document, the total value is listed as $2.4bn. An online database of government contracts called Higher Gov says this amount was the ceiling value.",
      "Again, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated.",
      "It is unclear where Doge's figure of $1.76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it.",
      "The fourth largest claimed saving of $1.75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines.",
      "Doge links to a page on USASpending.gov. It shows a grant was paid to Gavi in three instalments, during the Biden administration, totalling $880m.",
      "Gavi confirmed that $880m had been paid out by USAID but said it had not been told the grant had been terminated.",
      "\"Gavi has not received a termination notice related to this grant,\" a spokesperson told us.",
      "We have not found any evidence for the $1.75bn saving claimed by Doge, and a source familiar with the contract said it was unclear where it comes from.",
      "We asked the USAID Office of Inspector General about the grant but it did not respond to us.",
      "While Doge may have cut a significant amount of government spending, the lack of evidence provided for its biggest claimed savings makes it impossible to independently confirm exactly how much.",
      "Doge does not have a press office but BBC Verify has contacted the White House to ask for more evidence of these claimed savings.",
      "Additional reporting by Ned Davies and Alison Benjamin.",

      "Before then, in Rome these in-between days have taken on a flavour of their own.",
      "Elena, a Romanian woman in her 50s, said she had noticed a \"pensive\" atmosphere in the city. \"There are big crowds around but I have felt everything was a bit quieter, there is something different in the air,\" she told the BBC, guessing that the Pope's death was encouraging people to \"look inside\" more.",
      "She added that everyone she spoke to this week \u2013 even non-believers \u2013 had been marked by his death somehow.",
      "Her friend Lina agreed. She was standing behind the counter of her tobacconist shop in Borgo Pio, a quiet cobblestoned street lined with buildings in earthy tones and flower boxes near the Vatican. \"It's neither a week of tragedy nor one of celebration,\" she said. \"It's a chance for people to think, to reflect, and I think that's much needed.\"",
      "Nearby, people slowly ambled down Via della Conciliazione \u2013 the pedestrian street that connects Italy and the Vatican city state, and the same one the Pope's coffin will travel down on Saturday as he reaches his final place of rest in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.",
      "The 4th Century church is only located around 4km away from St Peter's, but the journey there is set to take around two hours as the car carrying the Pope's coffin will move at walking pace to allow people lining the streets to see it and say their goodbyes, the Vatican said earlier this week.",

      "Security operation in full swing",
      "Still, the signs of the huge security operation mounted by the Vatican and Italian authorities were everywhere.",
      "On Wednesday, a soldier stood outside a religious goods shop brandishing a hefty bazooka-like anti-drone device. Asked whether the contraption could, for instance, disrupt drone frequencies and force them to return to their bases, he replied mysteriously: \"Maybe, among other things.\"",
      "Next to him, a fellow soldier scanned the sky with binoculars. On the day of the funeral, they will be joined by thousands of security personnel from various branches of the police and armed forces, as well as river patrol units, bomb-sniffing dogs and rooftop snipers.",
      "American student Caislyn, who was sat on a bench sketching the dome of St Peter's, said she was \"shocked\" at how safe she felt despite the number of people around.",
      "The 21-year-old attributed that to the fact that \"people are here to pay their respects to Francis, and to enjoy this beautiful city.\" She called the atmosphere \"bittersweet,\" but said she saw the funeral as a \"celebration of life\".",

      "\"Near that Queen of Peace, to whom I have always turned for help and whose embrace I have sought more than a hundred times during my pontificate,\" he explained in his will.",

    "story": [
      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",
      "\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.",
      "\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said.",
      "At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.",
      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",
      "Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.",
      "For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.",
      "So how can US and European robot makers compete with that?",
      "Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.",

      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",
      "The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.",
      "So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.",
      "\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.",

    "summary": "The mineral, once widely-used, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and cause cancer.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's destructive military campaign in Gaza has released a silent killer: asbestos.",
      "The mineral, once widely-used in building materials, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer.",
      "Nowadays, its use is banned across much of the world, but it is still present in many older buildings.",
      "In Gaza, it is found primarily in asbestos roofing used across the territory's eight urban refugee camps - which were set up for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war - according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).",
      "In October 2024, UNEP estimated that up to 2.3 million tons of rubble across Gaza could be contaminated with asbestos.",
      "\"The Gaza rubble is a very, very toxic environment,\" says Professor Bill Cookson, director of the National Centre for Mesothelioma Research in London. \"People are going to suffer acutely, but also in the longer term as well, things that children may carry throughout their lives.\"",
      "\"The lives lost now are not going to end here. The legacy is going to continue,\" says Liz Darlison, CEO of Mesothelioma UK.",
      "When asbestos is disturbed by something like an air strike, its fibres - too small to see with the human eye - can be breathed in by those nearby and can then work their way through to the lining of the lungs.",
      "Over many years - usually decades - they can cause scarring which leads to a serious lung condition known as asbestosis, or, in some cases, an aggressive form of lung-cancer named mesothelioma.",
      "\"Mesothelioma is a terrible, intractable illness,\" says Prof Cookson.",
      "\"The really worrying thing,\" he adds, \"is that it's not dose related. So even small inhalations of asbestos fibre can cause subsequent mesothelioma.",
      "\"It grows within the pleural cavity. It's extremely painful. It's always diagnosed late. And it's pretty well resistant to all treatments.\"",
      "Typically, those who contract mesothelioma do so 20 to 60 years after exposure - meaning it will take decades before the possible impact across the territory is felt. A higher level, or longer period, of exposure is believed to accelerate the progression of the disease.",
      "Dr Ryan Hoy, whose research into dust inhalation was cited by the UNEP, says it is extremely difficult to avoid breathing in asbestos fibres because they are \"really tiny particles that float in the air that can get very, very deep into the lungs.\"",
      "They are even harder to avoid, he says, because Gaza is so \"densely populated\". The territory houses approximately 2.1 million people and is 365 sq km (141 sq miles) - about one quarter of the size of London.",
      "Gaza in maps: How 15 months of war have drastically changed the territory",
      "Gaza war death toll could be significantly higher, researchers say",
      "Experts on the ground there say people are unable to manage the risks posed by asbestos or dust inhalation due to the more immediate dangers of Israel's military offensive.",
      "\"At this point in time, [dust inhalation] is not something that is perceived as a worrying thing by the population. They even don't have things to eat, and they're more afraid to be killed by the bombs,\" says Chiara Lodi, medical co-ordinator in Gaza for the NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.",
      "\"The lack of awareness about the risks of asbestos, combined with the ongoing challenges [people in Gaza] face in trying to rebuild their lives, means they are unable to take the necessary measures to protect themselves,\" a Gaza-based spokesperson for the NGO SOS Children's Villages said.",
      "Many are \"not fully aware of the harmful effects of the dust and debris\", they added.",
      "After a previous conflict in Gaza in 2009, a UN survey of the territory found asbestos in debris from older buildings, sheds, temporary building extensions, roofs and the walls of livestock enclosures.",
      "There are several types of asbestos ranging from so-called \"white asbestos\", which is the least dangerous, to \"blue\", or crocidolite, which is the most. Highly-carcinogenic crocidolite asbestos was previously found in Gaza by the UN.",
      "Globally, around 68 countries have banned the use of asbestos, though some maintain exemptions for special use. It was banned in the UK in 1999, and Israel banned its use in buildings in 2011.",
      "As well as mesothelioma, asbestos can cause other forms of lung cancer, larynx and ovarian cancer.",
      "A further, lesser known risk is that of silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust, usually over many years. Concrete generally contains 20-60% silica.",
      "Dr Hoy says the sheer amount of dust in Gaza could lead to an \"increased risk of respiratory tract infections, upper and lower airway infections, pneumonia, exacerbations of pre-existing lung disease like asthma,\" as well as, \"emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be worsened by acute exposure to dust\".",
      "For years, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York have been used as a case-study by health experts to examine the effects of a large toxic dust-cloud on a civilian population.",
      "\"The Twin Towers were not in the middle of a war zone,\" says Ms Darlison, \"so it was something we were able to measure and quantify easier\".",
      "As of December 2023, 5,249 of those who were registered with the US government's World Trade Center Health Programme have died as a result of aerodigestive illness or cancer - a far higher figure than the 2,296 people who were killed in the attack itself. A total of 34,113 people were diagnosed with cancer over the same period.",
      "The US and a group of Arab States have proposed competing plans for the reconstruction of Gaza. The UN has warned that the process will have to be managed carefully to avoid disturbing the vast amounts of asbestos-contaminated rubble.",
      "\"Unfortunately,\" says Ms Darlison, \"the very properties that made us use so much of it are the properties that make it difficult to get rid of.\"",
      "A UNEP spokesperson told the BBC that the debris removals process will \"increase the likelihood of asbestos disturbance and the release of hazardous fibres into the air\".",
      "A UNEP assessment indicated that clearing all debris could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2 billion (\u00a3929m).",
      "The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 that killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 people taken hostage.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",

    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

      "It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.",
      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",
      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",

      "PROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin Farrell",
      "VISUAL GUIDE: How the next Pope is chosen by secret vote",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

      "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.",
      "Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".",
      "Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "China can take the pain (to a point)",
      "China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.",
      "With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.",
      "Beijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change.",
      "And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.",
      "The leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.",
      "China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.",
      "Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.",
      "The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.",
      "The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".",
      "President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"",
      "China has been investing in the future",
      "China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.",
      "Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.",
      "It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.",
      "Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.",
      "Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.",
      "US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.",
      "That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.",
      "Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck",
      "Trump's tariffs leave China's neighbours with an impossible choice",
      "Lessons from Trump 1.0",
      "Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.",
      "It has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.",
      "American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.",
      "\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.",
      "The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.",
      "That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.",
      "Following reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".",
      "That would be an impossible choice for much of the world",
      "\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.",
      "China now knows when Trump will blink",
      "Trump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".",
      "But he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.",
      "Trump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "So, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.",
      "China also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.",
      "Some argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".",
      "But experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.",
      "Rather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.",
      "China will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"",
      "A chokehold on rare earths",
      "What China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.",
      "China has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.",
      "Beijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.",
      "China accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "While Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.",
      "In 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.",
      "The fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously.",

    "story": [
      "If the sole predictor of who would become the next pope was where the Catholic Church is growing fastest, then it is almost certain he would hail from Africa.",
      "The continent's Catholic population is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else, representing more than half of the global increase.",
      "While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago, many would argue it is high time for another.",
      "When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making?",
      "\"I think that it will be great to have an African pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation.",
      "But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - \"someone who is already an influential voice\".",
      "\"The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,\" he said.",
      "However, he also said that: \"Cardinal [Robert] Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo [Besungu] of DR Congo have become prominent voices in global Catholicism within the last two years.\"",
      "And he noted that Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson had held different roles at the Vatican, endearing him to many people around the world.",
      "He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center.",
      "\"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilo said.",
      "Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.",
      "For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism.",
      "\"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'\" he told me.",
      "\"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate.",
      "\"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\"",
      "The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\".",
      "\"The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said.",
      "In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican.",
      "He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\".",
      "\"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\"",
      "Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa.",
      "For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers.",
      "His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war.",
      "But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues.",
      "Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.",
      "The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\".",
      "It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries.",
      "The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Sarah and Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue.",
      "Congolese Cardinal Besungu has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\"",
      "And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\".",
      "Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church.",
      "And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa.",
      "\"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said.",
      "\"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.\"",
      "As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised.",
      "It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\".",
      "But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable.",
      "\"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction.",
      "\"I would pray that God will give us a pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:54:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Tundu Lissu has survived against the political odds over the years but has now been charged with treason.",
    "story": [
      "Shot 16 times in an assassination attempt in 2017, Tundu Lissu is the great survivor of Tanzanian politics - and one of its most persecuted politicians.",
      "But some are asking whether he has now reached the the end of the line.",
      "Lissu, the leader of the main opposition party, Chadema, is back in the limelight after being charged with treason - a crime for which the maximum sentence is the death penalty.",
      "Still, he is undeterred. Despite the enormous risk, he believes he can pressure the government to institute reforms, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in October.",
      "But can he weather the storm in a harsh political environment, and against what he believes are politically driven charges?",
      "His party has been disqualified from the elections and he has been in detention for the past two weeks.",
      "In September last year, Lissu told the BBC that nothing would come on a silver platter, and it would take courage to demand reforms \"on the streets and in the villages\".",
      "To achieve his goals, he felt he had to take over Chadema's leadership.",
      "A fiery politician, Lissu was critical of the way the party was being run, accusing then chairman Freeman Mbowe of being too reconciliatory towards the government.",
      "In an intense race, he ousted Mbowe from the post.",
      "After just three months at the helm of Chadema, Lissu was this month arrested and detained for a speech allegedly calling for the public to launch a rebellion and disrupt the elections.",
      "He was not allowed to enter a plea on the treason charge but pleaded not guilty to a separate charge of publishing false information.",
      "Prior to his arrest, he had been holding gatherings across the country with a rallying call of \"no reforms, no elections\".",
      "He said the current system was rigged in favour of the ruling CCM party, adding that without reforms, there was no point in taking part in the elections.",
      "He was due to appear at Kisutu magistrates' court in Dar es Salaam on Thursday. There was tight security around the court and elsewhere in the city.",
      "Chadema said more of party officials, including deputy chairman John Heche and secretary general John Mnyika, were arrested on their way to the court.",
      "The court ordered the case to be heard virtually but Lissu did not appear before it, with the case going on in the presence of his lawyers. The hearing will continue on Monday.",
      "Lissu cannot seek bail because he has been charged with treason.",
      "His international lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, told the BBC that it was their \"mission to defend democracy\".",
      "Yet it is no simple task - CCM has won every election since independence, and is unlikely to easily let go of its stranglehold on power.",
      "There is also a rift in Chadema, with some members disagreeing with Lissu's strategy.",
      "The party is barred from contesting October's election after it refused to comply with the electoral commission's requirement to sign a code of conduct.",
      "The document's key objective \"is to ensure that political parties and their supporters behave well... and maintain peace and harmony\" during the elections.",
      "Chadema sees the code of conduct as a ploy to contain the opposition, and it fears that state repression will continue.",
      "In September a senior Chadema party official was abducted and brutally killed amid a wave of abductions of government critics.",
      "During local elections in November, Chadema said thousands of its candidates were barred from participating. The ruling party won about 98% of the seats.",
      "The government dismissed suggestions that the elections were not free and fair, saying they were held in accordance with the rules.",
      "But for Lissu, the local elections justified his calls for reforms ahead of the presidential and parliamentary polls.",
      "Tanzania's main opposition party banned from electionWhy Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political anger",
      "Tanzania's main opposition party banned from election",
      "Why Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political anger",
      "Campaign group Human Rights Watch has expressed similar fears, and has urged the government to end political repression.",
      "The Catholic Church has added its voice to calls for the unconditional release of Lissu, and for fair elections.",
      "But the arrest of opposition politicians has continued, despite Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa promising earlier this month that the authorities would ensure security and fairness in the polls.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the government for comment.",
      "President Samia Suluhu Hassan gave Tanzanians greater political freedom after she took office following the death in office of her predecessor John Magufuli in 2021.",
      "However, Tanzania was once again \"beginning to see the wave of repression and state-orchestrated violence\" that characterised Magufuli's rule, Tanzanian political analyst Nicodemus Minde said.",
      "It was during that era that Lissu survived an assassination attempt.",
      "Before his arrest, Lissu said his party had a list of \"minimum but critical reforms that must be made to guarantee free elections\".",
      "Mr Amsterdam, his lawyer, told the BBC that this included the formation of \"a truly independent national electoral commission with members unconnected to the government\" - and this must be enshrined in the constitution.",
      "Chadema is also demanding that when there are electoral disputes, the burden of proof should lie with the commission to show that the vote was free and fair.",
      "Lissu's strategy has come at a heavy cost to himself and Chadema, as a faction within the party, known as G-55,  has adopted a softer stance.",
      "It has called for the party to contest the elections while pursuing talks with the government over its demands.",
      "That is the approach taken by the second largest opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo.",
      "Along with 16 fringe opposition parties, it has signed the code of conduct. Only Chadema has refused.",
      "Lissu appears to see neighbouring Kenya - where mass protests last year forced the government to drop plans to increase taxes - as a model to follow.",
      "At the time, he told the BBC that Tanzanians had not \"pressed hard enough for democratic reform\", and what Kenya went through in order to get [its] democratic dispensation is something that we need to do\".",
      "Whether such a strategy would work is unclear, as many Tanzanians appear reluctant to publicly support a campaign that could rattle the government.",
      "But Mr Amsterdam said the more intransigent the government, the more it would spur Chadema's supporters \"to push forward and engage in civil disobedience\".",
      "He added that Chadema would use \"every legal and political tool\" to achieve change.",
      "But political analyst Thomas Kibwana criticised Lissu's strategy, saying that with the term of the current parliament due to end in June there would not be enough time to give legal effect to any major reforms ahead of the October election.",
      "He said it might be better for Chadema to wait until after the election.",
      "Fulgence Massawe, the director of a legal rights organisation in Tanzania, told the BBC that Chadema's push for electoral reforms faced significant hurdles, but the party had the right to go to court to challenge its exclusion from the elections.",
      "Mr Minde said that if Chadema remained shut out of the elections, the ruling party is likely to increase its already overwhelming majority in parliament.",
      "The analyst added that Chadema might even lose its standing as the main opposition party, and \"of course nature pulls back and probably other opposition parties will seize this opportunity\".",
      "It is a risk that Lissu and the party have chosen to take.",

      "After receiving hormone treatment for an illness, Abby's weight increased from 42kg (6 stone 8lbs) to 62kg (9 stone 11lbs) in two months.",
      "The change hadn't gone unnoticed by her drama teacher.",
      "\"My teacher said, 'You were our star but now you're too fat. Either give up or lose weight fast,'\" recalls Abby, who was preparing for her drama exams at the time.",
      "Abby's mother stepped in, taking her to get liposuction to remove fat from her belly and legs.",
      "Abby remembers her mother's words as she waited in the clinic in a hospital gown, nervous about the impending operation.",
      "\"Just be brave and walk in. You'll become pretty once you're out.\"",
      "The surgery was traumatic. Abby was only given partial anaesthesia and remained conscious throughout.",
      "\"I could see how much fat was extracted from my body and how much blood I was losing,\" she says.",
      "Now 35, Abby has gone on to have more than 100 procedures, costing half a million dollars.",
      "She co-owns a beauty clinic in central Beijing and has become one of the most recognisable faces of China's plastic surgery boom.",
      "But the surgeries have come at a physical cost.",
      "Sitting in front of a mirror inside her luxury duplex apartment in Beijing, she gently dabs concealer onto bruises from a recent face-slimming injection - a procedure she undergoes monthly to help her face appear \"firmer and less chubby\" after three jaw reduction surgeries removed too much bone.",
      "But she insists she has no regrets about the surgeries and believes her mother made the right decision all those years ago.",
      "\"The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call.\"",
      "Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media.",
      "Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures.",
      "Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25.",
      "While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing.",
      "For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face.",
      "But lately, more disturbing procedures are on the rise - chasing an unrealistic, hyper-feminine, almost infantile ideal.",
      "Details of help and support with body image concerns are available in the UK at BBC Action Line",
      "Details of help and support with body image concerns are available in the UK at BBC Action Line",
      "Botox is now injected behind the ears to tilt them forward, creating the illusion of a smaller, daintier face.",
      "Lower eyelid surgery, inspired by the glassy gaze of anime heroines, widens the eyes for an innocent, childlike look.",
      "Upper lip shortening narrows the space between lip and nose, thought to signal youth.",
      "But much of this beauty is built for the screen. Under filters and ring lights, the results can look flawless. In real life, the effect is often uncanny - a face not quite human, not quite child.",
      "Cosmetic surgery apps like SoYoung (New Oxygen) and GengMei (More Beautiful) - claiming to offer algorithm-driven analysis of \"facial imperfections\" - have been surging in popularity.",
      "After scanning and assessing users' faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation.",
      "These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what's considered desirable and normal.",
      "As one of China's earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched.",
      "Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung's \"magic mirror\" feature, the app still points out \"imperfections\" and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries.",
      "\"It says I have eye bags. Get a chin augmentation? I've done that.\"",
      "Abby seems amused.",
      "\"Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?\"",
      "Unlike typical e-commerce sites, beauty apps like SoYoung also offer a social media function. Users share detailed before-and-after diaries and often ask superusers like Abby for their advice.",
      "'My skin felt like there was cement underneath'",
      "To meet surging demand, clinics are opening up rapidly across China.",
      "But there's a shortage of qualified practitioners and large numbers of clinics are operating without a licence.",
      "According to a report by iResearch, a marketing research firm, as of 2019, 80,000 venues in China were providing cosmetic procedures without a licence and 100,000 cosmetic practitioners were working without the right qualifications.",
      "As a result, it's estimated that hundreds of accidents are happening every day inside Chinese cosmetic surgery clinics.",
      "Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing.",
      "\"I've seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,\" Dr Yang says.",
      "\"Some even had surgery inside people's homes.\"",
      "Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have had surgery that went badly wrong.",
      "In 2020 she received baby face collagen injections - designed to make the face appear more plump - from an unlicensed clinic opened by a close friend. But the fillers hardened.",
      "\"My skin felt like there was cement underneath,\" she says.",
      "Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse.",
      "One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose.",
      "Another clinic tried lifting the skin near her ears to reach the filler underneath, leaving her with two long scars and a face that looked unnaturally tight.",
      "\"My entire image collapsed. I lost my shine and it's affected my work [in human resources for a foreign company in Shanghai] too.\"",
      "She found Dr Yang through SoYoung last year and has since undergone three repair surgeries, including for her eyelids which were damaged during a previous operation by another clinic.",
      "But while Dr Yang's surgeries have brought visible improvements, some of the damage from the botched procedures may be permanent.",
      "\"I don't want to become prettier any more,\" she says.",
      "\"If I could go back to how I looked before surgery, I'd be quite happy.\"",
      "'It ruined my career'",
      "Every year, tens of thousands like Yue Yue fall victim to unlicensed cosmetic clinics in China.",
      "But even some licensed clinics and qualified surgeons aren't following the rules strictly.",
      "In 2020, actress Gao Liu's botched nose operation - in which the tip of her nose turned black and died - went viral.",
      "\"My face was disfigured and I was very down. It ruined my acting career.\"",
      "She had received the nose surgery at a licensed Guangzhou clinic called She's Times from Dr He Ming, who was described as its \"chief surgeon\" and a nose surgery expert.",
      "But in reality Dr He was not fully qualified to perform the surgery without supervision and had not obtained his licensed plastic surgeon status from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission.",
      "Authorities fined the clinic, which closed soon after the scandal, and barred Dr He from practising for six months.",
      "However, weeks before She's Times was officially dissolved, a new clinic, Qingya, requested to register at the same address.",
      "BBC Eye has found strong links between She's Times and Qingya, such as the same Weibo account and the retention of several staff, including Dr He.",
      "The BBC has also learned that Dr He only obtained the licensed plastic surgeon qualification in April 2024, even though he was technically barred from applying for the status for five years from the date he was sanctioned in 2021.",
      "Qingya now claims to have opened 30 branches.",
      "Dr He, Qingya and Guangdong Provincial Health Commission did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.",
      "The\u00a0Chinese\u00a0Embassy\u00a0in the UK said: \"The\u00a0Chinese\u00a0government consistently requires enterprises to operate in strict compliance with national laws, regulations, and relevant policy provisions.\"",
      "Four years and two repair operations later, Gao Liu's nose remains uneven.",
      "\"I really regret it. Why did I do it?\"",
      "China's Central Health Commission has been trying to crack down on the issue of under-qualified health practitioners performing tasks beyond their expertise in recent years - including ordering local health bodies to improve regulation and issuing stricter guidelines - but problems persist.",
      "From job offer to debt and surgery - within 24 hours",
      "In today's China, looking good is important for professional success.",
      "A quick search on popular job recruitment platforms reveals many examples of employers listing physical requirements for roles, even when they have little to do with the actual work.",
      "One receptionist role asks for candidates to be \"at least 160cm tall and aesthetically pleasing\", while an administrative job demands \"an appealing look and an elegant presence\".",
      "And now that pressure is being exploited by a growing scam in some Chinese clinics in which vulnerable young women are offered jobs, but only if they pay for expensive surgeries carried out by their would-be employers.",
      "Da Lan, not her real name, applied for a \"beauty consultant\" job at a clinic in Chengdu, south-western China, on a popular recruitment website in March 2024.",
      "After the interview, she was offered the position that same evening.",
      "But she says when she began her role the next morning, she was taken to a small room by her manager, who scanned her up and down and gave her an ultimatum - get cosmetic work done or lose out on the job.",
      "Da Lan says she was given less than an hour to decide.",
      "Under pressure, she agreed to undergo double eyelid surgery - priced at over 13,000 yuan (\u00a31,330) - more than three times the monthly salary of the role - with more than 30% annual interest.",
      "She says staff took her phone and used it to apply for a so-called \"beauty loan,\" falsifying her income details. Within a minute, the loan was approved.",
      "By noon, she was undergoing medical tests. An hour later, she was on the operating table.",
      "From job offer to debt and surgery - all within 24 hours.",
      "You can watch the documentary on BBC Two at 23:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April.",
      "Outside of the UK, you can watch the documentary on YouTube.",
      "The surgery did nothing for her job prospects. Da Lan says her manager belittled her, shouting her name in public and swearing at her.",
      "She quit after just a few weeks. Looking back, she believes the job was never real.",
      "\"They wanted me to leave from the beginning,\" she says.",
      "Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months.",
      "BBC Eye spoke to dozens of victims, and met three including Da Lan in Chengdu, a city that has set out to become China's \"capital of cosmetic surgery\". Some have been trapped in much larger debt for years.",
      "The clinic Da Lan says scammed her had previously been reported by other graduates and exposed by local media, but it remains open and is still recruiting for the same role.",
      "This scam isn't limited to clinic jobs - it's creeping into other industries.",
      "Some live-streaming companies pressure young women to take out loans for surgery, promising a shot at influencer fame.",
      "But behind the scenes, these firms often have undisclosed agreements with clinics - taking a cut from every applicant they send to the operating table.",
      "In a bohemian-style caf\u00e9 in Beijing, the perfect setting for a selfie, Abby meets her friends for coffee.",
      "The trio adjust their poses and edit their faces in great detail - extending eyelashes and reshaping their cheekbones.",
      "When asked what they like most about their facial features, they hesitate, struggling to name a single part they wouldn't consider altering.",
      "The conversation turns to chin implants, upper-lip shortening, and nose surgery.",
      "Abby says she's thinking about another nose job - her current one is six years old - but surgeons are finding it difficult to operate.",
      "\"My skin isn't as stretchable after so many procedures. The doctors don't have much to work with. You can't give them enough fabric for a vest and expect a wedding dress.\"",
      "The metaphor lingers in the air, underscoring the toll taken by all of the operations.",
      "But despite everything, Abby has no plans to stop.",
      "\"I don't think I'll ever stop my journey of becoming more beautiful.\""

      "To be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.",
      "\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.",
      "\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"",
      "This \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says.",
      "Businesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.",
      "The report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.",
      "Rioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment.",
      "The irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.",
      "Even more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.",
      "The sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.",
      "\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"",
      "Over 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages",
      "Even the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.",
      "\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.",
      "It says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.",
      "Authorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen."

      "A short video released by the Vatican upon his death showed his intimate relationship with the Palestinian territory's tiny Christian community, many of whom he came to know by name.",
      "During 18-months of war, he took to calling them nightly to check on their wellbeing.",
      "\"What did you eat today?\" the Pope asks the local priests in the video, having switched to Italian. \"The rest of the chicken from yesterday,\" replies Father Gabriel Romanelli.",
      "Only a few hundred Christians remain in Gaza among the territory's almost entirely Muslim population of more than 2 million. Many have been living, as well as worshipping, at the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza City.",
      "With the Pope's death they feel they have lost a dear friend.",
      "\"He used to call us daily during the war, on the black days under the bombing - on the days when people were killed and injured,\" Father Romanelli said.",
      "\"Sometimes, we didn't have a phone connection for hours and the Pope with all of his responsibilities would try to reach us.\"",
      "George Anton, a local Catholic, is the emergency coordinator in the Holy Family church. He told me that shock left him virtually speechless the first time he spoke to the Pope but that he ended up talking to him regularly on video calls.",
      "He explained to the pontiff how he had lost his home and relatives.",
      "\"He was all the time blessing me and he was totally understanding our situation and he always encouraged us to be strong,\" Mr Anton said.  \"And he asked 'What can I do for you? What more can I do for you'?\"",

      "On Sunday in his Easter message, his last public appearance, he was again calling for peace and a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "With his words read by an aide, he said: \"The terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.''",
      "\"War is not just weapons.  War is sometimes words,\" the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said when I asked him about the Pope's final address.  He said the Pope had a moral clarity.",
      "\"Pope Francis recently, especially in the last year, has been very outspoken about the situation of the Holy Land, calling for the liberation of the hostages, but also condemning the dramatic situation, the ongoing war in Gaza and the situation for Palestinians,\" the cardinal said.",
      "Israeli media has noted that while President Isaac Herzog expressed condolences to the Catholic world, there were not similar comments from the prime minister or foreign minister as would have been expected - widely attributed to the Pope's strong positions against the Gaza war.",
      "Some of his most explicit criticism of Israel came late last year when excerpts of an upcoming book were published.",
      "\"According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,\" Pope Francis wrote.",
      "\"It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.\"",
      "Israel firmly rejects allegations of genocide in Gaza and says its war goal is to defeat Hamas.",
      "As a conclave gets under way in Rome this week to decide Pope Francis's successor, Palestinians and Israelis will be watching closely to see what the next Pope has to say about their intractable conflict.",
      "Christians in Gaza say they hope that whoever is chosen will be pushing for peace."

      "EXPLAINER: How the next pope is chosen",
      "It came as a surprise to many \u2013 including Bergoglio himself \u2013 that he was elected to the highest office in the Catholic Church in the first place.",
      "At 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.",
      "\"When he left Buenos Aires for the conclave, he seemed somewhat sad; he was getting ready to retire in a room at the Priests' Home in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores,\" Guillermo Marc\u00f3, a priest from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, told Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn.",
      "However, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.",
      "His death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.",
      "Those qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo  during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.",
      "The fact he did not return to his homeland was \"a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country\", Ms Ramazol said.",
      "Gustavo Vera exchanged hundreds of letters with Francis, having become friends with him when he was still archbishop. He agreed that the pontiff always showed an enduring interest in what was happening in his home country.",
      "\"Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,\" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news \"in detail\", he added.",
      "During his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.",
      "He was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.",
      "The initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey suggested that the proportion of people who held a positive view of the pontiff fell from 91% in 2013 to 64% in 2024.",
      "Of six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.",
      "Conservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.",
      "Critics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.",
      "Every time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.",
      "\"I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,\" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.",
      "Some fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.",
      "The pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.",
      "Mr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.",
      "\"He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,\" Mr Vera said.",
      "The \"rift\" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Per\u00f3n in the 1940s.",
      "There is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: \"If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?\"",
      "The comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.",
      "Before taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis \"the representation of evil on Earth\" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.",
      "The two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.",
      "Some Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.",
      "But according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people \"from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina\".",
      "The late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.",
      "Although he maintained his connection with Argentina, Mr Vera said, Pope Francis no longer felt he belonged to just one country.",
      "\"Argentines believe he was Argentinian, but in reality, he was a citizen of the world,\" he added.",
      "It is a view shared by Alejandra Castro, a social worker who was among the mourners who gathered on Monday night at Buenos Aires cathedral.",
      "Argentina was \"always in his prayers\", Ms Castro said. \"In one way or another, he was always present, and I think that shows that in his heart, Argentina was always present.\"",
      "But Mr Vera acknowledged that not everyone felt the same way, and suggested it was up to Argentines to look within themselves for answers: \"Rather than blaming Francis, we Argentines should ask ourselves what we were doing that meant we did not deserve the Pope's visit.\"",

      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",
      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",

      "VISUAL GUIDE: How the next Pope is chosen by secret vote",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

    "summary": "Legendary trumpeter Herb Alpert marked his 90th birthday with a Lincoln Center performance and a new tour.",
    "story": [
      "Legendary trumpeter Herb Alpert celebrated his 90th birthday last month by taking the stage at Jazz at Lincoln Center with a new iteration of the Tijuana Brass, marking his return to the iconic group format for the first time in 40 years.",
      "The milestone performance coincides with the 60th anniversary of his landmark album \"Whipped Cream & Other Delights,\" which spent eight weeks at No. 1 after its 1965 release and helped define the sound of the era.",
      "\"It has been overwhelming. I didn't realize I'd get this much attention at 90,\" Alpert said.",
      "Alpert's distinctive brass sound, inspired by bullfights in Tijuana, dominated the 1960s music landscape \u2014 appearing in television commercials, game shows like \"The Dating Game,\" and films including \"Casino Royale.\" At his commercial peak in 1966, Alpert had three albums in the top five simultaneously and outsold The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Frank Sinatra.",
      "\"Sometimes I was even a little embarrassed by it all,\" Alpert admitted.",
      "His classic hit \"Ladyfingers\" recently found new life on TikTok, generating what Alpert described as \"three billion streams\" on YouTube, a phenomenon he finds \"strange, because I recorded it like 60 years ago.\"",
      "The trumpet virtuoso's career hasn't been without challenges. By 1969, while going through a divorce, Alpert faced a personal crisis with his instrument. He described the trumpet as \"my enemy\" as he struggled with confidence and technique. A breakthrough came after consulting New York brass teacher Carmine Caruso, who reminded him that the trumpet was \"just a piece of plumbing\" and that \"the instrument comes from deep inside you.\"",
      "Alpert also co-founded A&M Records with the late Jerry Moss, operating on a handshake agreement from 1962 until they sold the company in 1990. The two never signed a formal contract, a fact that still moves Alpert to tears when he recalls their partnership.",
      "Now touring with a newly assembled Tijuana Brass, Alpert says the music feels fresh again. Alpert continues to perform with his wife of 52 years, singer Lani Hall, whom he met when his label signed Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66.",
      "\"I try to be as authentic as I can when I play,\" he said. \"I'm playing in the moment of my life. And it's a hard place to get to. But that's the place I'm always looking for.\"",

    "story": [
      "All David Hyde Pierce has to do is step out on stage, and he gets applause, even before he launches into the idiotic tongue-twister from \"The Pirates of Penzance\":",
      "I am the very model of a modern Major-General,I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historicalFrom Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical",
      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",

      "On Tuesday, the board voted to recommend a pardon for the singer. Ultimately, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee will make the final decision. A spokesperson told CBS News the governor would follow a \"comprehensive review process\" and added that he generally announces pardons annually in December.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who has known Jelly Roll for years, contributed a letter of support to his pardon application.",

      "What did Jelly Roll serve jail time for?",
      "Lyrics from the Jelly Roll's hit songs stem from personal experiences with drugs, crime, jail time and a family history of addiction. Starting at 14 years old, Jelly Roll spent a decade in and out of jail for drug possession, dealing, shoplifting and aggravated battery.",

      "Tina Knowles, the mother of global music superstars Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange, is opening up about her personal relationship with her mother, details about her divorces, her own parenting and the girl group Destiny's Child.",
      "Knowles, a businesswoman, fashion designer and former stylist for Destiny's Child, is telling her life story in her memoir, \"Matriarch,\" where she reveals a complicated but loving relationship with her own mother, who she described as \"overprotective\" and \"fearful.\"",
      "At one point, Knowles said she wanted to be a singer herself and was even in a girl group known as The Veltones.",
      "\"I wanted to be a singer, but you know, this little town was about that big and there were no singers there and that's what my mom said. My mom, as, you know, as much as I loved her and she wanted the best for me, she would've done anything for me to be a singer, she really didn't have any hope.\"",
      "She told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview that that aspect of her upbringing influenced how she parented.",
      "\"I was gonna trust my kids and even though I never believed in being friends, \u2026 but I wanted to be trusted by them,\" she said, adding that she wanted them to know the sky was the limit when it came to achieving their dreams.",
      "\"'Cause my parents put limitations on me. Not because they wanted to, because they didn't want me to be disappointed or hurt,\" she said. \"I told my girls that all the time, you could be whatever you wanna be. You could do whatever you wanna do and I'm gonna be right there to help make it happen.\"",
      "Impact on parenting",
      "Knowles spoke with King about how different her daughters were growing up. She said once a teacher recommended Beyonc\u00e9 repeat a grade in school. Knowles said, now a global superstar, Beyonc\u00e9 was shy and quiet until she got to know people.",
      "\"Never shy around us,\" Knowles said. \"At home, she was entertaining. She was singing, she was dancing and she was doing all the things that I did. \u2026 So she would get quiet until she got to know you.\"",
      "A former teacher told Knowles in her evaluation that Beyonc\u00e9 was a bright student.",
      "\"I took her to Ms. Little. ... Was an ex-teacher there who was very stern, but she said, 'there's nothing wrong with this girl. This girl is very bright. She just doesn't care to let you know it.'\"",
      "Conversely, Knowles described Solange as \"very outgoing\" and would \"walk into the room and be like, 'yes, I'm here.'\"",
      "When Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange were 12 and 7 years old, Knowles put them in therapy together. It was a controversial decision within her own family as her then husband, Mathew Knowles, objected.",
      "\"He was like, 'I don't want any parts of that,'\" Knowles said.",
      "For Knowles it was important as she started to see separation between her two daughters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 had become like this little star in the town and she was always so close to Solange and so kind to her, but then she was in the singing group, so everything took place in our house,\" she said. The other girls in the group would tell Solange to shut up and be quiet and all that and I started noticing that she wasn't protecting her sister.\"",
      "Knowles' goal through therapy was to ensure the two grew up close, telling King, \"whatever I have to do to make that happen.\"",
      "Beginnings of Destiny's Child",
      "Knowles said she tried to be a singer, and although for her it didn't work out, she used her skills to help her daughters achieve their dreams.",
      "\"God has always given me these tools from day one that I could go back and pull out and who would've ever thought that I would wind up making costumes for Destiny's Child? Or that I would be doing hair and all the things I did for our group and even the rehearsals and the discipline of that and the harmonies \u2026 I got to use it with the girls,\" she said.",
      "But Knowles admits there were problems along the way. She said the label didn't like the way she styled Destiny's Child.",
      "\"They dressed like an R&B group. We love the big glamour. And their hair was too big 'cause we came from Texas,\" she said. \"They just thought that it was too much for those young girls and that they should be in jeans and t-shirts like all the pop icons at the time. In the meantime, everywhere we went, people were saying,' Where can we get these outfits?'\"",
      "Knowles said the criticism from the label hurt her feelings, but it was a moment she remembers her husband, Mathew, pushing back.",
      "\"He was just bold and when I talk about him, that's one of the things that he went to bat for me all the time, he fought, he protected me.\"",
      "Navigating marriage and parenting criticisms",
      "Knowles also wrote candidly in her memoir about the highs and lows of her 30-year marriage to Mathew Knowles.",
      "She said from the beginning, there was infidelity in their marriage on his part and she realized she needed to be prepared.",
      "\"I was pregnant and things were \u2014 they just got really bad at that time. I knew that I had to make a move and I didn't want to be dependent on him,\" she said.",
      "She started planning what she called her escape plan. Knowles opened a hair salon called Headliners, which was so successful it became the family's main source of income and helped to fund Beyonc\u00e9's budding musical career. Mathew Knowles left his sales executive role at Xerox and started working as Destiny's Child's manager full-time. Their partnership as parents helped to hold their marriage together.",
      "\"People say to me, 'how did you stay so long?' And I'm like, 'well, I was married for 33 years, but 33 years were not bad.' \u2026 You know, maybe 15 of them were bad, but we would have these long stretches where we would do really great.\"",
      "While their marriage struggled, Knowles said they were always present parents, but subject to scrutiny. She recalled the criticism people would say after Solange became pregnant as a teenager.",
      "\"Crazy stuff like, 'well you wasn't paying no attention. You're so busy running behind B that you couldn't see' \u2014 blah, blah, blah. I'm like, 'that is absolutely not true.'\"",
      "Knowles went on to say, people didn't understand Solange's history.",
      "\"They didn't know the backstory of Solange losing her best friend and wanting to hurry up and be a grownup 'cause she thought she wouldn't live so long.\"",
      "Knowles said Solange made it clear she was getting married.",
      "\"I said, 'OK, well let me at least give you a wedding,' you know, and made it memorable for her,\u00a0 but you can't control somebody else's life. It's their life.\"",
      "Knowles also wrote about an untrue rumor that surfaced during Beyonc\u00e9's first pregnancy, where people said she wasn't carrying the baby.",
      "\"She went on a show in Australia and she had this very broad cloth type of dress,\" Knowles said about Beyonc\u00e9. \"She wasn't huge pregnant. She was very proud of her little stomach and she bent over and the fabric of the dress bent \u2026 they started this vicious, horrible rumor that she wasn't pregnant.\"",
      "Knowles expressed her heartache over the situation and anger over people thinking her daughter faked a pregnancy and used prosthetics.",
      "\"I was never so enraged because this should have been a sacred experience and what they didn't know is that my child had been through a couple miscarriages, which were so painful.\"",
      "Knowles admitted she did not speak up even as the devastating rumor escalated, saying that Beyonc\u00e9 thought it would go away and handles these situations well.",
      "\"I'm not so good at that. I will cuss you out about my kids,\" Knowles said. \"That was one of the worst times of my life. It really was. I would cry, I would get so mad and I would get so upset.\"",
      "Divorces and moving forward",
      "When she decided to get divorced from Mathew Knowles, she said she spent a week in bed depressed. Her longtime therapist gave her an exercise to do: Make a list of accomplishments and failures.",
      "\"I had such an easy time writing the bad stuff. When I got to the positive stuff, I had such a hard time,\" she said. \"What I realized about myself is that I wasn't really comfortable with people telling me great things about me.\"",
      "She said she had not taken credit for some of her accomplishments in the past, like her work with Destiny's Child in an effort to be humble. She would tell herself, \"it's not about you.\"",
      "But then she started making her list.",
      "\"I started getting mad and writing those things down,\" she said. \"I started my salon. It was a success. You know, I raised some great kids. All the people I've met in my life, like I have had a hell of a life.\"",
      "Four years after her divorce from Mathew Knowles, Tina Knowles married actor Richard Lawson. They were together for 10 years. She said she feels grateful for the relationship, even though it ultimately ended.",
      "\"I've known Richard for 40-something years and I think he's a great person,\" she said. \"So I don't have any regrets about the time that we spent together. I did feel a lot of pressure about ending the marriage because I had so many people to come up to me and tell me about that hope, but \u2013 it's not a tragedy.\"",
      "She said she would love to find love again, but is at peace if she doesn't.",
      "\"I am finally feeling \u2014 it is sad that I'm 71 years old and I know that I am enough and if I don't I'm gonna be just fine because I got such a full, great life. And I'm so blessed, and you know, it's gonna be \u2013 it's all good.\"",

      "\"I've always tried to take care of myself. I just \u2026 was in disbelief,\" she told King.",
      "The American Cancer Society recommends a mammogram every 1 to 2 years for women over 55. Knowles explained she missed her routine screening during the COVID-19 pandemic and didn't reschedule until last year. Doctors then found two tumors. One was benign, and the other had Stage 1 cancer.",
      "She was later informed that had she maintained her regular screenings, detection might have occurred at Stage 0, which according to the American Cancer Society is when the cancer has not spread beyond the breast tissue.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "In 2013, when the aging Pope Benedict XVI, the conservative leader of the Catholic Church, resigned, the choice of a successor was nothing short of an election on the future direction of the Vatican. From the instant the progressive Argentinian cleric Jorge Mario Bergoglio walked out on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the papacy of Pope Francis (Dec. 17, 1936-April 21, 2025) signaled and end to \"business as usual.\" He began with his choice of taking the name of a saint who lived in poverty after hearing God call him to \"rebuild my church, for it is in ruins.\"",
      "And the new pope's pronouncements demonstrated a willingness to look beyond accepted Catholic orthodoxy. He frankly discussed topics that were controversial within the Church, including gay priests and the role of women\u00a0in leadership. He also offered a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "He spoke out to address the danger of climate change, criticized the global financial system, and favored the opening of borders not just for refugees from conflict but also for economic migrants.",
      "His charisma and humility earned him the label \"the People's Pope,\" while his willingness to take as inspiration the life of the humble founder of the Franciscan order rejuvenated some Catholics, and attracted non-Catholics to the pope's mission. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan described the \"Francis effect\" to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2017: \"The number of people that will come up to me as I'm walking the streets of New York and say, 'Hey, we like this guy, Francis. I haven't been to church in a while, but I'm taking a second look, okay?'\"",
      "The 266th pope was the first from the Americas. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of an accountant from Italy and the daughter of Italian immigrants, Bergoglio was ordained a priest with the Jesuit order, which he led during the country's violent dictatorship. He was named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, and in 1998 became archbishop. Three years later, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.",
      "His writings focused on social justice issues that would become among his chief concerns as pope: the poor, Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the need for a missionary church.",
      "His first trip outside Rome as pope was to the island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean, where he met with newly-arrived migrants. There, he denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" shown to refugees, many of whom had drowned while seeking a better life. In his homily during an open Mass there, Francis said, \"Who has wept for the deaths of these brothers and sisters? Who has wept for the people who were on the boat? For the young mothers carrying their babies? For these men who wanted something to support their families? We are a society that has forgotten the experience of weeping, of 'suffering with'; the globalization of indifference has taken from us the ability to weep! \u2026 Let us ask the Lord for the grace to weep over our indifference, to weep over the cruelty in the world, in ourselves, and even in those who anonymously make socio-economic decisions that open the way to tragedies like this.\"",
      "And despite his overall popularity, Francis did have his critics who believe he had blurred the lines around traditional Church teachings. For example, while stating that marriage was between a man and a woman, he also said that priests could bless same-sex couples.",
      "\"You bet there are some conservatives that are unhappy with Pope Francis,\" Cardinal Dolan told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"There're also some liberals that wish he would move much more radically and expeditiously in some of the reforms. So, you're gonna get it from both sides.\"",
      "In 2017, when \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Mo Rocca asked the pope why he chose the name Francis, the pontiff replied, \"It just came to me.\"",
      "He then left with a request of his audience: \"Pray for me; I need it.\""

      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",
      "Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims.",
      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said.",
      "\"These efforts are not about tracking individuals. All NIH-managed databases follow the highest standards of security and privacy, with the protection of personal health information as a top priority,\" the NIH said.",
      "The HHS statement marks the latest change to Kennedy's autism research effort in recent weeks, since he first announced the push at a White House meeting earlier this month.",
      "Bhattacharya told reporters earlier this week that he anticipated grant funding for the autism research would \"hopefully\" be awarded by September. That is later than the initial timeline outlined by Kennedy, who has said that \"by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.\"",
      "\"It's hard to guarantee when science will make an advance. It depends on, you know, nature has its say,\" Bhattacharya has said.",

      "California is providing the gift cards at the clinics, which are run by the state's vendor. The CDC also has a testing van from the agency's Avian Flu Influenza Area Surveillance Testing, or AFAST project, offering testing at some of the sites.",

      "\"There has been no change to our guidance for testing suspect cases, we are not aware of any symptomatic workers not being referred or tested for H5N1, and it is very unlikely that testing would be declined if H5N1 was suspected,\" the California spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",

      "Senator Ed Markey, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Friday that smaller enterprises deserve exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs, which the Massachusetts Democrat criticized as \"recklessly imposed.\"",
      "Markey also noted that the Trump administration has moved to shield corporate giants such as Apple and Google from the impact of some its trade policies, and he pressed the White House to protect small businesses. The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",
      "\"Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, but because they operate on razor-thin margins, they are uniquely vulnerable to rising costs caused by the Trump Tariffs. These businesses simply do not have the financial cushion to absorb price shocks or the resources to navigate sudden changes to an already complex supply channel,\" Markey wrote.",
      "Under President Trump, the U.S. has hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to as much as 145%, while products from most other countries are subject to 10% tariffs. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of U.S. trading partners, but earlier this month\u00a0paused them for 90 days.",

    "summary": "The push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal funding will cost taxpayers money, nonpartisan group finds. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new analysis from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year.",
      "The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",
      "PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiple lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS.",
      "DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept a deferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since been rehired after a court ruling.",
      "Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such as bird flu experts\u00a0who were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting their weekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\"",
      "\"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect.",
      "The White House took issue with the analysis.",
      "\"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\"",
      "Why job cuts could raise costs",
      "The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly\u00a040% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated.",
      "But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. One analysis by researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost.",
      "\"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said.",
      "DOGE's \"wall of receipts\"",
      "DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on its\u00a0website in what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, a February CBS News investigation found.",
      "At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which President Trump has vowed not to touch.",
      "Musk said Tuesday that he'll curtail his work at DOGE starting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work.",
      "Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste.",
      "\"I'll have to continue to keep doing it for the remainder of the president's term to make sure the waste and fraud doesn't come roaring back,\" he said during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.",

    "summary": "Prices on thousands of of goods sold on Amazon, Temu and Shein are rising as U.S. tariffs on China boost import costs.",
    "story": [
      "American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, especially online.",
      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%, according to the company's analysis.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone chargers to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"Amazon consistently offers the lowest prices across the widest selection. We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",
      "Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan.",
      "Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quickly\u00a0denied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation.",

      "\"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\"",
      "By 2050, 26 states will take an economic hit due to their aging populations changes, with GDP declining by $162.3 billion from 2050 to 2100 over that period, according to a new analysis from PwC. Those states range from Maine to Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about baby bonuses.",
      "How much has the U.S. birth rate declined?",
      "About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hit a new record low.",
      "The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "What's causing the decline?",
      "That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022\u00a0analysis of the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact.",
      "But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\"",
      "Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote.",
      "Could financial incentives increase the birth rate?",
      "Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success.",
      "Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000.",
      "After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011.",
      "But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic data shows.",
      "\"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post.",
      "How much does it cost to raise a child?",
      "Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recent analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.",
      "How would a U.S. baby bonus work?",
      "Typically such incentives are paid either through a tax credit or a government check, similar to the stimulus checks that were given to millions of households during the pandemic.",
      "Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit.",
      "\"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born \u2014 there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in a recent post at the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\"",
      "How much would a $5,000 baby bonus cost the U.S.?",
      "If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year.",
      "That could be tough to pass at a time when Republican lawmakers are seeking to reduce federal spending in order to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, which is currently part of a bill advancing in Congress.",

      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20 points, or 0.1%, to close at 40,114, while the S&P 500 added 40 points, or 0.7%, to close at 5,525. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3% thanks to boost from a handful of Big Tech stocks, including Nvidia.",
      "Mr. Trump had adopted a softer stance on trade in recent days, allaying investors' concerns and helping trigger a three-day relief rally following a volatile trading day on Monday. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research note that negative activity in the market played a \"key role\" in the president's decision to reconsider his steep tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which currently total 145%.",
      "Meanwhile, the markets are also reacting to mixed signals from the White House about potential trade deals.",
      "Mr. Trump this week hinted at a possible trade deal with China, but the Chinese government has denied the two countries are in\u00a0active negotiations.\u00a0CNN did report\u00a0that China was rolling back the 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. semiconductors, a sign it could be relaxing its stance.",
      "\"We're in a headline driven market, and we're prone to volatility spikes and outsized trading ranges in both directions,\" said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"And you know, it's probably going to remain that type of market until we at least have more clarity on what's going on.\"",
      "In a Time interview released Friday morning, Mr. Trump suggested his administration has struck 200 trade deals with countries, and that those would be announced in the next three to four weeks.",
      "CEOs: \"Elevated uncertainty\"",
      "On Thursday and Friday, several companies cautioned that uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's trade war is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year.",
      "Intel weighed on the market after the chip company said it's seeing \"elevated uncertainty across the industry\" and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 6.8% even though its results for the beginning of the year topped expectations.",
      "Eastman Chemical fell 5.9% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts' expectations. CEO Mark Costa said that the \"macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased\" and that future demand for its products \"is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs.\"",
      "Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 4.3%.",
      "Trade deals",
      "Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days \u2014 providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity.",
      "\"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note.",
      "Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts.",
      "Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this week\u00a0reported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say.",
      "\"The April 2 rose garden start on tariffs might have been the high water mark, but you're still talking about a significant burden that is being imposed on companies and the economy from tariffs,\" said Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at Vital Knowledge. \"And that's not going away.\"",
      "While the U.S. stock market lost some steam on Friday, an ease in 10-year Treasury yields and a rebound in U.S. dollar index provided welcome signs of relief.

    "summary": "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg says his tariff costs will surge more than 40-fold to $100 million, while sales could fall.",
    "story": [
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg thinks the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs will be catastrophic for both his family-owned toy business and for the broader U.S. economy. That's why he's suing President Trump.",
      "Woldenberg's business has 500 employees and sells thousands of learning-based toys like Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog and the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register. Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties. Congress has historically held the power to authorize new tariffs or make trade deals with other nations.",
      "With the administration's higher tariffs in place, the math is dire for Learning Resources, Woldenberg said. The company's import duties are set to increase from $2.3 million prior to the Trump administration to $100 million \u2014 a roughly 4,000% increase, he said.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic\"",
      "At the same time, Woldenberg said he expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year as consumers scale back spending due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's trade war, the CEO had forecast an 8% increase in sales. Economists on Wall Street\u00a0say the tariffs\u00a0will slow U.S. economic growth while boosting inflation.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic,\" Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Forces have been unleashed in the economy \u2014 the world economy as well as the U.S. economy \u2014 that will have consequences that will be irreparable.\"",
      "Learning Resources' suit asks the court to find that Mr. Trump's tariffs are unlawful and to block the administration from collecting the levies. Based in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Learning Resources is a private, family-owned business founded in 1984.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the suit or the company's financial challenges caused by the tariffs.",
      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",
      "\"They should go back to the way things were on January 19th and figure out another plan. This one is not working,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon.

      "Bessent, who delivered the keynote address at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C., today, said that the Trump administration wants the U.S. economy to rebalance toward more manufacturing, while urging China to shift away from what he called \"export-led manufacturing growth.\"",
      "\"China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change \u2014 because we need rebalancing too,\" Bessent said in the speech.",
      "Beijing's export-reliant economic model is \"unsustainable\" and harms both China and the rest of the world, Bessent added. At the same time, the Treasury chief maintained that \"America First does not mean America alone,\" a comment that comes after the Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration is considering slashing tariffs on China to de-escalate tensions between the two largest global economies.",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",

      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 07:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal health officials want companies to swap out certain food dyes with natural alternatives.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is asking the food industry to stop using synthetic food dyes, in a bid to fulfill one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals to swap them out with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The FDA's move stops short of the outright ban that had been floated for in Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform from the campaign trail. Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a \"national standard and timeline for the industry\" to voluntarily make the switch.",
      "\"Let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes. But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan.",
      "Makary said he had had \"wonderful meetings with the food industry\" and claimed that they are eager to remove artificial dyes from the food supply.",
      "\"They want to do it. So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this,\" Makary said.",
      "HHS says the FDA will be \"working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes\" and will also be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.",
      "Response from the food industry",
      "The food dye industry denied that there was a safety concern with artificial dyes, citing past reviews by the FDA and other international authorities, and said that their use is \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\"",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to products supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",
      "\"For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world, on our nation's children, without their consent,\" said Makary.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

      "More than 5 million borrowers are in default and 4 million more could be in the same position in a few months, which would put nearly a quarter of the federal student loan portfolio in default, according to the Education Department. Less than 40% of borrowers are current on their student loan payments.",
      "In the next two weeks, those in default will receive emails informing them of the next steps and urging them to look into repayment options. Wage garnishment notices will be sent out later this summer.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he isn't planning on firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after calling Powell a \"major loser.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

    "summary": "Tesla's sales and stock price have taken a hit this year amid blowback over CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a corporate reckoning on Tuesday, with the electric car maker's first-quarter results showing sales and profit fell short of analyst expectations while the billionaire was focused on leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts.",
      "Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla.",
      "\"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\"",
      "That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "But Musk's activities with DOGE \u2014 including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data \u2014 have alienated some consumers and sparked protests across the globe, causing the stock price to deflate.",
      "Investors got an answer on Tuesday afternoon, with Musk announcing on a call to discuss the company's earnings that he plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE, beginning next month.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\"",
      "Tariff impact",
      "The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for many vehicles, including Teslas.",
      "Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call.",
      "The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\"",
      "Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.",
      "\"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded.",
      "What time is the Tesla earnings call?",
      "Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.",
      "Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead.",
      "But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout.",
      "Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk told Tesla investors that he plans to scale back his time at the Department of Government Efficiency.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk told Tesla investors he's scaling back his work at the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying the amount of time he spends on the task force will \"drop significantly\" starting in May.",
      "As the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiative, DOGE has slashed tens of thousands of federal jobs in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse. But DOGE has also sparked a backlash \u2014 and plenty of lawsuits \u2014 as critics accuse it of accessing voters' private data and cutting programs that are vital to many Americans.",
      "At the same time, Tesla's sales have taken a hit as the automaker's vehicles have increasingly become a symbol of the Trump administration, repelling some consumers. The stock has also plunged more than 50% from its most recent high in December, when the shares surged after the presidential election on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said on a conference call to discuss Tesla's earnings.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, jumped 4% to $247.53 after Musk vowed to scale back his work at DOGE.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter earnings, announced Tuesday, fell far short of analyst expectations, with revenue tumbling 9% and profit slumping 71%.",
      "Musk's leaving DOGE might not heal the wounds that Tesla has suffered due to Musk's activities, some analysts say.",
      "\"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that,\" noted Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge in a Tuesday research note. \"On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive.\"",
      "Tesla's issues go beyond politics. The company that once dominated the EV market is now facing fierce competition from U.S. automakers such as Ford to rivals in Europe that are offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real alternatives.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese EV maker BYD announced it had developed an electric battery charging system that can fully power up a vehicle within minutes.",
      "Tariff retaliation from China is also likely to hurt Tesla. The company was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its Model S and Model X. It makes the Model Y and Model 3 for the Chinese market at its factory in Shanghai, the Associated Press reported.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 16:18:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Record consumer debt, years of steep inflation and other factors are driving more Americans to considering filing for bankruptcy.",
    "story": [
      "The number of Americans considering bankruptcy is soaring to its highest level since just before the pandemic, a potentially alarming sign as clouds gather over the economy.",
      "Personal bankruptcy inquiries surged in the first three months of the year, according to data from LegalShield, a provider of consumer legal services. The jump could augur a potential wave of\u00a0bankruptcy filings\u00a0as consumers start to buckle under a record level of debt and as\u00a0tariffs fuel inflation, the company warned in a report this week.",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings in the U.S. averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but fell sharply during the pandemic itself as Americans were buoyed by trillions of dollars in government aid and relief.",
      "LegalShield now expects bankruptcies to surge as soon as this this summer. \"Consumers are calling lawyers to ask questions because they can't pay their bills or are having trouble, and they ask about the process of filing for bankruptcy,\" Matt Layton, LegalShield senior vice president of consumer analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Why are more Americans mulling bankruptcy?",
      "Heavy consumer debts, years of stiff inflation and higher interest rates are squeezing Americans' budgets, according to Layton. Billing disputes, debt collections and other leading indicators of bankruptcy are also on the rise.",
      "\"Our members are calling and saying, 'I don't have enough money at the end of month to pay my bills.' They're asking which ones to pay and which ones to put off. They're saying, 'They're coming to get my car \u2014 what can I do about these things?'\" Layton said.",
      "The jump in Americans who are considering declaring bankruptcy reflects the tough economic economic and financial conditions that have prevailed 2020, experts said. Total household debt as of the end of 2024 hit an all-time of\u00a0$18 trillion, while the percentage of Americans falling seriously behind on their debts also rose last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "\"Quarterly filings from the U.S. courts will come out soon, and I'd expect to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in personal bankruptcy filings from the end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025,\" Pamela Foohey, a bankruptcy professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am not surprised attorneys say they're hearing from people who are looking to file for bankruptcy now because it's April. This is when people get their tax returns, so they have money to file for bankruptcy with,\" she added, noting that it costs money to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the most common type of personal filing. \"If they are getting their tax return, that's the time to file because they have an infusion of money.\"",
      "Economists warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including heavy tariffs on China and other key trading partners, is likely to stoke inflation while dampening economic growth. Still, the flood of people weighing bankruptcy now reflects the steady rise in financial stress in recent years rather than current economic conditions, Foohey emphasized.",
      "\"Rising [bankruptcy] filings will show that people have been struggling with their finances for years when they do file, and things have been getting incrementally worse month after month now for years,\" she said. \"It's been building, and it's only going to get worse unless something is done about inflation, unless something is done about tariffs.\"",
      "When should you file for bankruptcy?",
      "As Foohey notes, bankruptcy typically comes after a prolonged period of financial stress. Although some Americans struggle to overcome the stigma of bankruptcy, experts recommend filing for protection sooner rather than later in order to shield their assets from creditors.",
      "Filing for bankruptcy can help an individual liquidate their assets to pay off their debt or create a repayment plan. Individuals may file for file\u00a0Chapter 7\u00a0or\u00a0Chapter 13\u00a0bankruptcy, and all bankruptcy cases are handled in federal courts.",
      "But bankruptcy expert Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign College of Law, said declaring bankruptcy accomplishes one thing: wiping out people's debt.",
      "\"It doesn't get you a job, it doesn't get you a raise, it doesn't put money on the table,\" he said. \"Filing for bankruptcy protection doesn't make sense when things are still on the way down. It makes sense to file when you're in the hole, but starting to climb out of it.\"",

      "Senator Ed Markey, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Friday that smaller enterprises deserve exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs, which the Massachusetts Democrat criticized as \"recklessly imposed.\"",
      "Markey also noted that the Trump administration has moved to shield corporate giants such as Apple and Google from the impact of some its trade policies, and he pressed the White House to protect small businesses. The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",
      "\"Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, but because they operate on razor-thin margins, they are uniquely vulnerable to rising costs caused by the Trump Tariffs. These businesses simply do not have the financial cushion to absorb price shocks or the resources to navigate sudden changes to an already complex supply channel,\" Markey wrote.",
      "Under President Trump, the U.S. has hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to as much as 145%, while products from most other countries are subject to 10% tariffs. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of U.S. trading partners, but earlier this month\u00a0paused them for 90 days.",
      "Trump administration officials have defended the tariffs, saying they will protect the domestic manufacturing sector, foster economic growth as more companies shift their production to the U.S. and generate billions in federal revenue.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "\"So clearly their impact is going to be stronger, the short term pain is going to be much harder felt on all of them,\" Guzman said.",
      "Some small business owners say tariffs are already having an adverse impact. Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, a U.S.-based lingerie company that makes its garments in China, recently told CBS MoneyWatch that the stepped up U.S. tariffs could force het to abandon a whole season's worth of orders, equivalent to roughly $500,000.",

The spokesperson said there's a physical line running between the computer monitor in the defense secretary's office and his cellphone, which is kept immediately outside his office.

It was the second Signal group chat where Hegseth shared the information.",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel said Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan \"intentionally misdirected federal agents away\" from an immigrant who is in the U.S. illegally and was set to be arrested.",
      "Patel said that the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, was later arrested and is currently being detained.",
      "Dugan was arrested at 8 a.m. on Friday at the courthouse where she works, according to a federal law enforcement source. She was charged with two counts of obstruction and released from detention after making an initial appearance in federal court.",
      "According to a sworn statement by an FBI agent, Flores-Ruiz was deported from the United States in 2013 and illegally reentered the U.S. During this period, Flores-Ruiz was accused of committing battery.",
      "After a fingerprint match from Flores-Ruiz's first arrest in 2013 and a local case in Milwaukee, a warrant for his arrest and deportation was issued by ICE.",

      "\"Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,\" the agent wrote. Dugan, according to witnesses, told the arrest team to go to the chief judge's office to speak with them about the permissibility of making the arrest inside the courthouse, and looked around the hallway near her courtroom to seek out other law enforcement officers who were waiting to arrest Flores-Ruiz.",
      "One agent, who Dugan did not recognize as part of the arrest team, remained in the hallway waiting for Flores-Ruiz.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and the rest of 'the Squad,' saying they're going to educate people to their constitutional rights on not opening the door for others.\"",
      "Homan went on: \"We all know that it's about evading arrest. Don't open your door when ICE comes to your door. You have an order of deportation issued by a federal judge. If you and I ignored that order, we'd be in jail. But you've got members of Congress out there saying, 'You don't have to open the door for ICE, they need a warrant. You don't have to talk to ICE.' It's just, we all know what the end game is. The end game is, yeah, you can call it educating constitutional rights. Don't disagree. But we all know what the end game is: evade arrest, put off the arrest. So, that is hurting. But real soon, people are going to see that that's no longer going to work.\"",
      "When questioned about the issue of due process for immigrants, Homan responded, \"They get due process, everyone gets due process.\"",
      "Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, called the arrest a \"gravely serious and drastic move\" in a statement on social media. \"While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President's lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress's checks on his power,\" Baldwin said.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 08:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told \"Face the Nation\" that the Kremlin is \"ready to reach a deal,\" but some elements need to be \"fine tuned.\"",
    "story": [
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday that the Kremlin is \"ready to reach a deal\" with the U.S. on Ukraine, though he also said some elements need to be \"fine tuned.\"",
      "\"The President of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said in an interview Thursday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Lavrov declined to say what is being discussed in negotiations or whether any deal was imminent. He said the negotiations are \"not supposed to be public.\"",
      "\"The negotiations continue, and until the end of the negotiations, we cannot disclose what it is about,\" Lavrov said.",
      "The comments came after Russia struck Kyiv overnight Thursday, killing at least eight people and injuring more than 70, in the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital in months as President Trump pushes a proposal for an end to the war.",
      "Asked by Brennan what made it worth killing civilians after Ukraine had said in March that it's ready for a ceasefire, Lavrov said \"we only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military,\" adding that \"President Putin expressed this for so many times, and this is not different this time as well.\"",
      "Lavrov suggested that the attack was intentional, arguing that \"if this was a target used by the Ukrainian military,\" then the minister of defense and commanders in the field \"have the right to attack them.\"",
      "Still, on the talks with Ukraine, there are \"several signs that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said. Among them, he cited Mr. Trump as \"probably the only leader on Earth who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump issued a rare rebuke of the Russian president in a post on Truth Social Thursday morning, saying he's \"not happy\" with the Kyiv strikes, while noting that they took place as he worked to reach a peace deal. It was \"very bad timing,\" he said and addressed Putin, saying, \"Vladimir, STOP!\"",
      "Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, after first sending troops into eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia has claimed its offensive invasion was provoked by Ukraine and the West, an assertion that has been rejected by the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he believes Russia wants peace and continues to publicly criticize Ukraine's democratically elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in spite of Ukraine's acceptance of his proposed 30-day ceasefire. And along the campaign trail, he pledged to negotiate an end to the war in a day. But almost 100 days into his administration, an agreement eludes him.",
      "On Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance warned that Russia and Ukraine must reach a peace deal, as envoys from the U.K., France, the U.S, Ukraine and Germany met in London. Vance said the White House has \"issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process.\"",
      "Vance said the window for diplomacy was closing, and the U.S. envisions a freeze of military conflict more or less along existing lines. The Institute for the Study of War estimates that Russia holds roughly 18% of Ukrainian territory. In the meantime, U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg met in London with European allies and Ukraine on Wednesday. European partners are concerned that the U.S. position is focused on pressuring Ukraine, which is the victim of the Russian invasion, and not extracting any concessions to date from the aggressor.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the conflict by saying he wouldn't accept Russian control of Crimea as part of a ceasefire agreement. Crimea, located in Ukraine's southern peninsula, has been occupied by Russia since 2014.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post that the U.S. had not asked Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian territory, though he also said, \"Crimea was lost years ago,\" while Barack Obama was president. Mr. Trump said the parties are \"very close to a Deal, but the man with 'no cards to play' should now, finally, GET IT DONE.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon that \"we're putting a lot of pressure on Russia,\" although it was unclear what pressure he was referencing. The U.S. has not placed new sanctions on Russia, and the president has argued he considers it a concession by Putin that he has not seized Ukraine in its entirety. Mr. Trump reiterated that he thinks Russia \"wants to make a deal,\" but \"it takes two to tango.\"",
      "\"You have to have Ukraine want to make a deal too, and they're being hit very hard, and I do believe they want to make a deal,\" the president said.",
      "Zelenskyy reposted on social media a 2018 statement by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about Crimea that said, \"the United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin's claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law.\"",
      "That policy of arming Ukraine, and rejecting Russia's seizure of territory by force seems to have changed during the second Trump administration.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joined the president Thursday at the bilateral meeting with Norway's prime minister in the Oval Office, added that \"this war is endable,\" citing a \"great meeting\" on Wednesday, and meetings to come over the weekend.",
      "\"We've shown them the finish line, we need both of them to say yes,\" Rubio said. \"But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end.\"",

      "The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, admitted in a court filing that immigration agents typically need warrants before arresting individuals. But it argued that Khalil was arrested without a warrant due to \"exigent circumstances,\" alleging that agents believed the Columbia activist would \"escape before they could obtain a warrant.\"",
      "Khalil's lawyers denied that he had any plans to flee, saying in their own court filing that their client \"fully complied\" with the ICE agents' demands.",
      "\"Tellingly, no agent present at the scene has ever submitted sworn or unsworn testimony that Mr. Khalil attempted to flee or otherwise posed a flight risk,\" Khalil's lawyers wrote in a court document.",
      "A vocal member of the protests at Columbia University last year over the war in Gaza, Khalil is a Syrian-born immigrant with legal U.S. permanent residency \u2014 also known as a green card. He was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his U.S. citizen wife, who was pregnant at the time.",
      "Khalil was not able to witness the birth of his son\u00a0earlier this week, after ICE denied a request for him to be temporarily released.",
      "One of several foreign-born students arrested by ICE in recent months, Khalil has become one of the most high-profile faces of the Trump administration's efforts to go after those on college campuses who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests.",
      "The Trump administration has argued its efforts are designed to curb anti-semitism and pro-Hamas views at universities, but civil rights groups have accused the government of punishing students purely for their political beliefs, in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "While it has not accused Khalil of any criminal wrongdoing, the Trump administration has cited two legal grounds to argue the Columbia University activist should nonetheless be deported from the U.S.",
      "The administration has accused Khalil of committing immigration fraud by withholding certain information on his green card application and argued he's also deportable due to a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his presence and activities pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. Khalil's lawyers have refuted both accusations.",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled the administration could continue its bid to deport Khalil, saying she could not second-guess Rubio's determination, which cites a rarely used law. She held in abeyance the immigration fraud accusation.",
      "This week, Khalil formally submitted an application in immigration court to request asylum and withholding of removal, another legal protection from deportation, according to his attorneys.",
      "That immigration court case in Louisiana is progressing alongside a lawsuit in federal district court in New Jersey challenging the legality of Khalil's detention. Lawyers in that case have asked the federal judge overseeing it to order Khalil's release, revoke Rubio's determination and bar the government from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday agreed to block portions of President Trump's executive order that seeks to overhaul U.S. elections, including a provision that would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in federal elections.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly agreed to partially grant a preliminary injunction sought by three different groups of plaintiffs, including voting rights groups and the Democratic Party, finding that they are likely to prevail in their challenge.",
      "The judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing two provisions of the executive order signed by the president last month: the first orders the Election Assistance Commission, a federal independent regulatory commission, to add a \"documentary proof of U.S. citizenship\" requirement to the standardized national voter registration form; and the second ordered federal voter registration agencies to \"assess\" citizenship before providing a federal voter registration form to people who receive public assistance.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said that the president generally does not have the power to regulate federal elections.",
      "\"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the states \u2014not the president \u2014 with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" Kollar-Kotelly wrote in a 120-page opinion. \"Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the president purports to order. And no statutory delegation of authority to the executive branch permits the president to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order.\"",
      "In response to the decision, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said, \"President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship. Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our Constitutional Republic, and we're confident in securing an ultimate victory in the courtroom.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's directive follows years of unfounded claims raised by him and his allies that the 2020 election was rigged against him, allegations the president has continued to amplify during his second term in the White House. The order claims that the U.S. \"now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing.\"",
      "\"Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic. The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,\" the executive order states.",
      "While Congress has the power to decide how federal elections are run, and has done so through laws like the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, the Constitution gives state legislatures the authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" of holding elections.",
      "In addition to the now-blocked citizenship-related requirements, the president's executive order seeks to give the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and states access to certain databases to identify any noncitizens who are registered to vote; orders the attorney general to enforce two laws against states that include absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in the final tally of votes for president and Congress; and orders the Election Assistance Commission to condition federal funds on states adopting Election Day as the deadline for receiving ballots.",
      "Those provisions were at the center of the lawsuits filed by a slew of voting rights groups and arms of the Democratic Party, including the Democratic National Committee and the party's congressional leaders. They argued that the president did not have the power to issue those changes and could not make them unilaterally.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly agreed that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenge to two sections of the order, requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form and requiring people enrolled in public assistance programs to have their citizenship assessed before getting the federal voter registration form.",
      "But she declined to stop the Trump administration from implementing the other parts of the president's order as the litigation moves forward.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "As to the proof-of-citizenship requirement, Kollar-Kotelly wrote neither the Constitution nor federal voter registration law gives the president the authority to direct the Election Assistance Commission to change what is on the federal registration form.",
      "\"The president is free to state his views about what policies he believes that Congress, the EAC, or other federal agencies should consider or adopt. But in this case, the president has done much more than state his views: He has issued an 'order' directing that an independent commission 'shall' act to 'require' changes to an important document, the contents of which Congress has tightly regulated,\" the judge wrote. \"That command exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "On the second provision that Kollar-Kotelly blocked, she said people applying for public assistance programs are entitled to the federal voter registration form, not recipients who have complied with the identification requirements imposed by the programs.",
      "She said provisions of the National Voter Registration Act \"make clear that voter registration agencies' only role in enforcing states' citizenship requirement for voting is to provide the federal form to the applicant, who must then self-certify citizenship by signing the application 'under penalty of perjury.' The statute leaves no role for agencies to 'assess citizenship,' and the president lacks any lawful authority to contravene the NVRA by requiring agencies to do so.\"",
      "Roman Palomares, national president of the voting rights group LULAC, cheered Kollar-Kotelly's decision as a victory for voters and democracy.",
      "\"Efforts to silence the voice and votes of the U.S. electorate must not stand because our democracy depends on all voters feeling confident that they can vote freely and that their vote will be counted accurately,\" he said in a statement.",

      "Overnight, Russia attacked Kyiv with an hourslong barrage of missiles and drones, killing at least 12 people and injuring about 90 others in likely the deadliest assault on Ukraine's capital since July. The strikes came as peace talks have appeared to stall.",
      "\"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing,\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. \"Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!\"",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted he believes Russia wants peace, despite Moscow's continued assaults on Ukraine, more than three years into Russia's war.",
      "Although Mr. Trump said he would stop the war before taking office, his administration has so far been unable to broker a peace deal. And Mr. Trump has expressed his growing impatience with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin.",

      "\"His patience is wearing very thin,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. has \"issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process.\"",
      "\"I have my own deadline,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday on a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. He wouldn't say when that deadline is.",
      "Asked if he still believes Russia is serious about peace after it assaulted Kyiv with missiles and Ukraine overnight, the president said \"we are thinking that very strongly that they both want peace, but they have to get to the table.\"",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire federal judge on Thursday restricted the Trump administration's ability to cut or withhold federal funding from public schools that participate in some diversity and equity initiatives.",
      "U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty, appointed by former President Barack Obama, found that actions by the Trump administration and Education Secretary Linda McMahon to withhold funds would \"cripple the operations of many educational institutions,\" and are a violation of executive branch power in overseeing local school districts.",
      "The ruling is not nationwide, and is limited to any public schools that work with the plaintiffs in the case, the National Education Association and the Center for Black Educator Development. The NEA is America's largest teachers union, with more than 3 million members.",
      "The suit was filed after the Trump administration demanded that all 50 states agree that their public schools would not participate in programs that violate the Trump administration's definition of violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",
      "In a February letter to states, the Education Department asserted that U.S. public schools have embraced \"pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences,\" that \"emanated throughout every facet of academia,\" including schools engaging with the \"false premise that the United State is built upon 'systemic and structural racism.'\"",
      "The letter instructed schools to ensure that their policies \"comply with existing civil rights laws,\" or risk potentially losing billions in Title I money that helps low-income students across the country.",
      "If the Trump administration succeeded with its attempts to keep diversity efforts out of schools, McCafferty wrote that public schools would likely eliminate teaching roles that involve race or censor teachers who teach about race.",
      "\"Would the Department conclude that a history teacher leading a class discussion on the economic development of the antebellum south has violated Title VI? What about an English teacher assigning students to write a paper comparing the persecution of Tom Robinson\u2014whom Atticus Finch championed in To Kill a Mockingbird\u2014to that of Emmett Till? And how would such lessons even relate to a \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" program?\" McCafferty wrote in her opinion. \"These are not hypotheticals. School teachers throughout the country are asking themselves these and similar questions in the wake of the 2025 Letter.\"",
      "McCafferty also found that the Trump administration's definition of diversity, equity and inclusion as unlawful is \"in stark contrast to the dictionary definition of DEI\" and \"inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the phrase.\"",
      "National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement to reporters that \"today's ruling allows educators and schools to continue to be guided by what's best for students, not by the threat of illegal restrictions and punishment.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said President Trump is \"protecting the civil rights of all Americans by ending radical DEI programs that violate Supreme Court precedent in order to safeguard the Constitution's promise of equality before the law. Any judge objecting to this effort is making a mockery of the Constitution they swore an oath to uphold.\"",
      "The crackdown on diversity and equity programs in schools is part of a broader rebuke of DEI initiatives by the Trump administration. Shortly after taking office, Mr. Trump signed executive orders directing an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, and required federal contractors to certify that they do not engage in certain DEI initiatives.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily halted her order requiring the Trump administration to provide information on its efforts so far to retrieve Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month \u2014 just one day after accusing the administration of demonstrating \"bad faith\" in the proceedings.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, the Department of Justice asked Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to stay her directive to provide testimony and documents on Abrego Garcia for seven days, and Abrego Garcia's lawyers filed a response. Hours later, Xinis granted a stay of the discovery process until April 30 at 5 p.m. with \"the agreement of the parties.\"",
      "The reason for the stay is unclear since both parties' filings are sealed. Xinis did not explain her reasoning.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told CBS News in a statement his team is \"not at liberty to speak about the current status of the case at this time,\" citing the seal on the court documents. \"We remain focused on bringing Kilmar Abrego Garcia home, and we will not rest until he is brought home,\" he added.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Xinis' decision to stay discovery for a week came one day after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order for expedited discovery in the case. In a scathing order Tuesday, Xinis said the administration had shown a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations,\" and ordered the government to respond to questions by Wednesday at 6 p.m.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was detained last month and flown to El Salvador, part of a wave of hundreds of migrants \u2014 including alleged gang members \u2014 sent by the Trump administration to the country's notorious Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT) supermax prison. A judge previously barred Abrego Garcia from being removed to El Salvador in 2019, citing the risk of persecution by the country's gangs.",
      "The Trump administration conceded in court Abrego Garcia's deportation was an \"administrative error,\" but has declined to return him to the U.S., accusing him of membership in the MS-13 gang \u2014 which his lawyers deny, noting he hasn't been charged with a crime.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has turned into a legal showdown. Xinis ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" his return to the U.S., which the Supreme Court affirmed, but the administration has argued it's up to El Salvador to return him. Xinis has suggested the government hasn't adequately complied with her orders.",
      "The U.S. has claimed that much of the information is protected because it involves state secrets, government deliberations and attorney client privilege. But Xinis has rejected the argument and demanded that the Trump administration provide specific justifications for each claim of privileged information by Wednesday evening.",
      "A three-judge panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scolded the administration last week, saying its claim that it can't do anything to free Abrego Garcia \"should be shocking.\" That ruling came one day after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt in a different case for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that directed the Pentagon to develop a policy that would bar transgender people from serving in the military.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to allow his administration's policy prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military to take effect while legal challenges to the ban move forward.",
      "The request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes after a federal appeals court left in place a lower court order that prevents the Trump administration from enforcing the ban nationwide. The administration has attacked these broad orders, known as nationwide or universal injunctions, issued by federal district court judges as improperly setting policy for the country.",
      "Mr. Trump banned transgender people from serving in the military during his first term in office, which the Supreme Court in 2019 allowed to take effect,\u00a0but the policy was rescinded by former President Joe Biden. When Mr. Trump returned to office in January for his second term, he issued a new executive order that declared it to be U.S. government policy to \"establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,\" and said that policy is \"inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.\"",
      "The president's directive said that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "On the heels of the president's order, the Defense Department issued a new policy in February that generally disqualifies from military service people with gender dysphoria or who have undergone medical interventions for gender dysphoria. The plan from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth required all military branches to start identifying transgender service members and begin the process of separating them from service on March 26 unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a\u00a0January report\u00a0from the Congressional Research Service. The Justice Department has said that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, but a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a\u00a0Feb. 26 memo\u00a0from the Pentagon.",
      "The case before the Supreme Court arose out a challenge to the ban filed in Washington state, which was brought by seven transgender service members, one transgender person who wants to join the military and an advocacy group. They argued that the president's ban violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and the First Amendment.",
      "A federal district court in March agreed to block implementation of the executive order and required the Trump administration to maintain the policy put in place by its predecessor.",
      "In his opinion granting a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle said the Trump administration did not put forth any evidence that allowing transgender people to serve openly harmed military readiness, unit cohesion or lethality.",
      "\"The government's unrelenting reliance on deference to military judgment is unjustified in the absence of any evidence supporting 'the military's' new judgment reflected in the Military Ban \u2014 in its equally considered and unquestionable judgment, that very same military had only the week before permitted active-duty plaintiffs (and some thousands of others) to serve openly,\" he wrote.",
      "Settle was appointed to the district court in Tacoma by President George W. Bush and was a captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps, serving as a prosecutor in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and defense counsel in Fort Lewis, Washington.",
      "Settle wrote in his opinion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, and said they raised \"serious and important questions.\"",
      "\"Because the military has operated smoothly for four years under the Austin Policy, any claimed hardship it may face in the meantime pales in comparison to the hardships imposed on transgender service members and otherwise qualified transgender accession candidates, tipping the balance of hardships sharply toward plaintiffs,\" he said, referencing former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who led the Pentagon under Biden. \"There can be few matters of greater public interest in this country than protecting the constitutional rights of its citizens.\"",
      "The Justice Department then asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to pause that decision, allowing it the ban to take effect, but it denied the request.",
      "A similar challenge to Mr. Trump's ban was filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where it, too, was blocked from taking effect. But the federal appeals court in Washington agreed to temporarily halt that order and heard arguments Tuesday on whether to keep its block in place while the appeal continues.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the courts should give \"substantial deference\" to the Defense Department's military judgments.",
      "\"Absent a stay, the district court's universal injunction will remain in place for the duration of further review in the Ninth Circuit and in this court \u2014 a period far too long for the military to be forced to maintain a policy that it has determined, in its professional judgment, to be contrary to military readiness and the nation's interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer rejected the claim that the administration's rules discriminate based on transgender status and sex and said the policy draws classifications based on a medical condition \u2014 gender dysphoria \u2014 and related medical interventions, which means it satisfies the lowest, most deferential standard of judicial review.",
      "\"The Constitution entrusts to the political branches the authority to determine the composition of the armed forces. The department exercised that authority in adopting the 2025 policy to exclude 'individuals who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,'\" he wrote. \"The district court's injunction nevertheless forces the military to maintain a different policy \u2014 one that the department has concluded is inconsistent with 'the best interests of the military services' and with 'the interests of national security.'\"",

      "The president also signed an order to enforce laws on the books requiring universities to disclose when they accept large foreign gifts, with one of Mr. Trump's top aides specifically calling out Harvard as a school they believe has violated the law. Federal law requires higher education institutions that receive federal funds to disclose any gifts or contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year, and some in Congress are trying to lower that threshold to $50,000.",

      "Colleges and universities are accredited to ensure they meet basic standards by third-party entities, not the federal government, though the Department of Education decides which accrediting agencies to recognize. The accreditation process has broad implications since the government uses it to\u00a0determine which schools are allowed to participate in federal student aid programs, which distribute billions in student loans and grants.",
      "The executive order directs the Department of Education to \"hold accountable\" any college accreditors that \"fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate Federal law\" \u2014 including by terminating or suspending the accreditors' federal recognition. It specifically singles out accrediting agencies that require schools to \"engage in unlawful discrimination ... under the guise of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' initiatives.\" The order also says the Department of Education should start recognizing new college accreditors.",

      "\"The basic idea is to force accreditation to be focused on the merit and the actual results that these universities are providing, as opposed to how woke these universities have gotten,\" Scharf said ahead of Mr. Trump signing the executive order. \"So we're setting up new accreditation pathways, we're charging the Department of Education to really look holistically at this accreditation mess and hopefully make it much better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wanted to know if the executive order he was signing will \"look into\" people who he says go to prestigious schools like Harvard or Princeton but can't do basic math.",
      "\"Will we look into the past people that they've taken?\" Mr. Trump asked Scharf. \"For instance, I hear all about certain great schools. And then we read where they're going to teach people basic math, math that we can all do very easily, but they can't do there.\"",
      "\"When universities are not performing appropriately, whether that's in admission or whether that's in their actual instructional activities, that's certainly something that accreditors should be considering that right now we believe they're not doing a good enough job of,\" Scharf responded.",
      "The president also signed an executive order charging federal departments and agencies to make sure universities are following the law in disclosing the acceptance of large foreign gifts.",
      "\"We believe that certain universities, including, for example, Harvard, have routinely violated this law and this law has not been effectively enforced,\" Scharf said. \"So this executive order charges your departments and agencies with enforcing the laws on the books with respect to foreign gifts to American universities.\"",
      "Scharf didn't offer evidence or details on how Harvard has allegedly violated the foreign gift disclosure law. Harvard told CBS News in a statement it has filed foreign gift reporting reports \"for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law.\"",
      "Harvard University on Monday announced it filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Tensions have escalated between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership. Several other schools, including Columbia University, have faced similar funding freezes, with the Trump administration alleging the schools have responded inadequately to antisemitism.",
      "The president on Wednesday also signed executive actions to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), make sure schoolchildren are adequately trained in artificial intelligence, boost apprenticeships and allow educators to enforce school discipline policies.",

The impending cuts are most likely to be felt by workers outside of Washington, D.C., already reeling from the decimation of their livelihoods and fields.",
      "USAID provided federal funding to hundreds of companies, organizations and universities to help run programs and research dedicated to various aspects of foreign aid. These companies employed people around the country, many of whom have already been furloughed, and are now finding out their positions have been eliminated.",
      "USAIDstopwork, a website tracking the economic impact of the USAID funding cuts, determined that\u00a019,187 American jobs\u00a0have been lost as of Wednesday. The tracker found\u00a0a total of 46 states were affected by job cuts and that, outside of Maryland and Virginia, some of the most impacted states were North Carolina, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and California. In Georgia, for example, USAID funded 18 organizations that ran 79 programs, and 44 of those programs were shuttered, leading to layoffs and an estimated loss of $257.9 million.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently ordered modifications to a room next to the Pentagon press briefing room to retrofit it with a makeup studio that can be used to prepare for television appearances, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The price tag for the project was several thousand dollars, according to two of the sources, at a time when the administration is searching for cost-cutting measures.",
      "\"Changes and upgrades to the Pentagon Briefing Room are nothing new and routinely happen during changes in an administration,\" a Defense Department spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The renovation that was initially planned was estimated to cost more than $40,000, but the ideas were scaled back, sources said.",
      "After CBS News published its report, the defense secretary responded in a post on X, \"Totally fake story. No 'orders' and no 'makeup.'\"",
      "Hegseth, before becoming defense secretary, was a morning show co-host on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends Weekend.\" Since his nomination, he has vowed to emphasize improvements in the armed forces' warfighting abilities and military readiness.",

      "The table was removed and a new chair and large mirror with makeup lighting was installed, another source said.",
      "Hegseth is doing his own makeup ahead of TV appearances, not paying for a makeup artist, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement and a former producer for Fox News and for CBS News, according to multiple sources. The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, and the defense secretary's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, also a former Fox producer, expressed their approval for the upgrade before it was undertaken, one of the sources said.",
      "The Defense Department spokesperson said the green room will be available to senior leaders and VIPs prior to press engagements.",
      "The new items, including a director's chair, came from existing inventories, the spokesperson said. A new countertop was constructed by facilities services staff.",
      "\"For this upgrade we were deliberately conservative and opted for several less expensive, on-hand materiel solutions,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Hegseth hasn't used the press room to brief reporters. But it has been a set for his TV appearances, including one with Fox this week in which he blamed the media and former Defense Department employees for the revelation that he sent sensitive details about military strikes in a Signal group chat that he created.",
      "He did not deny news reports that he shared real-time operational information with family members before strikes in Yemen were carried out. He didn't explain why his wife, who is not a Defense Department employee, was in the text chat. That was the second Signal group with whom Hegseth shared planning details about the Houthi airstrikes, which took place in mid-March. The first Signal chat, a principals group which comprised top national security officials, was created by national security adviser Michael Waltz, and its existence was exposed by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the group in error by Waltz.",
      "Hegseth claims he did not disclose classified information in either of the chat groups. The Defense Department acting inspector general is reviewing his disclosures.",
      "\"We're focused on recruiting, on rooting out DEI, on securing our southwest border, on the president's agenda, and it's going very well at the Pentagon, and I'm proud of it,\" Hegseth said Tuesday on Fox.",
      "The Pentagon restricted access to its briefing room on Feb. 21, barring reporters unless officials were speaking. Previously, press could use the room, one of the few places they could connect to Wi-Fi in the secure building, to file stories and to conduct on-camera reports.",

Lauren Underwood, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and 8th District U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi.",
      "Colleagues pay tribute to Durbin's career",
      "A number of legislators took time Wednesday morning to share tributes to Durbin's long career in politics.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a fellow Democrat, praised Durbin \"for his exemplary career of public service as well as the profound and lasting positive impact he's had on Illinois families and our nation.\" He added:",
      "\"Known for his legendary work ethic, Senator Durbin has led the fight to expand access to affordable health care, invest in our state's infrastructure, tackle gun violence, defend Dreamers, improve public health, protect working families, and more. His expert leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee ensured the confirmation of a record 235 federal judges, shaping the courts and securing our most fundamental American rights for many years to come.\"",
      "Speaking at an event in Decatur, Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker honored Durbin, saying, \"Let's all recognize someone serving us for decades in Washington D.C., representing the state of Illinois with enormous integrity and honor, is something we should all appreciate no matter what political party someone belongs to.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said Durbin \"has given Illinois a lifetime of principled leadership \u2014 grounded in decency, driven by purpose, and always guided by the people he served,\" and added \"Illinois is stronger because of him and the work he's championed will carry on.\"",
      "Rep. Delia Ramirez, a colleague and fellow Democrat, called Durbin a \"trusted leader, a mentor to many, and a champion for working people in Illinois.\"",
      "\"As he announces his much-deserved retirement, I am feeling thankful for his work and service to the people of Illinois and our nation,\" she wrote. \"Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to learn from you and partner with you on so many important issues. As the proud daughter of immigrants, the spouse of a Dreamer, and the Congresswoman of IL-03, I also extend my deepest gratitude for your unwavering commitment to defending our immigrant communities.\"",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson thanked Durbin for \"over 40 years of fighting for the people of Illinois.\" He called him a \"principled and pragmatic leader,\" praised his bipartisanship and his work in the senate.",
      "\"Time and time again, he delivered real results to the working people of Chicago \u2013 investing in our airports and our train stations, defending Dreamers and immigrants, and fighting to end gun violence. He was a champion for young children and early childhood education, and he fought for mental health services for our young people,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"Our city, our state, and our country are stronger due to his decades of service.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama, who served alongside Durbin in the Senate before his presidential run, also released a statement on the decision, writing, \"As an Illinois voter, I couldn't be prouder that our senator for the last 28 years has been one of the finest in the country. Dick Durbin has always fought the good fight on behalf of working families, and his integrity shines through in everything he does.\"",
      "With Durbin vacating his Senate seat, many prominent Democrats are expected to throw their hat in the ring. CBS News Chicago Political Analyst and former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said it's not impossible that a Republican could win the seat.",
      "\"I think that is a very remote possibility, given the nature of electorate here in Illinois, but I will sound a cautionary note. President Trump did very well not only across Illinois south of I-80, but made inroads in Cook County and DuPage County, and quite frankly did better than expected in the city of Chicago,\" she said.",
      "Lightfoot said she has no plans to run for the seat herself.",
      "\"No, I don't see that happening,\" she said. \"I can tell you private citizen Lightfoot is just fine where I am.\"",
      "Political scientist and professor Stephen Caliendo said there's more than meets the eye behind many of the statements from politicians in response to this announcement today.",
      "\"Part of what you're seeing with the praise for Senator Durbin, not to suggest at all that it's not authentic, but it's also seeking his blessing,\" he said. \"I don't know that he would come forward with a specific endorsement. Certainly not this early in a race, he wouldn't, but anybody who runs would love to have him alongside them on the campaign trail.\"",
      "Caliendo said November 2026 really isn't far away, and the race for campaign money has really already started. He believes several members of Congress from Illinois could run, with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi holding a huge fundraising lead, with more than $18 million on hand in his campaign fund.",
      "\"He's been hoarding money for some time, and the others have been in a little bit tighter races for their seats, so they've had to spend a little bit more in recent campaigns, but he's been collecting money and certainly the suggestion would be that he was desiring a higher office,\" Caliendo said.",
      "Rep. Lauren Underwood has more than $1 million available in her campaign fund after raising nearly $400,000 between January and March, mostly from individual contributions. Rep. Robin Kelly has more than $2 million I her campaign fund, after raising more than $185,000 between January and March, also nearly all of it from individual contributions.",
      "Stratton also is considered a likely Senate candidate now that Durbin is retiring. She has less than $100,000 in her campaign fund, but can't use it for a Senate race since the money was raised for a state race, not a federal race. However, she could potentially get significant financial backing from Pritzker, a billionaire who hasn't been shy about spending big to support political allies.",

      "President Trump has repeatedly shared an image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos in an effort to link the Maryland man, who was mistakenly deported\u00a0to El Salvador on March 15, to the notorious MS-13 gang.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump again shared a photo of Abrego Garcia's left hand on social media, alleging he \"had 'MS-13' tattooed onto his knuckles.\" The image shows the characters \"M,\" \"S,\" \"1\" and \"3\" digitally added above Abrego Garcia's existing tattoos \u2014 a leaf, a smiley face, a cross and a skull \u2014 along with labels describing each symbol beneath.",
      "Many people online recognized the labels as digitally added, but some alleged they were designed to appear as part of Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos and accused the Trump administration of trying to mislead the public. The White House has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the image and who added the labels.",
      "The experts and researchers we spoke with acknowledged the tattoos could carry gang-related symbolism, but they said the markings alone are not reliable indicators of membership. They also cast doubt on Trump's claims that the marijuana leaf represents an \"M,\" the smiley face \"S,\" the cross \"1\" and the skull \"3.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has no criminal record and his family says he was never involved with a gang.",
      "He was deported and sent to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, designed to hold the most dangerous gang members, before being moved to another facility as his case attracted widespread attention. As legal efforts to bring him back to the U.S. continue, the Trump administration has cited Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos as evidence of alleged MS-13 affiliation.",
      "Roberto Lovato, an assistant professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose memoir chronicled growing up in California during MS-13's early years, said although symbols are \"notoriously difficult to interpret,\" he does not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos are suggestive of MS-13 membership.",
      "Lovato also said current gang members he has spoken to do not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos represent MS-13.",
      "Maya Barak, an associate professor of criminal justice studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, told CBS News that tattoos such as devil horns, the letters \"M\" and \"S\" and the numbers \"1\" and \"3\" have been used by MS-13 members. The National Gang Center and FBI both cited variations of \"MS,\" \"13\" and devil horns as tattoos associated with MS-13.",
      "A community activist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told CBS News he has worked with gang members for more than 25 years and has never seen a series of finger tattoos like Abrego Garcia's linked to MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration's \"border czar\" Tom Homan told ABC News \"you can't ignore a tattoo\" but said people are not being labeled as gang members strictly based on their tattoos.",

      "\"I'm not aware of any statutory framework that relies just on tattoos or honestly on any one single aspect,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Lovato agreed that using the tattoos alone as evidence \"would not hold water in a court of law.\"",
      "Kennedy also noted the transient nature of gang membership as another hurdle to identifying active members.",
      "\"Even if we take the tattoos to be indicative of MS-13 membership, that's very often not a permanent status and people stop being involved [in the gang],\" Kennedy said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin announced Wednesday he won't seek reelection in 2026, kickstarting a race for his long-held seat representing Illinois \u2014 and a broader shakeup of Democratic leadership in the Senate.",
      "Durbin, 80, has served since 2005 as the Democratic whip, the second-ranking position in Democratic leadership. First under former Democratic leader Harry Reid and now under Chuck Schumer, the Illinois Democrat has shepherded the caucus through votes, while being a prominent voice on the leadership team for two decades.",
      "After the 2026 elections, the whip position will be up for grabs. And the announcement has spurred whispers about a possible successor.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz's name has been floated as being among the list of Democrats who could take up the mantle. Schatz has represented Hawaii in the Senate since 2012, and currently serves as chief deputy whip. Schatz celebrated Durbin's career in a statement Wednesday, calling the Illinois Democrat a \"mentor and friend.\"",
      "Other members of the Senate Democratic leadership could also vie for the No. 2 post. The caucus elevated Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to the No. 3 position in Senate leadership in the last internal elections, along with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to the fourth-ranking post. Both are possible candidates for the whip role, though they each sought the Democratic nomination for the White House in 2020, and could have ambitions beyond the Senate in 2028. The caucus conducts leadership elections behind closed doors before the start of each new Congress.",
      "Durbin's retirement also opens up the coveted top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he's been the top Democrat since 2021. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, is widely expected to take his place at the top of the panel.",
      "The Illinois Democrat's announcement of his planned departure comes months after the bruising 2024 election, where Democrats lost power in the White House and the Senate \u2014 leading some members of the party to call for a new generation of leadership to come forward. And a broader shakeup remains possible, especially as questions about Schumer's leadership have continued to swirl, though they've died down considerably in recent weeks.",
      "Facing the threat of a government shutdown in March, Schumer, who's led the caucus since 2017, delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel a GOP-led funding measure to passage after he had initially pledged to oppose it. The move prompted intense frustration among his party, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision, arguing that a shutdown would have been worse than the funding measure for the nation, delivering sole power to the executive branch.",
      "Democrats had widely opposed the measure and expressed frustration with its spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. Some progressives suggested that a shutdown was a better alternative, while others simply took issue with Schumer's changing stance. But in the end, nine Democrats and independents also voted to advance the measure, including Schumer's No. 2, Durbin \u2014 and Schatz.",
      "As attention is now turning to Senate Democratic leadership, Senate Republicans elected a new slate after the 2024 elections, tapping Sen. John Thune to lead the conference after Sen. Mitch McConnell opted to step down after 17 years at the helm.",

      "Jose Hermosillo was arrested on April 8 by CBP in Tucson and detained for 10 days. His family provided documentation proving his American citizenship, days after being taken into custody, according to court records and Department of Homeland Security assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.",
      "On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security argued his arrest, which has attracted national attention, was a \"direct result of his own actions and statements.\" A DHS spokesperson said Hermosillo approached a Border Patrol agent, said he had entered the U.S. illegally and identified himself as a Mexican citizen.",
      "The department also posted a copy of Hermosillo's sworn statement on X in which Hermosillo responded \"yes\" when asked if he had entered the U.S. illegally. The document shows a child-like signature that reads \"Jose.\"",

He left his girlfriend's relative's home and wandered away during the night, and it was during this walk that Hermosillo was detained by CBP, his parents said.",
      "Details of the arrest remain unclear. The initial April 9 criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Arizona by a Border Patrol agent says Hermosillo was found \"at or near Nogales, Arizona without the proper immigration documents.\" The document referred to Hermosillo as an \"alien\" and charged him with \"improper entry,\" a misdemeanor offense.",
      "But DHS later stated that he was arrested in Tucson. According to court documents, Hermosillo told the judge he was a U.S. citizen during his first appearance. A day later, Hermosillo's U.S. birth certificate was made available to the judge.",
      "When CBS News spoke with Hermosillo, he appeared to be distraught and confused. He said he cried every night at the detention center, describing it as a very cold place filled with sick people who were constantly coughing.",
      "\"When I sleep, I dream that I'm still detained,\" Hermosillo said over the phone in Spanish.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to a CBS News request to comment on the allegations by Hermosillo and his parents, including about his intellectual disabilities.",
      "Hermosillo's mother said she was hospitalized after her son was detained because of the stress it caused.",
      "\"I cried every day,\" she said. \"I just wanted them to let him go.\"",

      "The Hermosillo family was able to locate their son at a detention center in Florence, Arizona. On April 17, a Tucson magistrate judge dismissed Hermosillo's criminal case. He was released the next day.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the court-appointed lawyer who represented Hermosillo. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her office is looking into his case.",

      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",

Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",

Harry was attending the event with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",

    "story": [
      "Scammers are using artificial intelligence to alter their appearance and build fake profiles to apply for remote job postings, research shows.",
      "Already, scammers can use AI at almost every step in the job application process to hide their true identities. They can generate fake resumes, professional headshots, websites and Linkedin profiles. Compiled together, AI can help create what looks like the perfect candidate for an open role.",
      "Once they're in, these fraudsters can steal company secrets or install malware.",
      "While identity theft is not new, AI is helping scammers scale their operations, and the problem is growing. According to research and advisory firm Gartner,\u00a0an estimated one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028.",
      "How to spot a fake",
      "A recording of an interview with what appeared to be an AI-generated job seeker went viral on LinkedIn, posted by Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Vidoc Security. He told CBS News he was shocked when he realized what was happening.",
      "\"I felt a little bit violated, because we are the security experts,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "Moczadlo said when he suspected the person was using an AI filter, he asked a simple question: \"Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face?\"",
      "When they refused, Moczadlo immediately ended the interview. He explained that the software the scammer was using didn't seem sophisticated, so blocking the person's face with their hand would likely \"break\" the deepfake face filter.",
      "\"Sometimes it takes a hacker to find a hacker,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "This was the second time the company had interviewed someone who turned out to be AI-generated. Moczadlo said it completely changed the company's hiring process. Now, potential employees are flown in for a one-day, in-person interview. The company covers travel and pays for a full day of work. It believes the extra cost is worth the peace of mind.",
      "A pattern of deception",
      "These incidents aren't isolated. The Justice Department has uncovered multiple networks in which North Koreans used fake identities to land remote jobs in the U.S. They often use AI to build fake identities and work U.S.-based IT jobs to funnel U.S. dollars to their home country.",
      "The Justice Department estimates these schemes generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with much of those funds going directly to the North Korean Ministry of Defense and the country's nuclear missile program.",
      "Moczadlo said researchers told him Vidoc's fake job seekers followed a similar pattern to several of these North Korean networks, though Vidoc's incident is still under investigation.",
      "\"We are really lucky that we are security experts.\" Moczadlo added, \"but for companies that have regular people like hiring managers or regular startup founders, it's really hard for them to spot something like this.\"",
      "The reaction inspired Vidoc's co-founders to build a guide to help HR professionals across industries spot potentially fraudulent applicants.",
      "If you're wondering if this has ever happened to you, the CBS News Confirmed team has compiled some general best-practices to check that the person you're speaking to is real:",
      "1. Look closer at their LinkedIn profile: While the profile might look legitimate at first glance, check the creation date by clicking on the \"More\" button and then selecting \"About this profile.\" You can also check that the person has connections at the places they say they've worked.",
      "2. Ask cultural questions: If someone says they grew up in a specific country or city, ask about things only a local might know, like their favorite cafes and restaurants.",
      "3. In-person is best: At the end of the day, especially as AI technology advances, the only way to really know that a person is who they say they are, is to meet them face-to-face.",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",

      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

      "She also criticized Bondi for posting on\u00a0social media\u00a0that the federal prosecutors would seek the death penalty for Mangione.",
      "\"It's state-sanctioned murder. He's a political prisoner,\" she said. \"School shooters don't get it. Dylann Roof \u2014 like politically motivated, racially motivated shooters don't get the death penalty.\"",
      "During the arraignment, Judge Margaret Garnett asked prosecutors to convey a message to Bondi, reminding her that public commentary can impact a fair trial.",
      "Another woman, who wore a facemask, arrived at 6:15 a.m. to line up.",
      "\"I think this may be one of the biggest constitutional cases of our time,\" she said, lamenting the \"extent to which [Luigi has] been portrayed as guilty,\" and expressing concern about finding an impartial jury.",
      "\"Everyone will have an opinion,\" she declared.",
      "Mangione was shackled as he was led into the packed courtroom, wearing a tan and white prison outfit, a stark\u00a0contrast from his last court appearance when he wore a preppy green cable knit sweater over a white collared shirt with khakis - and a bulletproof vest. Then there was tension between the prosecution and defense over whether he was receiving \"special treatment\" after two heart-shaped notes were hidden in the packaging of argyle socks that Mangione was given to wear to the hearing.",
      "One read: \"Know there are thousands of people wishing you luck.\" Mangione ultimately went sockless with his loafers to that hearing. Prosecutors wrote in a court document that \"he felt that 'they did not look good.'\"",
      "In court on Friday, Mangione sat between his lawyers Marc Agnifilo and Avraham Moskowitz, who specializes in the death penalty and was recently added to the team.\u00a0Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who is married to Mr. Agnifilo took the lead in court. Mangione spoke animatedly with his lawyers before the arraignment started. He seemed attentive throughout, watching the judge intently and peering to look at the prosecution as each spoke. He took notes and leaned back pensively holding his pen at moments.",
      "With two impending trials in New York, the question of which will proceed first has not yet been resolved. The prosecution indicated that they planned for the New York State trial to proceed first since thus is a capital case, while the defense argued for starting with the federal trial due to concerns about \"constitutional issues\" that could be impacted.",
      "\"We will set the schedule for this case as though it is the only case,\" said Judge Garnett, \"until circumstances project otherwise.\" She said the trial date would be set at the next conference on December 5th and should take place in 2026.",
      "When the court wrapped, he appeared to be in a good mood and turned to face the rows of public and press as he conferred with his attorneys. He made eye contact and smiled as they filed out.",
      "Thompson is survived by his wife, Paulette Thompson, and two children, who have remained out of the spotlight after releasing a\u00a0statement in December\u00a0saying, \"Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former U.S. Rep. George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges Friday in New York.",
      "The judge handed down the maximum sentence of 87 months just before noon in Central Islip on Long Island.",
      "Federal prosecutors say the former congressman exaggerated or fabricated large parts of his backstory to defraud voters and donors in New York's 3rd Congressional District. He faced nearly a dozen criminal charges before\u00a0pleading guilty to two counts last August.",
      "U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York John Durham spoke to reporters after the sentencing and called Santos' crimes an \"affront to our electoral process, our representative government and the people of New York's 3rd Congressional District.\"",
      "\"But today, finally, Santos has been held accountable for his years of fraud, deceit and theft. He's going to federal prison and he's going to be punished for his staggering fraud, for the abuses he put on our electoral process, for mocking our democratic institutions and, most importantly, for betraying and defrauding his supporters, his voters, his donors, federal agencies, state agencies,\" Durham said outside the courthouse. \"Today's sentence demonstrates that this egregious conduct will not, and never will be, tolerated.\"",
      "\"Come July 25th, George Santos will finally be where he belongs \u2013 behind bars, answering for these crimes,\" Nassau District Attorney Anne Donnelly said.",
      "CBS News reached Santos by phone as he was driving to court Friday morning, and he said he was resigned to the fact the judge could impose a stiff sentence. He said he had no expectations about the judge's decision or when he would have to report to prison. Santos has said he will not beg for a pardon.",
      "The 36-year-old walked into the courthouse through a crush of reporters and photographers. He was seen hugging supporters and looking very somber, with bloodshot eyes, as he went inside.",
      "At sentencing, the federal judge said, \"Where is your remorse? It's always someone else's fault.\"",
      "Santos read a statement to the judge, saying through tears he was humbled and that he shattered the faith of many people. He offered his deepest apologies and admitted that he betrayed his supporters and the institutions he was sworn to serve. He went on to say he cannot rewrite the past but he asked for a balanced sentence, adding he can contribute to the community he wronged.",
      "He was later seen leaving the courthouse with his attorneys. It's unclear when he will report for his sentence.",
      "Outside, a crowd of his former constituents gathered with signs that read \"Truth Matters\" and \"We Refuse to Be Deceived Again.\"",
      "\"My reaction in sitting in the courtroom was 'cry me a river,'\" said Jody Kass Finkel, with Concerned Citizens of NY-03.",
      "A few fans were in the courtroom, as well.",
      "\"Donald Trump will commute his sentence, and he should. And he should,\" Santos supporter David Rem said.",
      "Santos asked for leniency ahead of sentencing",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Santos to serve 87 months in prison, while his lawyers sought just 24 months.",
      "In a recent filing, the DOJ said he remains \"unrepentant for his crimes\" and pointed to various social media posts it said are \"hardly an expression of 'genuine remorse.'\"",
      "Santos wrote to the judge earlier this week asking for leniency and saying he accepts responsibility.",
      "\"This case has cost me my congressional seat, my reputation, my livelihood, and, most painful of all, the confidence of people who believed in me. Every sunrise since that plea has carried the same realization: I did this, me. I am responsible,\" Santos wrote. \"But saying I'm sorry doesn't require me to sit quietly while these prosecutors try to drop an anvil on my head.\"",
      "He previously told his followers he plans to request solitary confinement in prison.",
      "Santos was part of \"red wave\" for Republican party",
      "Santos helped Republicans secure the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections, representing New York's 3rd Congressional District\u00a0which covers parts of Queens and Nassau County.",
      "Before he was even sworn into office, his lies started to untangle.",
      "Federal investigators filed\u00a0the first charges against Santos in May 2023, followed by\u00a0additional charges that October. The House Ethics Committee released a scathing 56-page report the next month, detailing the scope of his misconduct.",
      "Santos was\u00a0ousted from Congress weeks later, becoming just\u00a0the sixth House member to be expelled\u00a0in U.S. history.",
      "What did George Santos do?",
      "In a\u00a0sentencing memo filed earlier this month, prosecutors said he \"made a mockery of our election system,\" adding he didn't just pad his resume, he used \"a wholly fictitious biography to enrich himself and capture one of the highest offices.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Santos presented false financial disclosures to congress claiming he was a multi-millionaire and solicited a vendor to forge a Baruch College diploma.",
      "In the sentencing memo, they wrote these were \"intentional and bald-faced lies\" of a \"professional fraudster\" -- \"a fictitious public image of a highly educated, independently wealthy businessman.\"",
      "\"He admitted to engaging in a brazen crime spree that took place over a period of years. He stole personal identities and financial information from campaign contributors, made unauthorized transfers of money to his campaign and to himself personally,\" Durham said Friday. \"He defrauded prospective political supporters by convincing them to make campaign contributions based on false statements, and then took the money for himself.",
      "\"He lied to receive unemployment benefits when he was not entitled to them because he had a job. He lied to the Federal Election Commission about the amount of money his campaign had brought in, and he used that to trick the National Republican Congressional Committee into giving his campaign money it was not entitled to,\" Durham continued. \"And he lied to congress on his financial disclosure forms.\"",
      "The sentencing memo outlined fake donations in the names of relatives, a credit card fraud scheme that stole from elderly and cognitively impaired donors to buy designer goods, and another that created a fake nonprofit to solicit donations.",
      "It also said Santos claimed he loaned his campaign $500,000 when he had less than $10,000 to his name, and that he collected unemployment benefits while working for a firm that was later exposed as a Ponzi scheme.",
      "\"From the moment he declared his candidacy for congress, Santos leveraged his campaign for his own enrichment and financial benefit,\" said Durham. \"He did this by targeting specific supporters and constituents. He saw them as easy marks and he made them victims of his fraud.\"",
      "\"It wasn't a mistake. It wasn't an oops. It wasn't 'I don't know what I'm doing.' It's very clear when you steal money from UI,\" said Roberta Reardon, commissioner of the New York State Department of Labor.",
      "As part of his plea deal, he agreed to pay more than $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture.",

Giuffre filed a lawsuit against Andrew in 2021, alleging that she was sexually abused by Andrew when she was 17. An out-of-court settlement was reached in 2022.",

      "Markey also noted that the Trump administration has moved to shield corporate giants such as Apple and Google from the impact of some its trade policies, and he pressed the White House to protect small businesses. The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",

      "Patel said that the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, was later arrested and is currently being detained.",
      "Dugan was arrested at 8 a.m. on Friday at the courthouse where she works, according to a federal law enforcement source. She was charged with two counts of obstruction and released from detention after making an initial appearance in federal court.",
      "According to a sworn statement by an FBI agent, Flores-Ruiz was deported from the United States in 2013 and illegally reentered the U.S. During this period, Flores-Ruiz was accused of committing battery.",
      "After a fingerprint match from Flores-Ruiz's first arrest in 2013 and a local case in Milwaukee, a warrant for his arrest and deportation was issued by ICE.",
      "While Flores-Ruiz was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a criminal court appearance, law enforcement waited outside of her courtroom to arrest him on an administrative warrant.",

      "\"Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,\" the agent wrote. Dugan, according to witnesses, told the arrest team to go to the chief judge's office to speak with them about the permissibility of making the arrest inside the courthouse, and looked around the hallway near her courtroom to seek out other law enforcement officers who were waiting to arrest Flores-Ruiz.",
      "One agent, who Dugan did not recognize as part of the arrest team, remained in the hallway waiting for Flores-Ruiz.",

      "Prior to Dugan's arrest, President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, told CBS News in an interview that interference with deportations is considered \"evading arrest.\"",
      "\"So we got a lot of, in my opinion, some radical judges who are trying to stop what we're doing,\" Homan said. \"Then you got, you know, NGOs out there, and you got congressional representatives like AOC (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and the rest of 'the Squad,' saying they're going to educate people to their constitutional rights on not opening the door for others.\"",
      "Homan went on: \"We all know that it's about evading arrest. Don't open your door when ICE comes to your door. You have an order of deportation issued by a federal judge. If you and I ignored that order, we'd be in jail. But you've got members of Congress out there saying, 'You don't have to open the door for ICE, they need a warrant. You don't have to talk to ICE.' It's just, we all know what the end game is. The end game is, yeah, you can call it educating constitutional rights. Don't disagree. But we all know what the end game is: evade arrest, put off the arrest. So, that is hurting. But real soon, people are going to see that that's no longer going to work.\"",
      "When questioned about the issue of due process for immigrants, Homan responded, \"They get due process, everyone gets due process.\"",
      "Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, called the arrest a \"gravely serious and drastic move\" in a statement on social media. \"While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President's lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress's checks on his power,\" Baldwin said.",

    "summary": "\"We are not creating an autism registry,\" a Department of Health and Human Services official said in a statement.",
    "story": [
      "A Department of Health and Human Services official said Friday that the health department is not creating an autism registry, contradicting an announcement made days ago by the director of the National Institutes of Health describing his plans to study causes of autism.",
      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",
      "Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims.",
      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said.",
      "\"These efforts are not about tracking individuals. All NIH-managed databases follow the highest standards of security and privacy, with the protection of personal health information as a top priority,\" the NIH said.",
      "The HHS statement marks the latest change to Kennedy's autism research effort in recent weeks, since he first announced the push at a White House meeting earlier this month.",
      "Bhattacharya told reporters earlier this week that he anticipated grant funding for the autism research would \"hopefully\" be awarded by September. That is later than the initial timeline outlined by Kennedy, who has said that \"by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.\"",
      "\"It's hard to guarantee when science will make an advance. It depends on, you know, nature has its say,\" Bhattacharya has said.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:07:39 -0400",
    "summary": "The push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal funding will cost taxpayers money, nonpartisan group finds. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new analysis from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year.",
      "The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",
      "PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiple lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS.",
      "DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept a deferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since been rehired after a court ruling.",
      "Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such as bird flu experts\u00a0who were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting their weekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\"",
      "\"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect.",
      "The White House took issue with the analysis.",
      "\"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\"",
      "Why job cuts could raise costs",
      "The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly\u00a040% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated.",
      "But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. One analysis by researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost.",
      "\"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said.",
      "DOGE's \"wall of receipts\"",
      "DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on its\u00a0website in what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, a February CBS News investigation found.",
      "At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which President Trump has vowed not to touch.",
      "Musk said Tuesday that he'll curtail his work at DOGE starting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work.",
      "Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste.",
      "\"I'll have to continue to keep doing it for the remainder of the president's term to make sure the waste and fraud doesn't come roaring back,\" he said during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.",

    "summary": "Prices on thousands of of goods sold on Amazon, Temu and Shein are rising as U.S. tariffs on China boost import costs.",
    "story": [
      "American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, especially online.",
      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%, according to the company's analysis.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone chargers to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"Amazon consistently offers the lowest prices across the widest selection. We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",
      "Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan.",
      "Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quickly\u00a0denied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation.",

      "Americans are having fewer babies, with the annual birth rate now standing near a record low. It's a trend that has implications for the nation's long-term outlook \u2014 and has drawn attention from the Trump administration, with the New York Times reporting that a proposal for a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" may be one option for juicing the birth rate.",
      "\"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" President Trump said on Tuesday at a White House event when asked about the possibility of a federal baby bonus.",
      "Yet the idea may be far from becoming a reality, with a White House official telling CBS MoneyWatch that no final decision on such a plan has been made.",
      "A declining birth rate can spell long-term economic problems, including a shrinking labor force that's financially strapped to pay for medical services and retirement benefits for an aging population. But reversing a nation's declining birth rate could take far more than a one-time payment that, for most parents, would be quickly consumed by the costs of diapers, child care and other essentials.",
      "Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried an array of strategies to revive their birth rates, but in most cases with short-lived results or no impact at all.",
      "Some experts point out that by tackling long-standing economic issues \u2014 such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave after the birth of a child \u2014 the government could provide a more hospitable environment for families. The U.S. is one of a only a handful of nations that doesn't provide paid leave for parents, including countries such as Papua New Guinea and Suriname.",
      "\"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\"",
      "By 2050, 26 states will take an economic hit due to their aging populations changes, with GDP declining by $162.3 billion from 2050 to 2100 over that period, according to a new analysis from PwC. Those states range from Maine to Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about baby bonuses.",
      "How much has the U.S. birth rate declined?",
      "About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hit a new record low.",
      "The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "What's causing the decline?",
      "That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022\u00a0analysis of the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact.",
      "But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\"",
      "Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote.",
      "Could financial incentives increase the birth rate?",
      "Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success.",
      "Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000.",
      "After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011.",
      "But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic data shows.",
      "\"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post.",
      "How much does it cost to raise a child?",
      "Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recent analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.",
      "How would a U.S. baby bonus work?",
      "Typically such incentives are paid either through a tax credit or a government check, similar to the stimulus checks that were given to millions of households during the pandemic.",
      "Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit.",
      "\"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born \u2014 there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in a recent post at the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\"",
      "How much would a $5,000 baby bonus cost the U.S.?",
      "If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. stocks wavered on Friday, signaling an end to a three-day rally that was driven by investor hopes of a de-escalation in the trade war.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20 points, or 0.1%, to close at 40,114, while the S&P 500 added 40 points, or 0.7%, to close at 5,525. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3% thanks to boost from a handful of Big Tech stocks, including Nvidia.",
      "Mr. Trump had adopted a softer stance on trade in recent days, allaying investors' concerns and helping trigger a three-day relief rally following a volatile trading day on Monday. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research note that negative activity in the market played a \"key role\" in the president's decision to reconsider his steep tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which currently total 145%.",
      "Meanwhile, the markets are also reacting to mixed signals from the White House about potential trade deals.",
      "Mr. Trump this week hinted at a possible trade deal with China, but the Chinese government has denied the two countries are in\u00a0active negotiations.\u00a0CNN did report\u00a0that China was rolling back the 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. semiconductors, a sign it could be relaxing its stance.",
      "\"We're in a headline driven market, and we're prone to volatility spikes and outsized trading ranges in both directions,\" said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"And you know, it's probably going to remain that type of market until we at least have more clarity on what's going on.\"",
      "In a Time interview released Friday morning, Mr. Trump suggested his administration has struck 200 trade deals with countries, and that those would be announced in the next three to four weeks.",
      "CEOs: \"Elevated uncertainty\"",
      "On Thursday and Friday, several companies cautioned that uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's trade war is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year.",
      "Intel weighed on the market after the chip company said it's seeing \"elevated uncertainty across the industry\" and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 6.8% even though its results for the beginning of the year topped expectations.",
      "Eastman Chemical fell 5.9% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts' expectations. CEO Mark Costa said that the \"macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased\" and that future demand for its products \"is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs.\"",
      "Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 4.3%.",
      "Trade deals",
      "Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days \u2014 providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity.",
      "\"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note.",
      "Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts.",
      "Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this week\u00a0reported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say.",
      "\"The April 2 rose garden start on tariffs might have been the high water mark, but you're still talking about a significant burden that is being imposed on companies and the economy from tariffs,\" said Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at Vital Knowledge. \"And that's not going away.\"",
      "While the U.S. stock market lost some steam on Friday, an ease in 10-year Treasury yields and a rebound in U.S. dollar index provided welcome signs of relief. The 10-year Treasury fell from a peak of 4.4% earlier this week to 4.3% on Friday, while the value of the U.S. dollar ticked up to throughout the week, strengthening against the euro and other rival currencies.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly across much of Europe following more mixed movements in Asia. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9%, while stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.1%.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-economy-trump-ceo-lawsuit-learning-resources-ceo-rick-woldenberg/",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:19:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg says his tariff costs will surge more than 40-fold to $100 million, while sales could fall.",
    "story": [
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg thinks the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs will be catastrophic for both his family-owned toy business and for the broader U.S. economy. That's why he's suing President Trump.",
      "Woldenberg's business has 500 employees and sells thousands of learning-based toys like Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog and the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register. Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties. Congress has historically held the power to authorize new tariffs or make trade deals with other nations.",
      "With the administration's higher tariffs in place, the math is dire for Learning Resources, Woldenberg said. The company's import duties are set to increase from $2.3 million prior to the Trump administration to $100 million \u2014 a roughly 4,000% increase, he said.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic\"",
      "At the same time, Woldenberg said he expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year as consumers scale back spending due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's trade war, the CEO had forecast an 8% increase in sales. Economists on Wall Street\u00a0say the tariffs\u00a0will slow U.S. economic growth while boosting inflation.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic,\" Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Forces have been unleashed in the economy \u2014 the world economy as well as the U.S. economy \u2014 that will have consequences that will be irreparable.\"",
      "Learning Resources' suit asks the court to find that Mr. Trump's tariffs are unlawful and to block the administration from collecting the levies. Based in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Learning Resources is a private, family-owned business founded in 1984.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the suit or the company's financial challenges caused by the tariffs.",
      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",
      "\"They should go back to the way things were on January 19th and figure out another plan. This one is not working,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Avelo Airlines says it's counting on a new federal contract for deportation flights to help the discount carrier grow its regular passenger service.",
    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly four months into 2025, the United States recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, and the number continues to grow, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to at least\u00a0646, while cases nationwide have hit 884, with infections confirmed in at least 29 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Fridays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history\u00a0of making\u00a0false and misleading claims\u00a0about vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0spread in the Southwest.",
      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview April 8, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",

    "summary": "Shortening permitting procedures for mining and oil drilling could adversely affect the environment, communities and endangered species, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

    "summary": "Day 1 of the 2025 NFL Draft started with Cam Ward as the first pick, which marked the third straight year a quarterback went No. 1 overall. See the full results from the first round.",
    "story": [
      "The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in Thursday's NFL Draft, a drama-free move that had been predicted for weeks by football pundits. Speaking to the perceived lack of quarterback talent among the 2025 class, Ward was one of only two quarterbacks taken in the entire first round.",
      "But in a sign of the importance of the position, he becomes the third straight quarterback to go No. 1 overall, after the Chicago Bears selected USC's Caleb Williams with the first pick in 2024, and the Carolina Panthers selected Alabama's Bryce Young in 2023.",
      "The last non-quarterback to go No. 1 was Georgia defensive end Travon Walker in 2022, picked by the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
      "Although Ward was considered a virtual lock to go to the Titans, the rest of the draft was playing out as one of the most unpredictable in years.",
      "That unpredictability came to fruition almost immediately when, after Ward's selection, the Jacksonville Jaguars traded a haul \u2014 including the No. 5 pick \u2014 to the Cleveland Browns in order to move up to No. 2 and take two-way Colorado star Travis Hunter, who has expressed a desire to play both cornerback and receiver in the NFL as he did in college.",
      "The biggest surprise of the night was that Hunter's teammate \u2014 Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of NFL legend Deion Sanders \u2014 dropped out of the first round entirely after initial projections had him going as high as first overall.",
      "Unlike 2024's draft class, considered one of the most talent-laden in decades, 2025 doesn't have anywhere near as many blue-chip prospects, and forecasts on who might go where have been all over the map. A case-in-point being the Seattle Seahawks' selection of guard Grey Zabel at No. 18, who had been projected by most to go on day two.",
      "The overriding theme appeared to be the trenches. While an unprecedented six quarterbacks were taken in the first 12 picks in 2024, only one, Ward, was chosen in the top-12 Thursday. Seven of those first 12 were on the offensive and defensive lines.",
      "It wasn't until pick No. 25 that another quarterback was taken, with the New York Giants \u2014 who used the third overall pick on Penn State edge Abdul Carter \u2014 trading back into the first round to snag Jaxson Dart of Ole Miss. In stark contrast to the 2024 draft, Ward and Dart were the only two quarterbacks selected Thursday.",
      "For the first time ever, meanwhile, the draft was being held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, just outside Lambeau Field, the iconic home of the Packers.",

      "The lawsuit \"lays out a pattern of intimidation, manipulation, and abuse, including allegations that Sharpe repeatedly threatened to choke and slap Jane Doe,\" attorney Tony Buzbee said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The woman first met Sharpe at a gym in Los Angeles in 2023 when she was 20 and a nearly two-year relationship followed, according to court documents. Sharpe, 56, is accused of raping the woman in October 2024 and again in January, court documents said.",

      "There are other meat-eating caterpillars that \"do lots of crazy things, but this takes the cake,\" said study author Dan Rubinoff with the University of Hawaii at Manoa.",

    "summary": "Melody Farris says her son Scott Farris wanted to inherit the family farm and fortune. But a Georgia jury ruled that Melody was the real killer.",
    "story": [
      "When the charred remains of prominent commercial real estate attorney Gary Farris were discovered on a burn pile with a bullet lodged in a rib bone, detectives knew they were facing a homicide investigation. The crime scene was on a sprawling 10-acre property in Cherokee County, Georgia, where Gary Farris lived with his wife Melody and their son Scott.",
      "It was July 2018 when detectives found Gary Farris' blood and a second bullet in the basement of the home and questioned how his body could have ended up on the burn pile, about 50 yards away. Soon after their arrival on scene, investigators found themselves entangled in a family drama with mother and son pointing the finger at each other.",
      "\"This is a mother's worst nightmare \u2026 it has been called the Farris wheel, and it was, but it was our Farris wheel,\" Melody Farris tells \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant in an exclusive interview.",
      "Van Sant and \"48 Hours\" investigate the murder of Gary Farris in \"The Farris Wheel\" airing Saturday, April 26, at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Investigators learned Scott Farris was responsible for the day-to-day operations on the farm and that his work and personal expenses were covered by his father. According to Melody Farris, around the time of Gary Farris' death there was tension between him and Scott Farris, mainly about Scott needing to get another job. Scott Farris, however, says that is not true and tension in the home was caused by Melody Farris disappearing for weeks at a time and spending Gary Farris' money.",
      "Gary Farris was the sole bread winner and allowed Melody and Scott Farris access to accounts in his name. Scott Farris said his mother was away for extended periods of time because she was having an affair with her lover who lived in Tennessee.",
      "In June 2019, after an almost 12-month investigation, Melody Farris was arrested for the murder of Gary Farris.",
      "When her trial began in October 2024, her defense team said she was innocent and pointed the finger at Scott Farris. They said at his size, about 6 feet 8 inches, 280 pounds, he was more capable of moving Gary's 6-foot-4-inch, 300-pound body than his much smaller mother.",
      "But police and prosecutors believed Melody Farris was the murderer. Prosecutors argued, among other things, that Melody Farris was the only one home at the time they believe Gary Farris was killed. And at trial they called a witness from the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office Intelligence Division who analyzed phone records and discovered that Gary Farris' cellphone moved from the house to the burn pile and back to the house after investigators believe his body was already on the burn pile. Melody Farris was the only one home at that time as well.",
      "On Nov. 4, 2024, Melody Farris was found guilty of murdering her husband. She had not spoken publicly until her sentencing hearing a month later when she shocked the courtroom, saying, \"Not only did I not do this, I know who did. I know Scott killed his father.\"",
      "Immediately after Melody Farris was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years, she walked into an exclusive interview with Van Sant, where she continued to profess her innocence.",
      "Melody Farris told Van Sant she saw Scott Farris near the burn pile the morning before Gary Farris' body was discovered. She said she believes Scott Farris used his pickup truck to get Gary Farris' body to the burn pile. And she went as far as saying Scott Farris planted the bullet that was found in the basement to frame her. Melody Farris says she believes Scott Farris killed his father because he wanted the farm to be his and would refer to it as his property in conversation.",
      "Melody Farris told Van Sant, \"\u2026 it's the perfect murder. You kill your daddy. You set your mother up. She goes to prison. You get everything.\"",
      "Scott Farris also sat down with Van Sant and told him, \"I absolutely had nothing to do with my father's death. And it was 100% Melody Farris who murdered my father. That is the truth.\"",
      "Scott Farris says Melody Farris is the only one who wanted Gary Farris dead, and he never drove his truck near the burn pile. As for the bullet being planted, Scott Farris said, \"I didn't even know there was a bullet found in the basement until after she was arrested.\"",
      "Scott Farris says he was an easy target because he lived on the property with his parents and was former military. Investigators were able to rule him out as a suspect and he was not charged with anything relating to the death of his father.",
      "When asked if she was willing to sacrifice one of her children's lives to save herself, Melody Farris said, \"absolutely not.\" But Scott Farris says Melody Farris needs to stop with the lies and just come clean: \"she knows she did it.\"",

    "summary": "Ryan Hemphill is accused of raping six women over five months in a depraved rampage. Prosecutors believe there are more victims.",
    "story": [
      "A private equity executive turned his New York City apartment into a torture chamber of \"grotesque sexual violence,\" Manhattan prosecutors said Thursday. Ryan Hemphill is accused of raping six women over five months in a depraved rampage in which he allegedly punched, waterboarded and shocked victims with a cattle prod and kept recordings of the assaults as trophies.",
      "Hemphill, who remains jailed after his arrest last month, pleaded not guilty to a 116-count indictment charging him with predatory sexual assault and other crimes dating to last October. The 43-year-old, who is also a lawyer, threatened to have victims arrested or disappeared in a bid to keep them silent, prosecutors said.",
      "\"The defendant told these survivors that he was untouchable,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. \"The indictment makes clear that he was wrong.\"",
      "Hemphill sat quietly in a khaki jail suit, his cuffed hands clutching a cross behind his back, as a prosecutor described his alleged crimes in gruesome detail.",
      "If convicted, Hemphill could spend the rest of his life in prison. He was previously acquitted in 2015 of choking and holding a knife to his ex-girlfriend's throat after testifying that he enjoyed strangling her during sex.",
      "\"We have reason to believe these six victims are only the tip of the iceberg,\" Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Mirah Curzer told Judge Ann E. Scherzer.",
      "Hemphill's apartment, near the Empire State Building, was outfitted with numerous surveillance cameras, and investigators have recovered images showing dozens, if not hundreds, of other women, many of them naked and blindfolded, Curzer said.",
      "Investigators also found hundreds of bullets and high-capacity magazines, and a large amount of drugs, including heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and fentanyl, prosecutors said.",
      "In a news release, prosecutors posted images of other items they said were recovered from his apartment, including a cattle prod, handcuffs and fake cash. They also posted threatening text messages that Hemphill allegedly sent to victims.",
      "Hemphill met the six women through websites, including some that specialize in \"sugar daddy\" arrangements for women seeking wealthy romantic partners, Curzer said.",
      "He told the women he was into role play and dominance and offered them large sums of money in exchange for sex and companionship, though he ended up not paying some of the women or giving them fake cash instead, Curzer said.",
      "As Hemphill got to know the women, he convinced them to confide their past sexual traumas, which he then deliberately reenacted as he assaulted them, Curzer said. He took advantage of some victims' inexperience, the prosecutor said, or crossed boundaries that victims had clearly articulated.",
      "Hemphill is accused of tricking victims into ingesting substances that rendered them unable to fight back, using handcuffs and other restraints on them, wrapping their heads and faces with duct tape, slapping and punching them, and torturing them with a cattle prod and shock collar.",
      "Hemphill kept one victim shackled to a bed for hours while she begged him to let her go, Curzer said.",
      "Hemphill's alleged conduct is \"truly shocking to the conscience,\" and he \"has made clear that he has no regard for the law or the courts,\" Curzer said.",
      "To keep women quiet, Hemphill boasted about connections to law enforcement and organized crime, prosecutors said, and claimed that because the women had accepted offers of money, it was them who would be arrested.",
      "Hemphill is charged with bribing a witness and, according to prosecutors, drew up a contract in which he agreed to pay a woman $2,000 in exchange for dropping a complaint she filed with police. He is also accused of forcing some victims to record videos in which they stated that they had consented to being abused.",
      "\"The power imbalance in his predatory acts could not be more clear,\" Bragg told reporters. \"He wielded his law degree and money as both sword and shield, coercing and silencing survivors.\"",
      "The arraignment happened down the hall from disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's rape retrial.",
      "Scherzer ordered Hemphill to remain jailed without bail after prosecutors raised concerns that his predicament, combined with his wealth and connections - including a history of philanthropy and family real estate holdings \u2014 could give him the means and incentive to flee the country.",
      "Hemphill's lawyer, a public defender assigned to represent him at least through his arraignment, had urged Scherzer to move him to a rehabilitation facility to deal with substance abuse issues.",
      "Scherzer ruled that, given the fact pattern laid out by prosecutors, \"including efforts to dissuade by force and threats to witnesses from testifying against him,\" jailing him was the only way to ensure Hemphill would return to court.",
      "Hemphill's alleged behavior, the judge said, \"shows his extent to which he's willing to go to protect himself from facing these charges.\"",
      "\"The details in this case are beyond disturbing \u2014 a sustained, calculated campaign of violence and cruelty that targeted vulnerable women,\" NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a\u00a0statement. \"This kind of predatory abuse has no place in our city and will be met with the full force of the law.\"",

      "Francis sharply disagreed with Mr. Trump's approach on issues including immigration, the treatment of migrants and climate change. The Argentine pontiff and the American president sparred early in their relationship over immigration. In 2016, Francis, alluding to then-candidate Trump and his campaign slogan of \"Build the wall,\" called anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants \" not Christian.\" Mr. Trump said the comment was \"disgraceful.\"",
      "But after Francis' death, the Republican president praised him as a \"good man\" who \"worked hard\" and \"loved the world.\" Mr. Trump also directed that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff in Francis' honor.",
      "Mr. Trump had said on a couple of occasions before leaving Washington that he would have \"a lot\" of meetings with counterparts on the sidelines of the funeral. But he seemed to back away from that as he flew to Rome.",
      "\"Frankly, it's a little disrespectful to have meetings when you're at the funeral of a pope,\" the president told reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump said, \"I'll be talking to people. I'll be seeing a lot of people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't elaborate when asked if he'd just be meeting leaders in passing or holding more in-depth talks. He suggested he might have meetings at Villa Taverna, the U.S. ambassador's residence, where he spent the night.",

      "During the conclave, eligible cardinals will isolate themselves and, behind closed doors in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, they will cast ballots for their choice, repeating the process until a candidate receives a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The ballots, which are paper, are burned after each round of voting.",
      "If no choice has been reached, the ballots from that round send up black smoke from the chimney as they burn. When a new pope is finally selected, a cloud of white smoke is sent up to signal the momentous news to the world.",

The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the devastating Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. \u00a0A\u00a0massive explosion\u00a0rocked a port in southern Iran Saturday, injuring at least 400 people, as talks began.",
      "Mr. Trump, traveling to Rome for\u00a0the funeral of Pope Francis, again said he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.",
      "\"The Iran situation is coming out very well,\" Trump said on Air Force One. \"We've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.\"",
      "He added: \"There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal \u2014 a much nastier deal \u2014 and I don't want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.\"",

      "The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America's efforts in the 2015 talks.",
      "Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. The demand that all enrichment stop has also been repeated by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",

      "A procession then carried the pontiff's coffin to his final resting place, a fifth-century church about 3 miles away that held special meaning for him. In his last will and testament, he requested that he be buried not at the Vatican but at the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (St. Mary Major) in Rome, where he went to pray before and after each of his journeys abroad.",

      "Read the full text of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re's homily",
      "This is the translated text of the homily given by Cardinal Re during the funeral of Pope Francis:",
      "In this majestic Saint Peter's Square, where Pope Francis celebrated the Eucharist so many times and presided over great gatherings over the past twelve years, we are gathered with sad hearts in prayer around his mortal remains. Yet, we are sustained by the certainty of faith, which assures us that human existence does not end in the tomb, but in the Father's house, in a life of happiness that will know no end.",
      "On behalf of the College of Cardinals, I cordially thank all of you for your presence. With deep emotion, I extend respectful greetings and heartfelt thanks to the Heads of State, Heads of Government and Official Delegations who have come from many countries to express their affection, veneration and esteem for our late Holy Father.",
      "The outpouring of affection that we have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this earth into eternity tells us how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts.",
      "The final image we have of him, which will remain etched in our memory, is that of last Sunday, Easter Sunday, when Pope Francis, despite his serious health problems, wanted to give us his blessing from the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica. He then came down to this Square to greet the large crowd gathered for the Easter Mass while riding in the open-top Popemobile.",
      "With our prayers, we now entrust the soul of our beloved Pontiff to God, that he may grant him eternal happiness in the bright and glorious gaze of his immense love.",
      "We are enlightened and guided by the passage of the Gospel, in which the very voice of Christ resounded, asking the first of the Apostles: \"Peter, do you love me more than these?\" Peter's answer was prompt and sincere: \"Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you!\" Jesus then entrusted him with the great mission: \"Feed my sheep.\" This will be the constant task of Peter and his successors, a service of love in the footsteps of Christ, our Master and Lord, who \"came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many\" (Mk 10:45).",
      "Despite his frailty and suffering towards the end, Pope Francis chose to follow this path of self-giving until the last day of his earthly life. He followed in the footsteps of his Lord, the Good Shepherd, who loved his sheep to the point of giving his life for them. And he did so with strength and serenity, close to his flock, the Church of God, mindful of the words of Jesus quoted by the Apostle Paul: \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\" (Acts 20:35).",
      "When Cardinal Bergoglio was elected by the Conclave on 13 March 2013 to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, he already had many years of experience in religious life in the Society of Jesus and, above all, was enriched by twenty-one years of pastoral ministry in the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, first as Auxiliary, then as Coadjutor and, above all, as Archbishop.",
      "The decision to take the name Francis immediately appeared to indicate the pastoral plan and style on which he wanted to base his pontificate, seeking inspiration from the spirit of Saint Francis of Assisi.",
      "He maintained his temperament and form of pastoral leadership, and through his resolute personality, immediately made his mark on the governance of the Church. He established direct contact with individuals and peoples, eager to be close to everyone, with a marked attention to those in difficulty, giving himself without measure, especially to the marginalised, the least among us. He was a Pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone. He was also a Pope attentive to the signs of the times and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in the Church.",
      "With his characteristic vocabulary and language, rich in images and metaphors, he always sought to shed light on the problems of our time with the wisdom of the Gospel. He did so by offering a response guided by the light of faith and encouraging us to live as Christians amid the challenges and contradictions in recent years, which he loved to describe as an \"epochal change.\" He had great spontaneity and an informal way of addressing everyone, even those far from the Church.",
      "Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today's challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time of globalization. He gave of himself by comforting and encouraging us with a message capable of reaching people's hearts in a direct and immediate way.",
      "His charisma of welcome and listening, combined with a manner of behavior in keeping with today's sensitivities, touched hearts and sought to reawaken moral and spiritual sensibilities. Evangelization was the guiding principle of his pontificate. With a clear missionary vision, he spread the joy of the Gospel, which was the title of his first Apostolic Exhortation, Evangelii gaudium. It is a joy that fills the hearts of all those who entrust themselves to God with confidence and hope.",
      "The guiding thread of his mission was also the conviction that the Church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open. He often used the image of the Church as a \"field hospital\" after a battle in which many were wounded; a Church determined to take care of the problems of people and the great anxieties that tear the contemporary world apart; a Church capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds.",
      "His gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.",
      "It is significant that Pope Francis' first journey was to Lampedusa, an island that symbolizes the tragedy of emigration, with thousands of people drowning at sea. In the same vein was his trip to Lesbos, together with the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Archbishop of Athens, as well as the celebration of a Mass on the border between Mexico and the United States during his journey to Mexico.",
      "Of his 47 arduous Apostolic Journeys, the one to Iraq in 2021, defying every risk, will remain particularly memorable. That difficult Apostolic Journey was a balm on the open wounds of the Iraqi people, who had suffered so much from the inhuman actions of ISIS. It was also an important trip for interreligious dialogue, another significant dimension of his pastoral work. With his 2024 Apostolic Journey to four countries in Asia-Oceania, the Pope reached \"the most peripheral periphery of the world.\"",
      "Pope Francis always placed the Gospel of mercy at the center, repeatedly emphasizing that God never tires of forgiving us. He always forgives, whatever the situation might be of the person who asks for forgiveness and returns to the right path.",
      "He called for the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy in order to highlight that mercy is \"the heart of the Gospel.\"",
      "Mercy and the joy of the Gospel are two key words for Pope Francis.",
      "In contrast to what he called \"the culture of waste,\" he spoke of the culture of encounter and solidarity. The theme of fraternity ran through his entire pontificate with vibrant tones. In his Encyclical Letter Fratelli tutti, he wanted to revive a worldwide aspiration to fraternity, because we are all children of the same Father who is in heaven. He often forcefully reminded us that we all belong to the same human family.",
      "In 2019, during his trip to the United Arab Emirates, Pope Francis signed A Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together, recalling the common fatherhood of God. Addressing men and women throughout the world, in his Encyclical Letter Laudato si' he drew attention to our duties and shared responsibility for our common home, stating, \"No one is saved alone.\"",
      "Faced with the raging wars of recent years, with their inhuman horrors and countless deaths and destruction, Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice, imploring peace and calling for reason and honest negotiation to find possible solutions. War, he said, results in the death of people and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone.",
      "\"Build bridges, not walls\" was an exhortation he repeated many times, and his service of faith as Successor of the Apostle Peter always was linked to the service of humanity in all its dimensions. Spiritually united with all of Christianity, we are here in large numbers to pray for Pope Francis, that God may welcome him into the immensity of his love.",
      "Pope Francis used to conclude his speeches and meetings by saying, \"Do not forget to pray for me.\"",
      "Dear Pope Francis, we now ask you to pray for us. May you bless the Church, bless Rome, and bless the whole world from heaven as you did last Sunday from the balcony of this Basilica in a final embrace with all the people of God, but also embrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.",

His body\u00a0lay in state for three days in St. Peter's Basilica, where members of the public have been filing past to pay their respects.",
      "Unlike his predecessors, who were buried in three nested coffins \u2014 one made of cypress, one made of lead, and one made of elm \u2014 the famously humble Francis chose to be buried in a simple wooden coffin.",
      "That change came as part of recently updated funeral planning for pontiffs, published late last year and approved by Francis.",
      "The updated Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis, as it's called in Latin, also says that the public should be able to view the pope's body in an open coffin.",
      "Another break from tradition is its direction that the ascertainment of the pope's death should take place in a chapel, not his room.",
      "\"A second edition [of the official funeral rites for pontiffs] became necessary, first of all because Pope Francis has requested it, as he himself has stated on several occasions of the need to simplify and adapt certain rites so that the celebration of the funeral of the Bishop of Rome may better expresses [sic] the faith of the Church in the Risen Christ,\" Archbishop Diego Ravelli, Master of Apostolic Ceremonies, said in a statement released by the Vatican at the time of the update.",
      "Archbishop Ravelli also said, \"The renewed rite also needed to emphasise even more that the funeral of the Roman Pontiff is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful person of this world.\"",
      "The other major break from papal funeral tradition is the place where Francis has chosen to be buried.",
      "In his last will and testament, published shortly after his death, Francis requested that he be laid to rest outside the Vatican, in the Papal Basilica of St. Mary Major (Santa Maria Maggiore, in Italian). He often visited that ancient church in Rome to pray before and after his travels.",
      "Many popes are laid to rest inside the Vatican, in the Vatican grottoes, a system of vaults on the lower level of St. Peter's Basilica. The church said seven popes in history have been buried at St. Mary Major, but Francis will be the first one in centuries.",
      "\"I wish that my last earthly journey conclude precisely in this ancient Marian sanctuary where I went for prayer at the beginning and end of each Apostolic journey to confidently entrust my intentions to the Immaculate Mother and thank Her for her docile and maternal care,\" Francis said in his will.",
      "\"The tomb must be in the earth; simple, without particular decoration and with the only inscription: Franciscus,\" he specified. That is also a departure from other popes whose tombs include an inscription honoring their papacy.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis' death on Monday, April 21, the day after Easter Sunday, started off a series of traditions that in a few weeks will culminate in a vote for the next pope.",
      "After Pope Francis is laid to rest Saturday, his successor will be decided by the Catholic Church's cardinal electors, a group of about 135 cardinals under the age of 80, who are expected to begin their conclave in early to mid-May to hold a secretive election for the next pontiff.",
      "\"Every papal conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended,\" John Allen, a longtime observer of the Vatican and editor of the Catholic news site \"Crux,\" said. Several of the likely frontrunners would represent continuity with the direction set by Pope Francis, he said, while others would signal \"a change in a slightly more traditional, conservative direction.\"",
      "No matter their leanings, Allen said, the cardinal electors will be looking for someone who can equal Pope Francis' stature on the world stage. \"They want, in part, someone who can have the same capacity to make it absolutely impossible for the wider world to ignore what the Catholic Church has to say.\"",
      "Over the last 600 years \u2014 since 1378 \u2014 cardinals have been chosen for the position, although eligibility technically extends to any male Roman Catholic who has been baptized.",
      "Here is look at some of the cardinals considered possible contenders to become pope:",
      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, archbishop of Budapest, Hungary",
      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, a 72-year-old canon lawyer, is the highest ranking Catholic leader in a country that is 80% Christian. He is known for his support of the pope's outreach to Orthodox Christians.",
      "Erdo is also on the conservative side of the European cultural divide. On migration, a key issue for Hungary, he has conveyed a balanced approach, recognizing the right to migrate but also the importance of ensuring political stability.",
      "Erdo is considered a traditionalist but is also respected by liberals, which could make him a unifying force within the church.",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, archbishop of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, grew global attention for leading African bishops in unanimous rejection of \"Fiducia Supplicans,\" a declaration the Vatican issued in 2023 that included guidelines on the blessings of people in same-sex relationships.",
      "At 65 years old, he is known as a supporter of orthodoxy and defends priestly celibacy and the Church's moral teachings. He is also known as a promoter of social justice and a champion of the poor and voiceless, and is outspoken in his criticism of the Congolese government.",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary general for the Synod of Bishops",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, 68, is a canon lawyer who has major influence on how synods in the church are run. Supporters have praised him for leading the charge in implementing a more consultative and inclusive approach to church governance.",
      "Grech comes from Malta, which is one of the smallest countries in the world.",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, 70, is second-in-command at the Vatican and a career diplomat who has consistently risen above any turbulence marking the pontificate.",
      "He is regarded as a moderate who, if elected, could repair rifts inside the church. He is also considered a progressive with a global vision.",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, is a pastoral candidate who has spoken out amid the Israel-Hamas war and visited Gaza during the conflict.",
      "He is a proponent of social justice and sees himself as a servant of the people. He is similar to Francis in his concern for migrants, interfaith dialogue and his disdain for clericalism.",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, and pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics.",
      "He is the former archbishop of Manila, in the Philippines, which is one of the most Catholic countries on the continent of Asia, and studied in the U.S. for seven years. His election would signal a continuation of Francis' pontificate.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, archbishop of Bologna, Italy",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, 69, is the president of the Italian bishops conference. He is known as a \"street priest\" and missionary and wants a church that listens to the faithful and is willing to modernize. Zuppi is inclusive of same-sex couples, as well as people of different religions.",
      "Francis chose Zuppi as his envoy to Russia and Ukraine, as well as to the West Bank and Beijing, to promote peace.",
      "Cardinal Anders Arborelius, archbishop of Stockholm",
      "Cardinal Anders Arborelius, 75, was raised Lutheran and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. He is the first ever cardinal from Scandinavia.",
      "He is also a traditionalist on the church's teaching on sexual ethics and gender, and has a strong concern for the environment.",
      "Arborelius has been a proponent of immigration into Sweden, calling for dialogue and integration instead of restrictions.",
      "Cardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix of Quebec",
      "Cardinal G\u00e9rald Cyprien Lacroix, Metropolitan Archbishop of Quebec, Canada, is 67 years old. Earlier in his career he spent years as a missionary and seminary professor in Colombia.",
      "He temporarily stepped back from his duties amid sexual abuse allegations, which he denied, and returned to his duties last year after a church-led investigation found no evidence of misconduct.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis's death at the age of 88 means the Catholic Church must choose a new leader. Here's how cardinals elect the next pontiff at the conclave.",
    "story": [
      "The reign of Pope Francis is over, and as the Catholic Church mourns his death, it is also looking to the future. Soon after Saturday's funeral, a papal conclave must be held to choose his successor, and the question now turns to which man \u2014 and it will be a man, as women cannot be ordained priests in the Catholic Church \u2014 will emerge and step onto the balcony in papal regalia to greet the crowds massed in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.",
      "What is the papal conclave, exactly?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely-guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 all serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but there are currently about 135 cardinal electors who will convene at the Vatican from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis.",
      "Of those eligible this time around, a large majority \u2014 108 of them \u2014 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries; 10 are from the United States.",
      "When will the papal conclave begin?",
      "The Vatican has not yet announced the date when the conclave will begin, but under church rules, it must be within 15 to 20 days after the pope's death, which in this case would fall in the first or second week of May.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" \u2014 We have a pope.",
      "Finally, the new leader of the Catholic Church emerges into the spotlight to deliver his first blessing.",

    "story": [
      "Theologian and Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss what's to come in the wake of Pope Francis' death.",
      "Viewership of the movie \"Conclave,\" which depicts the choosing of a new pope, has spiked in the days since Pope Francis died. But how much of the Academy Award winner is accurate to the real event about to take place?",
      "The Rev. Bryan Pham, a Jesuit priest and associate director for Catholic Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, told Fox News Digital he believes the movie was accurate according to the \"timeline and sequence of events of how to handle the death of a pope, the relaying of information, the gathering of the cardinals, and general procedures of getting the new pope elected.\"",
      "Pham, who was a graduate student in Rome during the last conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013, also said the \"side conversations among the cardinals as they try to identify the challenges and the needs of the church when considering the qualities of the next pope\" rang true.",
      "HOW POPE FRANCIS' EXAMPLE 'SOUNDS A LOT LIKE JESUS'",
      "Ralph Fiennes in \"Conclave\" (Alamy)",
      "\"Although, in real-life, these conversations happen in what is called \u2018general congregation\u2019 and is much more formal,\" he said. \"But of course, cardinals are also mere mortals, so gossips and side-conversations do happen.\"",
      "\"Conclave,\" which came out last year and won the Oscar in March for best adapted screenplay, stars Ralph Fiennes as the cardinal in charge of the conclave after a fictional pope dies. It also stars Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow.",
      "Pham said the real conclave was an \"extraordinary experience,\" adding that some parts of the movie sensationalized the centuries-old ritual.",
      "\"Where \u2018Conclave\u2019 was clearly a Hollywood movie that wants to be sensational, create potential scandals for shock value in order to make money and perhaps perpetuate the anti-Catholic sentiment (especially in the United States)\" was \"everything else that played into the negative aspect of the Catholic mystique that perpetuate the Catholic Church as primitive and byzantine,\" he said.",

      "\"That said, I thought the movie was done well,\" Pham said. \"There were beautiful imageries, and the cinematography was excellent. The actors were also top-notch. I only wish Isabella Rossellini had a more prominent role (or lines); she is such an accomplished actor to be cast in such a relatively minor role.\"",
      "Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo, who has personally witnessed three conclaves and is heading back to Rome for this one, said viewership of the movie spiked because it\u2019s \"in the zeitgeist. Anytime you have a pope die, you know, the visuals, the rituals of the church and the ceremony that accompanies the election of a pope is fascinating.\"",
      "Pope Francis died on Monday. (Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)",
      "Amazon Prime made \"Conclave\" available for free on its streaming service on Monday after the pope died.",

      "Arroyo agreed with Pham that the movie gets \"some of the details of the ritual, which is evocative and beautiful and fascinating\" right.",
      "\"And frankly, that's the best part of \u2018Conclave,' which is otherwise a very boring, draggy movie,\" Arroyo said.",
      "He noted that \"the writing of the ballot, the going up and swearing before Michelangelo's last judgment,\" raising their ballots and making an oath to the last judgment, placing the ballots in a vessel and having them counted by counters was all accurate.",
      "\"Conclave\" won the Oscar this year for best adapted screenplay. (Alamy)",
      "\"They count votes, and then they run a needle and string through them,\" he continued. \"So, all of that is correct. What's wrong is kind of the surrounds of the thing. The politics, the conversations playing out. It was very cartoonish, melodramatic dialogue.\"",
      "\"None of that happens in that way,\" he said, \"and the intrigue, I wish it were that interesting and fascinating, all the intrigues and people dying, having kids out of wedlock and all that, that's not happening.",

      "He said that during the conclave, the cardinals are all housed in a hotel across the street from St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.",
      "\"And they would, as depicted in the movie, if memory serves, they get on a bus, and they take them over to the Sistine Chapel, and they go in, and they're locked in for the day. You know they're basically locked in.\"",
      "Arroyo said that tradition goes back to one conclave when the cardinals weren\u2019t able to elect a pope for a year, \"and the conclave kept dragging on, and they hadn't elected a pope, so they decided to lock them in the place and not give them food or water, pressure them to make a decision.\"",

      "\"I thought the movie \u2018Conclave\u2019 exploited the church's visuals to drive home a message and a version of the church that just isn't on point,\" he said. \"I mean, when the nuns [were] lecturing all the cardinals while they're eating, that would never happen.

      "But he said they missed \"the heart of\" what it\u2019s all about.",

      "Arroyo said the concept \"runs counter to everything the church has ever taught. You know, Jesus didn't say follow me in doubt. He said follow me and believe. So that's what you're called to do. And no, doubt is not part of that.\"",
      "He continued, \"The wonder of miracles is that, you know, they defy reality, they defy natural law. That's the wonder of it: it shatters reality in some ways. But there's no doubt involved in that. It either happened or didn't happen. But if it happens, it wakes a lot of people up, and that's what happened initially. And that's why these people gave their lives for what Jesus said and for Christ himself. They gave their life because he rose again.\"",
      "\"That idea of doubt being at the heart of faith and at the heart of the church is a stupid one,\" he said, \"and one that people, I think a certain cast of mind, would like the church to pursue that path.\"",
      "The movie, he said, \"cast a certain ideological vision that they imagined the church should be, and it was an open, it's basically an open church, cut off from the very traditions that they celebrated and that the movie profits off of.\"",

The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, between October and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",

However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",

      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",

Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches.

Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

While many are helpful for blocking ads, finding the best deals or checking grammar errors, some can end up doing more harm than good.",

      "A recent\u00a0investigation by John Tuckner, founder of Secure Annex, revealed concerns about 35 Chrome extensions, posing potential privacy and security risks. These extensions, many unlisted on the Chrome Web Store, were collectively installed over 4 million times.",
      "Many of these sketchy extensions presented themselves as tools for search assistance, ad-blocking, security monitoring or extension scanning but shared a connection to a single, unused domain, suggesting coordinated behavior. They all use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs and execute scripts.",
      "What\u2019s more concerning is that at least 10 of these extensions carried Google\u2019s \"Featured\" badge, implying vetting for trustworthiness. This raises questions about Google\u2019s review process, as the badge suggests compliance with high standards for user experience, privacy and security.",

With permissions to read tabs, access cookies, intercept web requests and inject scripts into pages, they can monitor nearly everything you do in your browser. This includes tracking your browsing activity, observing login sessions and altering the content of websites you visit, all without your knowledge.",
      "These extensions are not simply misconfigured tools. They appear to be intentionally designed with surveillance in mind. Many store their configuration data locally, which allows remote servers to update their behavior at any time. This setup is commonly seen in spyware, where changes can be made after installation without alerting the user. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for researchers to understand what the extensions are actually doing.",
      "In some cases, the extensions appear to do nothing at all when clicked. However, they continue to send data in the background. For instance, the Fire Shield Extension Protection remained inactive until the researcher manually triggered it with a specific extension ID. Only then did it begin to transmit browsing activity and other data, revealing behavior that would be hard for an average user to detect.",

      "2) Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "3) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0A good antivirus can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5) Change your passwords and do it safely: If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via Chrome\u2019s built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer, where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then consider switching to a\u00a0password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward. I\u2019ve reviewed the top options in my\u00a0best password managers of 2025 guide. See which one fits your needs best.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The fact that several of these extensions carried Google\u2019s own \"Featured\" badge should serve as a wake-up call. It points to a serious lapse in oversight and raises concerns about how thorough Chrome\u2019s extension review process actually is. When millions of users unknowingly install spyware under the impression that it has been vetted and approved, the issue is no longer just about bad actors. It reflects a deeper failure within the platform itself. Google needs to take stronger responsibility by improving transparency and tightening its review standards.",

    "story": [
      "\"The Big Weekend Show\" analyzes the possibilities of artificial intelligence when it comes to influencing voters.",
      "If you haven\u2019t heard the buzz about Manus yet, it's the new AI model unveiled by a Singapore-based company called Butterfly Effect. This isn\u2019t just another chatbot. It\u2019s one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight.",
      "Sounds impressive, right? But here\u2019s the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions. Whether you\u2019re eager to try out the latest AI or you\u2019d rather steer clear, it\u2019s worth understanding what Manus could mean for your personal data and digital safety.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Your data could be used to train AI, even if you go nowhere near it",
      "This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have been\u00a0several class-action lawsuits against tech companies for scraping personal data for\u00a0use in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses \"stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.\"",
      "Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including\u00a0Manus AI when it\u2019s released to the public) or not, there\u2019s still a good chance that they have your personal information.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "Why should you care if AI has your data?",
      "It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information \u2013 things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos \u2013 they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren\u2019t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,\u00a0DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That\u2019s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.",
      "But data leaks aren\u2019t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.",
      "In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS",
      "Manus AI poses even bigger risks",
      "Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it\u2019s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.",
      "If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it\u2019s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.",
      "So even if Manus isn\u2019t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.",

      "GENAI, THE FUTURE OF FRAUD AND WHY YOU MAY BE AN EASY TARGET",
      "So, how can you protect yourself?",
      "As I\u2019ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.",
      "1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it\u2019s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it quite yet. There\u2019s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.",
      "2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it\u2019s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can\u2019t avoid sharing it.",
      "3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can\u2019t be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus\u2019 ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.\u00a0Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.",
      "6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools\u00a0updated at all times.",
      "7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,\u00a0MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.",
      "8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "As we move forward with AI like Manus, it\u2019s exciting to think about the possibilities, but it's also important to keep our eyes open about what it means for our personal data. Even if you never use Manus yourself, your info could still end up in its training data.",
      "So what can you do? Stay informed, take charge of your digital footprint and choose tools that prioritize your privacy. As AI keeps evolving, being proactive about your data is the best way to enjoy the benefits of innovation while keeping your personal info safe.",

Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently.",
      "Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently.",

Inspired by steel measuring tapes, this prototype uses layered \"fingers\" to grasp delicate fruits gently. Early tests show promise in handling objects like lemons and tomatoes without damage, but it has yet to be widely adopted in farming.",

      "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from covering data breaches over the years, it\u2019s that you should never take a company\u2019s initial numbers at face value. When a breach becomes public, most companies try to minimize the damage by reporting fewer victims or staying vague about what kind of data was exposed.",
      "Sometimes, to be fair, they genuinely don\u2019t have the full picture yet. But that rarely gets communicated clearly. The same thing just happened again with an insurtech company that has now doubled the number of people affected by a breach it disclosed last year.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Texas-based insurance administrative services provider Landmark Admin has revised the scope of its May 2024 cyberattack, revealing that nearly twice as many people were impacted as initially reported. Back in October 2024, Landmark disclosed that suspicious activity was detected in its network on May 13, prompting an investigation. At the time,\u00a0it was estimated that the breach affected 806,519 individuals. But in a recent update filed with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s office, that number has now jumped to 1,613,773.",
      "Landmark serves as a third-party administrator offering backend support to major insurers like Liberty Bankers Life and American Benefit Life. This means millions of sensitive insurance policy records flow through its systems, making it a tempting target for cybercriminals.",
      "The compromised information varies for each individual but may include a wide range of sensitive personal data. This includes full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver's license or state-issued identification numbers, passport numbers and bank account details. In some cases, medical information, dates of birth, health insurance policy numbers and details related to life and annuity policies may also have been exposed.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from insurance data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Landmark breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Landmark data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised. They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "4) Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.\u00a0One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark\u2019s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public\u2019s favor. By the time the full picture emerges, the damage may already be done.",

      "\u200b\u200bImagine powering your boat not with gasoline but with clean hydrogen fuel. That\u2019s exactly what Yamaha, together with Roush Industries and Regulator Marine, is working on right now. They\u2019re developing the world\u2019s first hydrogen-combustion outboard engine, aiming to make boating greener and more sustainable.",

      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The big, big moment: First hydrogen fill-up",
      "To reach their goal, a specially modified Regulator Marine 26XO boat was taken to a hydrogen fueling station. The team filled its tanks with hydrogen for the very first time, which was a huge milestone. This 26-foot boat runs on a tweaked version of Yamaha\u2019s powerful 450hp XTO outboard engine, but instead of gasoline, it\u2019s fueled by gaseous hydrogen.",
      "Matt Van Benschoten from Roush, who\u2019s been deeply involved in the project, called it\u00a0\"a big moment.\" He handled the tricky job of designing and integrating the hydrogen fuel system, making sure everything was safe and worked smoothly.",

      "What\u2019s different about this hydrogen outboard?",
      "Yamaha started with their largest offshore outboard, the XTO 450, and made some smart changes to handle hydrogen. They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen\u2019s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version.",
      "The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that\u2019s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha\u2019s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications.",

      "Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There\u2019s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot.",
      "Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises.",

They\u2019ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They\u2019re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient.",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and possibilities of hydrogen technology",
      "Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn\u2019t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges.",
      "And it\u2019s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they\u2019re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies.",
      "Ben Speciale, president of Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit, tells Cyberguy, \"Our hydrogen outboard concept is on the water now, and we\u2019re learning more about how to optimize its performance every day. We believe a multiple-technology solution is the best way to achieve cleaner products on the water, and hydrogen represents one of those pathways within our product line. We\u2019re optimistic about the future of hydrogen in the marine industry, and we look forward to sharing specific performance data as it becomes available.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says an Apple Watch saved psychiatrist Amanda Faulkner by detecting deadly leukemia early.",
      "In recent years, smartwatches have gone far beyond just telling the time or tracking steps. These little gadgets on our wrists are becoming powerful health tools, quietly monitoring our bodies and sometimes even alerting us to serious medical issues before we realize something\u2019s wrong. From tracking heart rate and sleep patterns to measuring blood oxygen levels, smartwatches are helping people stay more in tune with their health than ever before.",

      "Apple Watch saves woman\u2019s life (Amanda Faulkner) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The life-saving power of wearable technology",
      "Take Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story, for example. Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn\u2019t think much of it. But her new\u00a0Apple Watch kept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s.",
      "At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life.",
      "Within hours of tests, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer. Doctors told her that if she had waited another 48 hours, she might not have survived.",

      "HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "The wider impact of Amanda\u2019s story",
      "Amanda\u2019s experience shows just how powerful these wearable devices can be, not as medical diagnosis tools but as early warning systems that encourage people to seek help sooner. Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren\u2019t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference.",
      "Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy an\u00a0Apple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated. She has also had complete strangers come to see her in the hospital to discuss their own cancer journeys, and as Amanda cannot work in her role as a psychiatrist, these interactions have been great, allowing Amanda to \u2018help\u2019 people again, which, after all, is her vocation in life.\"",
      "Amanda remains in treatment, including chemotherapy and an upcoming stem cell transplant, but she remains optimistic and grateful for the smartwatch that gave her a fighting chance. She urges others, especially women who often have their symptoms dismissed, to trust their instincts and advocate for their health.",
      "Apple Watch saves woman\u2019s life (Amanda Faulkner) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "Limitations and risks of smartwatch health monitoring",
      "While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it\u2019s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone\u2019s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It\u2019s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smartwatches are more than just tech accessories; they\u2019re becoming essential health companions. While they don\u2019t replace professional medical advice, their ability to monitor vital signs continuously and alert users to potential problems is transforming how we approach health. Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story is a powerful reminder that sometimes the smallest devices can make the biggest difference, literally saving lives by catching warning signs early. So, if your smartwatch starts \"nagging\" you about your health, it might just be worth paying attention to it.",

This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",
      "One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place.",
      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus.",

      "FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there\u2019s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.",
      "What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.",

      "4 practical ways to stay safe from USB-targeted attacks",
      "1. Don\u2019t plug in unknown USB drives:\u00a0It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren\u2019t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.",
      "2.\u00a0Be extra cautious with email attachments:\u00a0GOFFEE\u2019s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender\u2019s address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to \"enable macros\" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.",
      "3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many attacks like GOFFEE\u2019s start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Scan USB drives before use:\u00a0The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don\u2019t click them until verified safe.",
      "How to scan a USB flash drive for malware (PC & Mac)",
      "No matter which antivirus tool you use, it\u2019s essential to scan USB flash drives as soon as you plug them in. Here\u2019s how to do it on both platforms:",

They\u2019re not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud.

      "How does it all come together?",
      "The magic behind the Hive is Ocado\u2019s smart platform, which combines artificial intelligence, robotics and automation to tackle the unique challenges of online grocery shopping. Factors like tight profit margins, the wide variety of items customers order and the need to handle products at different temperatures all make online groceries a tough nut to crack. But Ocado has been developing this technology for over 20 years, and it shows.",
      "Thanks to this platform, a 50-item grocery order can be picked and packed in just five minutes, six times faster than traditional methods. The robotic arms don\u2019t just blindly pack items. They use advanced computer vision and deep learning to make smart decisions on the fly, packing groceries densely and safely even without knowing what\u2019s coming next.",
      "And behind the scenes, Ocado uses digital twin technology, essentially a virtual replica of the warehouse, to simulate and optimize everything from customer demand to delivery routes. This means it can innovate quickly and reduce risks before making changes in the real world.",

Plus, Ocado\u2019s warehouses can offer up to 78% more products than a typical supermarket, giving customers a much wider selection tailored to their preferences.",
      "The system also helps reduce food waste dramatically. Ocado\u2019s waste rate is just a tiny fraction of the industry average, thanks to smart forecasting and precise inventory management.",
      "Another big advantage is flexibility. The Hive\u2019s modular design means retailers can scale their operations up or down depending on their needs.

      "Over $1 billion from UNRWA\u2019s New York bank account in Manhattan was involved in allegedly benefiting the U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hamas, the lawsuit noted. The lawsuit also accuses the agency of allowing tunnels and command centers to be built under its sites.",

      "Indian and Pakistani soldiers briefly exchanged fire along their highly militarized frontier in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, Indian officials said Friday, as tensions soared between the nuclear-armed rivals following a deadly attack on tourists.",
      "India has described the massacre in which gunmen killed 26 people, most of them Indian, as a \"terror attack\" and accused Pakistan of backing it. Pakistan denied any connection to the attack near the resort town of Pahalgam in India-controlled Kashmir. It was claimed by a previously unknown militant group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance.",
      "INDIA VOWS TO HUNT TERRORISTS \u2018TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH\u2019 AS TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN RISE AFTER KASHMIR ATTACK",
      "With the region on edge, three Indian army officials said that Pakistani soldiers fired at an Indian position in Kashmir late Thursday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy, said Indian soldiers retaliated and no casualties were reported.",
      "Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the report.",
      "Tensions rise",
      "Tuesday\u2019s attack in Kashmir was the worst assault in years targeting civilians in the restive region. Since then, tensions have risen dangerously between India and Pakistan, which have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, which is split between them and claimed by both in its entirety.",
      "On Wednesday, India suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty that has withstood two wars between the countries and closed their only functional land border crossing. A day later, India revoked all visas issued to Pakistani nationals with effect from Sunday.",
      "Pakistan responded angrily that it has nothing to do with the attack, and canceled visas issued to Indian nationals, closed its airspace for all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines and suspended all trade with India. Nationals from both sides began heading back to their home countries through the Wagah border near Pakistan\u2019s eastern city of Lahore on Friday.",
      "Islamabad also warned that any Indian attempt to stop or divert the flow of water would be considered an \"act of war.\" The suspension of the water treaty could lead to water shortages at a time when parts of Pakistan are already struggling with drought and declining rainfall.",
      "Pakistan has also warned it could suspend the Simla Agreement \u2014 in what would be a major and worrying step. The peace treaty signed after the 1971 India-Pakistan war established the Line of Control, a highly militarized de facto border that divides Kashmir between the countries.",

      "Residents and police in southern Kashmir said Indian soldiers detonated explosives in the family homes of two suspected militants they accused of being involved in Tuesday\u2019s attack. In the past, Indian troops have demolished homes as a way to punish militancy in Kashmir.",
      "Authorities say they are investigating two local men and two Pakistani nationals for their alleged involvement in the attack. Officials have not elaborated or shared any evidence.",
      "\"He left home three years ago. We haven\u2019t seen him since and nothing was ever recovered from this house despite multiple raids,\" said Afroza, the aunt of one of the local men accused, Asif Sheikh. The blast partially damaged the house in Monghama village that she shares with Sheikh's parents and two sisters, including blowing out its windows. It also shattered windowpanes of several other homes.",
      "\"Even if he had done the attack, why blow up the house of a poor family,\" Afroza, who like many women in Kashmir uses only one name, said as she wailed.",
      "A police official and two residents in Guree village said a house there was also targeted by soldiers. The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with media while the two villagers feared reprisals from authorities.",
      "Protesters take to the streets",
      "Also Friday, hundreds of people rallied in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, to denounce the suspension of the water-sharing treaty.",

This is not far down the Indian Ocean coast from Djibouti, where there are U.S. and Chinese bases. With the new Syrian government likely to kick the Russians out of their base in Tartus, Port Sudan would be Russia\u2019s only foreign naval base.",

    "story": [
      "Catholic Connection radio show host Teresa Tomeo describes the emotional reaction to Pope Francis' procession moving his casket to St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "Cardinal Robert Sarah \u2013 championed by conservatives as reflecting the doctrinaire and liturgically minded papacies of Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI \u2013 is among those being considered to replace Pope Francis.",
      "An African cardinal from Guinea, Sarah, 79, is viewed as a spiritual and theological standard-bearer for conservative Catholics, as critics of Francis have argued the late pope was too heavily influenced by modern secularism.",
      "Sarah previously headed the Vatican\u2019s charity office Cor Unum and clashed with Francis on many occasions.",
      "Their ideological divide most seriously came to a head when Sarah and Benedict \u2013 who retired as acting pope in 2013 \u2013 co-authored a book titled \"From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church.\" The 2020 book advocated the \"necessity\" of continued celibacy for Latin Rite priests and came out as Francis was weighing whether to allow married priests in the Amazon to address a priest shortage there.",

      "As a result, Francis dismissed Benedict\u2019s secretary, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, from his papal household job, and several months later retired Sarah after he turned 75. The prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one created the scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of when Benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement as \"pope emeritus.\" The scandal died down after Benedict removed himself as a co-author.",
      "It's actually Sarah's 2019 book that's causing more of a stir with conservative Christians in the wake of Francis' passing.",
      "Sarah has described \"The Day Is Now Far Spent\" as his most significant book. In it, the cardinal decries how Europe and Western civilization have turned away from Christianity and suffer from ideological challenges brought by mass migration.",
      "By contrast, Francis had openly contradicted the Trump administration and Vice President JD Vance \u2013 a Catholic convert \u2013 over their crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Vance, one of the last dignitaries to meet with Francis on Easter Sunday before his passing, has referenced Pope John Paul II \u2013 ideologically more similar to Sarah \u2013 in recent public addresses. At the Munich Security Conference, Vance praised John Paul II as \"one of the most extraordinary champions of democracy\" when emphasizing the importance of Western values. The vice president also celebrated John Paul II's call for new evangelization at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C.",
      "Sarah co-authored two other books \u2013 \"God or Nothing: A Conversation on Faith\" in 2015 and The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise in 2017 \u2013 both with French journalist Nicolas Diat.",
      "Here are some key quotes by Sarah being highlighted ahead of Francis' funeral later this week. The papal conclave will convene in the coming weeks to choose a new leader of the Catholic Church.",
      "1. The West cut itself off from its 'Christian roots\u2019",
      "Sarah argued that the West has cut itself off from its Christian heritage in \"The Day is Now Far Spent.\"",

      "\"The West no longer knows who it is, because it no longer knows and does not want to know who made it, who established it, as it was and as it is. The West refuses to acknowledge its Christian roots.\"",
      "\"By losing its faith, Europe has also lost its reason to be. It is experiencing a lethal decline and is becoming a new civilization, one that is cut off from its Christian roots.\"\u200b",
      "VANCE WAS ONE OF POPE FRANCIS' LAST VISITORS",
      "2. Gender ideology is \u2018Luciferian\u2019",
      "Sarah argued that gender ideology is an affront to God's creation and cannot fundamentally change whether a person is male or female in \"The Day is Now Far Spent.\"",
      "\"Gender ideology is a Luciferian refusal to receive a sexual nature from God.\"",
      "3. Called mass migration a \u2018new form of slavery\u2019",
      "In a March 2019 interview with the French publication \"Valeurs Actuelles,\" Sarah reportedly criticized the role of the Catholic Church in supporting mass migration policies in Europe, noting the harm caused to the migrants themselves.",
      "\"All migrants who arrive in Europe are penniless, without work, without dignity,\" Sarah reportedly said. \"This is what the Church wants? The Church cannot cooperate with this new form of slavery that has become mass migration.\"\u200b",

      "5. Calls Christians to refuse loyalty to popularity or politics",
      "In \"God or Nothing: A Conversation on Faith,\" Sarah asserts that one's loyalty must be to Christ \u2013 rather than to popularity or politics \u2013 and repeatedly argues against moral relativism in family and societal norms.",

      "\"Simply because Trump hasn\u2019t announced any consequences yet does not mean that he doesn\u2019t plan on taking some anti-Russia measures,\" former DIA intelligence officer and Russia expert Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"Trump almost certainly intends for his economic warfare against China to serve as an example to Putin how far Trump is willing to go to compel his adversaries to his will.\"",
      "\"But unlike the China case, there\u2019s no similar dependence between the U.S. and Russia. Trump\u2019s decision on Russia is much more complicated, more risky and requires more thought,\" she added. \"He may or may not take draconian economic steps against Russia, as Putin may take devastating, non-kinetic actions against the U.S.",
      "\"It\u2019s Trump\u2019s risk tolerance vs. Putin\u2019s now,\" Koffler said. \"And both like to win and both have risk tolerance way above average.\"",

      "\"If we want to be a global superpower, and we want to deter aggression, not with U.S. troops on the ground, but in general, to deter aggression \u2013 including potentially with China against Taiwan \u2013 because it is good for our national security, then we should think about good options to continue to support Ukraine,\" former CIA Moscow Station Chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital. \"It's a tiny percentage of the Department of Defense budget.\"",

      "\"Its Ukraine's war of self-defense but its in our interest to deter Putin just as we did with his Soviet predecessors,\" Hoffman said. \"If our goal is to break Putin's alliance with Iran, North Korea and China, then the best way to do it is to prove that Putin's war on Ukraine is a loser for him.\"",

      "The Kremlin\u2019s position has given credence to repeated warnings from security experts that Putin is not interested in securing a peace deal with Ukraine.",
      "\"There's no indication that Putin wants to stop the war,\" Hoffman said. \"That isn't surprising. Because for a war to end, somebody has to win or both sides have to be so tired they can't continue to fight.",
      "\"Russia is the invader, so you have to stop them in order to have an end of the war,\" he added. \"The one consistent thing here is Putin is continuing to fight. His objective is to overthrow the government in Ukraine. He\u2019s going to keep fighting until he feels like he has accomplished that goal or he can't fight anymore.\"",

      "\"He could promise Trump not to share certain sensitive technologies to these two [nations],\" Koffler said. \"And he could convince Iran not to operationalize and weaponize its nuclear program in exchange for Trump\u2019s promise not to target Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in a kinetic strike and to lift sanctions from Russia.",
      "\"The important aspect of all of this is to give these adversaries face-saving opportunities, which is not a strong point for the U.S. style of diplomacy,\" Koffler said. \"But Putin\u2019s ability to convince Trump and Trump\u2019s decision calculus are two different things.\"",

      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 One of\u00a0Pope Francis\u2019\u00a0most\u00a0significant legacies\u00a0is his elevation of women\u00a0to high-level positions\u00a0at the Vatican, in roles historically held only by men.",
      "The appointments were heralded by some as monumental steps forward in an ancient institution defined by patriarchal power, while others criticized them as falling short of systemic change.",
      "In February, Francis made the highest-ranking appointment of his papacy from his hospital bed, naming Sister Raffaella Petrini to a role akin to the governor of Vatican City.",
      "Other notable appointments include Sister Alessandra Smerilli, an economist, to a senior position in a department of the Roman Curia, the Vatican\u2019s governing body, that deals with development issues, and Sister Simona Brambilla became the first woman to lead a major Vatican department, overseeing the world\u2019s Catholic religious orders.",
      "He appointed Sister Nathalie Becquart as co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops, preparing summits for the pope\u2019s advisory body, and gave women the vote for the first time at synod summit meetings, expanding the body to include women as full members. By October 2024, there were nearly 60 women joining around 300 cardinals, bishops and priests in the synod.",
      "Paloma Garcia Ovejero, who was the first woman to serve as the deputy head of the Holy See\u2019s press office, said Francis\u2019 move to assign more of the Vatican governing power to women was just the beginning.",
      "\u201cOf course, having a woman in charge of the town hall should be normal, but it isn\u2019t. Of course, having women in top-level positions should be normal, but it isn\u2019t. So elevating women in the church is only just starting, but there\u2019s no turning back,\u201d Garcia Ovejero said.",
      "\u201cWe saw these amazing appointments,\u201d Elizabeth Lev, a Rome-based art historian, said. \u201cReally startling appointments.\u201d",
      "Lev said Francis\u2019 moves reflect shifts in the wider society. \u201cIn many ways, what Pope Francis has done is simply taken these women \u2014 these religious sisters or lay women who have worked behind the scenes carrying an incredible burden on their shoulders \u2014 and given them the title,\u201d Lev said.",
      "\u201cFinally gave them the spotlight they deserve,\u201d Lev said. \u201cAnd that is wonderful. And he chose women who are competent, women who are joyous.\u201d",
      "\u201cPope Francis\u2019 legacy on the place of women in the church ... is complex,\u201d Anna Rowlands, a professor at Durham University in the U.K. and occasional Vatican adviser, told Reuters.",
      "\u201cHe did more than any other pontiff to ensure that women are included in greater numbers and higher positions of authority,\u201d Rowlands said. \u201cYet, most of that change was precisely within existing parameters, flexing the system (only) a little.\u201d",
      "Still, there are many limits to women\u2019s role in the Catholic Church. Francis repeatedly reaffirmed that priestly ordination is \u201creserved for men\u201d \u2014 and when the 135 male cardinals gather to elect the next pope during next month\u2019s conclave, it will remain clear where the church\u2019s powers lie."

      "Dust off the history books and there are papal conclaves with international intrigue, royal rigging and even riots, a checkered past that belies the air of sanctity and solemnity surrounding modern papal elections.",
      "The word \u201cconclave\u201d comes from the Latin for \u201cwith key.\u201d It is a church tradition that began in 1268 with a papal election that lasted almost three years, ending only when the townspeople of Viterbo locked up the cardinals, tore the roof off their palace, fed them nothing but bread and water and threatened them until a new pope was chosen.",
      "While it is very unlikely the decision on Pope Francis\u2019 successor will take quite as long or be quite as contentious, Vatican watchers agree that the winner is not a foregone conclusion.",
      "\u201cThe great joy of the conclave is that nobody really knows and it\u2019s such a unique electorate,\u201d James Somerville-Meikle, the former deputy director of the Catholic Union of Great Britain, told NBC News before Francis\u2019 death. \u201cSo many conclaves in the past have thrown up surprises.\u201d",
      "The College of Cardinals, he said, has always been faced with two questions: \u201cDo we try something new? Do we go for continuity?\u201d",
      "NBC News takes a look at the figures believed to be the top contenders.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi",
      "The fifth of six siblings, the Rome-born Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, 69, has built a reputation as a peacemaker and has worked with the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic lay association devoted to ecumenism and conflict resolution.",
      "\u201cThat community had a very active role in peace-building activities and finding agreements in Africa, where they have been involved in South Sudan,\u201d said NBC Vatican analyst Deborah Lubov. The east African nation has been ravaged by civil war, violence and famine since it gained independence from neighboring Sudan in March 2011.",
      "Lubov added that Zuppi, the archbishop of Bologna, was one of four mediators who helped bring an end to the civil war in the east African country of Mozambique in 1982 and more recently had been Francis\u2019 envoy for peace in Ukraine and Russia.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very smart man, left of center, although ideologically speaking he is very close to the center of the church,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University.\u00a0\u201cHe would be a mix between John Paul II and Pope Francis on social issues and moral issues.\u201d",
      "Tim Gabrielli, the Gudorf chair in Catholic intellectual traditions at the University of Dayton in Ohio, agreed that Zuppi was \u201cvery close to Francis,\u201d and that he is \u201cvery much a pastor figure, close to the people.\u201d",
      "But Gabrielli said Zuppi was \u201crelative newcomer\u201d when it comes to Italian episcopal politics and didn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily have the breadth of Vatican experience that is often looked at.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin",
      "The second Italian on the list, Parolin, 70, has been Francis' secretary of state since the pope chose him in 2013.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a diplomat, and this is something that the cardinals might like,\u201d said Faggioli, although he added that as secretary of state \u201cyou have to make many decisions on behalf of the pope, and you have to make a number of enemies among other cardinals.\u201d",
      "Parolin, Faggioli said, is \u201ca centrist, and he\u2019s a man of the institution, a stabilizer.\u201d",
      "However, Faggioli and other Vatican insiders agreed that Parolin\u2019s chances could take a hit because he was the chief architect of an agreement with China on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops in the communist country that gave the pope the final say.",
      "Critics complained that it betrayed Catholics who remained loyal to the pope despite persecution, and some have said it prevented the Vatican from denouncing rights abuses in China. They also point to increasing restrictions on religious freedoms in China for Christians and other minorities.",
      "Parolin would have a lot of explaining to do about China to remedy his reputation as a credible candidate when it comes to the future of the Catholic Church, some Vatican obeservers said.",
      "Cardinal P\u00e9ter Erd\u0151",
      "The first of six children, Hungarian Cardinal P\u00e9ter Erd\u0151 \u201ccirculates regularly in conservative blogs as one who would shift away from Francis,\u201d according to Monsignor Kevin Irwin, a research professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "\u201cA decided player for the conservative cardinals,\u201d Irwin said via email, adding that Erd\u0151, 72, now the archbishop of Budapest, is \u201ca highly trained canon lawyer\u201d who has written several erudite articles and books on the sources of canon law.",
      "Faggioli at Villanova agreed Erd\u0151 was a strong candidate, one who was much more conservative and \u201ca traditional Catholic when it comes to family, marriage, gay rights.\u201d",
      "Faggioli added that Erd\u0151 differed with Francis on the way the church should address immigration.",
      "While Francis often called for compassion toward migrants, he said Erd\u0151 was \u201cmore Eastern European and questions the ability to assimilate.\u201d",
      "Gabrielli said Erd\u0151 reminds \u201csome of us of John Paul II ... [which] comes from the fact that they were both raised under communist rule.\u201d",
      "He is also similar to Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who \u201cthought of Europe as key and the idea that Christianity of Europe was very important.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Tagle, who has been dubbed the \u201cAsian Pope Francis\u201d by some, would be presenting himself as a close follower of the recently deceased pontiff, according to Somerville-Meikle of the Catholic Union of Great Britain.",
      "Tagle, 67, a Filipino national who features his nickname, \u201cChito,\u201d on his X profile, is known as a champion of the poor in the Philippines and has campaigned on many social issues in his homeland, Somerville-Meikle said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly articulate and would be very able to extend Pope Francis\u2019 reflections theologically,\u201d said Gabrielli, adding that Tagle has been adept at taking Francis\u2019 ideas and running with them.",
      "However, Gabrielli said that Tagle\u2019s reputation took a bit of a hit when Francis ousted the management of the Vatican\u2019s international charitable organization, Caritas Internationalis, after an external review found management and morale problems at its head office.",
      "Tagle, who had served as the organization\u2019s president since May 2015, was among those relieved of their duties, despite having called for the review in the first place, Gabrielli said.",
      "\u201cThere might be questions resulting from that about his ability to manage,\u201d he added.",
      "However, since June, Tagle has been in charge of the Dicastery for Evangelization, one of the church's most important departments, and Gabrielli said he seemed to be doing \u201ca good job there.\u201d",
      "Other contenders",
      "Among the other candidates who might come up for consideration are the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, and Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, 77, the archbishop of Colombo in Sri Lanka.",
      "The general secretary of the Synod of Bishops, the Maltese Cardinal Mario Grech, and Cardinal Charles Muang Bo of Burma, the archbishop of Yangon, may also be considered.",
      "Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, the archbishop of Vienna, is also a \u201cwell respected\u201d figure who understands the importance of governing an international archdiocese while maintaining a \u201cmoderate line between being open-minded to dialogue about the future of the church but also keeping close to the tradition of the Catholic faith,\u201d NBC News\u2019 Lubov said.",
      "But at 80, \u201chis days as a candidate are probably behind him,\u201d Gabrielli said, although he added that Sch\u00f6nborn \u201cbefuddles people who try and label him as either conservative or liberal,\u201d which might lead some to see him as a compromise candidate.",
      "Age and experience may rule out Canadian Cardinal G\u00e9rald Lacroix, the archbishop of Quebec, because at 67, some may consider him too young, Faggioli said. \u201cI expect they will look for a candidate in their 70s,\u201d he added.",
      "Gabrielli added that Lacroix was \u201ca real pastor, people person. He\u2019s not a corporate in-his-office type, which I think reminds people of Francis. He really prioritizes evangelization, but I wonder if he has the global scope that some cardinals will look for.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The merch is out and available for a price on the Trump Organization website: $50 for a \u201cTrump 2028\u201d hat; $36 for a shirt that reads, \u201cTrump 2028 (Re-write the Rules).\u201d",
      "The rules aren\u2019t so easily undone. Donald Trump can\u2019t be elected again in 2028 under the constitutional amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Any number of Trump\u2019s Republican allies will tell you that a third term is inconceivable given the enormous hurdles required to pass a new amendment.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to run for another term,\u201d former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NBC News. But, he added, Trump has reason to talk about it: \"Don\u2019t underestimate the degree to which he believes any Trump-centered noise is good, because it starves his opponents.\"",
      "Yet Trump continues to flirt with the prospect of serving until 2033, when he would be 86 years old. Whether he\u2019ll follow through or not, his assertion that a third term is no joke is something that would-be-contenders ignore at their own peril.",
      "Teasing a third term freezes the 2028 GOP presidential field until aspiring candidates have a clearer understanding of whether and how far Trump intends to push the limits of the Constitution.",
      "Anyone who front runs Trump and mounts a campaign before he declares his intentions might offend the MAGA movement.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 none are likely to start building a campaign unless and until Trump concedes this term is his last.",
      "Doing so would invite \u201ctotal and complete rejection,\u201d said Steve Bannon, a senior White House official in Trump\u2019s first term who is exploring ways for Trump to serve a third term. \u201cTrump is MAGA; MAGA is Trump.\u201d",
      "Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, said that Trump\u2019s third-term musings \u201cparticularly impact JD Vance and Ron DeSantis and anyone else who wants the favor of Donald Trump. They know they have to stay out of the mix until Donald Trump gives the blessing to go after it and says that he would not be seeking a third term.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not likely to happen any time soon. The party expects Trump to draw out an announcement about his future as long as he can, according to a Republican who is close to possible 2028 candidates. The more Trump delays, the more he commands attention and averts the perception that he\u2019s a lame duck.",
      "The White House has considerable leverage at this point. No serious GOP presidential hopeful would want Trump's ire.",
      "Consider the case of DeSantis. Trump endorsed him in the 2018 Florida gubernatorial primary and viewed his subsequent 2024 presidential primary challenge as a betrayal.",
      "On top of that, Trump\u2019s political base began to distrust DeSantis after he jumped in the race against Trump, a sentiment that hasn\u2019t subsided. Before the GOP Iowa caucus last year, Laura Loomer, one of Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters, told DeSantis in the lobby of a hotel: \u201cYou killed your political career, and I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d",
      "The best way for putative candidates to stay on the right side of Trump is by going along with the notion that he might indeed run, a Trump political adviser said.",
      "\u201cI think anyone looking to 2028 is probably the first person to purchase one,\" said the adviser, referring to the \"Trump 2028\" hat, who was granted anonymity to share internal thinking.",
      "Vance may be better positioned than most rivals as Trump floats the idea of a third term. He has a built-in platform as a sitting vice president, complete with the perks that the job brings.",
      "At his disposal is a taxpayer-funded staff and airplane that he can use to build his foreign policy bona fides. It helps that his boss is a bit of a homebody and has eschewed extensive travel. This month, Vance met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome to discuss tariffs. He had an audience with Pope Francis shortly before the pontiff's death.",
      "With Trump controlling the Republican National Committee, Vance last month became the group\u2019s finance chairman, allowing him to befriend well-heeled donors who can be helpful to a future campaign.",
      "Vance has made no movements toward his own presidential run and has yet to seriously think about the idea, a source close to the vice president said.",
      "When asked if he views himself as Trump\u2019s successor, Vance insisted last month that his own White House bid was not an urgent priority but acknowledged the circumstances under which he\u2019d become a strong candidate. He also suggested that any serious moves would come after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cIf I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cNow, like, yeah, in two and a half years, will that become harder? Will people be more focused on politics than on what the White House is maybe doing that particular day? Maybe.\u201d",
      "Others can\u2019t be as confident. DeSantis faces term limitations and will be out of office in 2027, so he won\u2019t have the stage that the Florida governor\u2019s office provides. Still, that might not dampen his ambitions.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely believes he can still be president. While most on the outside looking in do not think he has viability, that\u2019s just not how he thinks. It\u2019s not how he views the world,\u201d a longtime DeSantis ally said.",
      "If Trump finds a way to run, though, his grip on the GOP is such that  serious opposition may well evaporate.",
      "The most direct way for Trump to circumvent the 22nd amendment is to change it. But that\u2019s nearly an insurmountable obstacle in these polarized times, requiring three-quarters of the states to go along, for starters.",
      "More fanciful ideas for overcoming the legal barrier involves a scenario in which Vance runs for president and picks Trump as his running mate. If they win, Vance then steps aside and Trump becomes president again.",
      "Were Vance to go along with that, attention might turn from the 22nd Amendment to the 12th. That amendment states that no one who is ineligible under the Constitution to be president shall be eligible to serve as vice president.",
      "So, the question then becomes, is Trump ineligible to be Vance\u2019s running mate given that he\u2019s barred under the 22nd Amendment from being elected to a third term? And, here, the answer may come down to a careful textual reading of the two amendments at issue.",
      "An argument might be made that because the 22nd Amendment says only that Trump can\u2019t be elected president a third time, that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be president if Vance were to resign and turn the job over to him.",
      "Such a scenario, \u201cis contrary to the intent of the amendments,\u201d but is not \u201csquarely foreclosed by the words,\u201d said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School (and the great, great grandson of former President Theodore Roosevelt).",
      "Whether Vance would go along is a mystery. He has not publicly discussed the possibility, and spokespeople and advisers have declined requests to elaborate on what Vance is thinking about such a  2028 calculus.",
      "In an interview with Trump on April 22, Time magazine asked his thoughts about a swap with his number two.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing a good job.\u201d",
      "While \u201cthere are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in loopholes. I don\u2019t believe in using loopholes.\u201d",
      "Keeping the nation guessing, it turns out, is paying off. On Thursday, none other than the president\u2019s second-oldest son, Eric Trump, posed for a picture on X, smiling and sporting a \u201cTrump 2028\u201d hat."

      "Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent survivors of\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sexual abuse, has died by suicide, her family said Friday.",
      "Giuffre, 41, died in Neergabby, Australia, where she had been living for several years.",
      "Giuffre was one of the earliest and loudest voices calling for criminal charges against Epstein and his enablers. Other Epstein abuse survivors later credited her with giving them the courage to speak out.",
      "She also provided critical information to law enforcement that contributed to the investigation into and later the conviction of Epstein\u2019s associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other investigations by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.",
      "\"It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,\" her family said in a statement to NBC News. \"She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.\"",
      "\"Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors,\" the statement said.\u00a0\u201cIn the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.\"",
      "Raised primarily in Florida, Giuffre had a troubled childhood. She said she was abused by a family friend, triggering a downward spiral that led to her living on the streets for a time as a teenager.",
      "She was attempting to rebuild her life when she met Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s close confidant. Maxwell groomed her to be sexually abused by Epstein, and that abuse continued from 1999 to 2002, according to Giuffre. Giuffre also alleged that Epstein trafficked her to his powerful friends, including Prince Andrew and French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel.",
      "Epstein, a wealthy financier, died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Maxwell, a former British socialite, was found guilty on five counts of sex trafficking in 2021 for her role in recruiting young girls to be abused by Epstein.",
      "Giuffre filed a federal lawsuit against Andrew in 2021, alleging that he sexually abused her when she was 17. Andrew, who stepped back from his duties as an active royal as controversy related to Epstein swirled around him, agreed to settle the case for an undisclosed amount in 2022. He has denied having sex with her.",
      "Brunel, who headed several modeling agencies, was charged with sexual harassment and the rape of at least one minor in December 2020. He denied wrongdoing and died by suicide in his jail cell in February 2022.",
      "Several months prior, Giuffre testified against Brunel in a Paris courtroom in June 2021. In an interview after her daylong closed-door testimony, Giuffre said she appeared in court to be a voice for the victims and to make sure Brunel was brought to justice.",
      "\u201cI wanted Brunel to know that he no longer has the power over me,\u201d Giuffre said, \u201cthat I am a grown woman now and I\u2019ve decided to hold him accountable for what he did to me and so many others.\u201d",
      "Giuffre moved to Australia with her husband before Epstein\u2019s 2019 arrest. The couple has three children.",
      "Her brother, Danny Wilson, told NBC News she \"pushed so hard to snuff the evil out\" of the world.",
      "\"Her biggest push was, 'If I don\u2019t do this, nobody\u2019s going to do it,'\" he said, regarding her advocacy. \"She was in real physical pain \u2014 suffered from renal failure.\u00a0But I think that the mental pain was worse.\"",
      "The Epstein story received renewed attention during the most recent presidential election, and in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi released a collection of Epstein-related files to right-wing media figures and then to the public.",
      "Though the release was widely panned for containing information that was almost entirely previously public, the lead-up to its release \u2014 including concerns about the disclosure of sensitive or personally identifying information about victims \u2014 had been a source of distress and anxiety for victims in recent months, multiple victims told NBC News.",
      "Giuffre\u2019s lawyer, Sigrid McCawley, described her as a \u201cdear friend and an incredible champion for other victims.\u201d",
      "Those who were close to Giuffre said they remembered her as a fighter.",
      "\"Virginia was one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honor to know,\" her representative, Dini von Mueffling, said.",
      "And McCawley said, \u201cHer courage pushed me to fight harder, and her strength was awe-inspiring.\"",
      "In an interview for a \"Dateline\" NBC special on Epstein that aired before authorities charged Maxwell and Brunel, Giuffre urged law enforcement to act.",
      "\"Take us serious,\" she said. \"We matter.\"",

      "Khorram\u2019s role in Combs\u2019 trial, if any, is unclear. She has not been charged with any crimes and is not named in the indictment, which alleges Combs led a criminal enterprise that engaged in kidnapping, arson and bribery over the course of two decades. Last month, Khorram publicly denied \u201caiding and abetting the sexual assault of anyone.\u201d",

They view themselves as above that, and they\u2019re going to ultimately be the beneficiaries of it, unfortunately, but they need their workers, people who can execute on their orders to accomplish the goals of the criminal scheme.\u201d",

      "NBC News requested interviews with the three accusers either directly or through their attorneys. Only one responded, but declined to answer specific questions about the suit.",

These false allegations of my involvement are causing irreparable and incalculable damage to my reputation and the emotional well-being of myself and my family. I have never condoned or aided and abetted the sexual assault of anyone. Nor have I ever drugged anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea that I could be accused of playing a role in \u2014 or even being a bystander to \u2014 the rape of anyone is beyond upsetting, disturbing, and unthinkable.

      "Seven G\u00fczel, who described herself in a complaint filed in February as an aspiring signed artist when she met Combs in the fall of 2017, said Combs groomed her before sexually assaulting and raping her on multiple occasions. She said she fell into a cycle of abuse with Combs, who plied her with alcohol and drugs.",
      "She alleges that Khorram aided in the alleged abuse by arranging places and transportation for it to occur, contacting her on Combs\u2019 behalf and \u201cgenerally\u201d covering up the abuse.

      "Jones\u2019 suit alleges Combs sexually harassed and assaulted him, tried to \u201cgroom\u201d him into having sex with another man and forced him to hire sex workers and participate in sex acts with them. The suit says that when Jones expressed to Khorram his discomfort about Combs\u2019 advances, she dismissed it as friendly horseplay, telling Jones it was Combs\u2019 way of \u201cshowing that he likes you.\u201d",
      "On several occasions when Combs would undress and walk around his home naked, Khorram would say she was leaving and disappear, Jones said.",
      "\u201cKK\u2019s hypocrisy is breathtaking at best and or enabling at worst,\u201d the suit says. Jones also says in the lawsuit that he saw Khorram order her assistants to keep Combs \u201chigh\u201d on gummies and pills, and that she required all employees, \u201cfrom the butler to the chef to the housekeepers,\u201d to carry a pouch or fanny pack filled with cocaine, ecstasy, tusi (a combination of ecstasy and cocaine in a pink powder) and other drugs.",
      "Khorram would also order and pay sex workers for Combs, according to the suit. Jones claimed to have a text message from Khorram asking him to contact a particular sex worker.",
      "Jones was terrified of Combs and felt he could not tell him no, he said in the suit. In response, a representative for Combs said: \u201cMr. Jones\u2019s lawsuit is pure fiction \u2014 a shameless attempt to create media hype and extract a quick settlement. There was no RICO conspiracy, and Mr. Jones was not threatened, groomed, assaulted, or trafficked. We look forward to proving \u2014 in a court of law \u2014 that all of Mr. Jones\u2019s claims are made-up and must be dismissed.\u201d",
      "In a response to Jones\u2019 lawsuit filed on April 7, Khorram denied all the allegations.",
      "Phillip Pines, 40, said in a lawsuit filed in December that he worked as a senior executive assistant to Combs for about two years, from December 2019 through Dec. 29, 2021, and reported directly to Combs and Khorram.",
      "He named the two in a lawsuit filed in December and participated in Investigation Discovery\u2019s docuseries \u201cThe Fall of Diddy,\u201d which debuted in January.",
      "Pines said in his lawsuit he once witnessed Combs kick a guest in the buttocks and stomach in Miami, and that when he told Khorram about it and said he was upset, she told him never to speak about it and that \u201cthere are repercussions that can happen if he did.\u201d",
      "Pines alleged in the suit the guest was given \u201cnice gifts and a nice dinner\u201d to make up for it. In the documentary, Pines said the guest was a woman.",
      "Pines\u2019 suit also said that when he traveled with Combs, Combs and Khorram put him in charge of the \u201cMVP\u201d bag, a black Gucci bag that contained illicit drugs and sex toys.",
      "Lesko, the former federal prosecutor, said it is likely prosecutors have already sought to compel Khorram\u2019s testimony, or are in the process of doing so.",
      "\u201cI strongly suspect that the government is interacting closely with Diddy\u2019s inner circle, with his high-level employees and associates, one way or the other, to try to unravel the story here,\u201d Lesko said."

    "story": [
      "Florida is poised to become the second state to ban the long-standing practice of adding fluoride to public water systems. State senators have already cleared a bill that would prohibit community water fluoridation, and Florida\u2019s House is expected to vote on a similar bill in the coming week.",
      "The word \u201cfluoride\u201d isn\u2019t found anywhere in the Florida Farm Bill, but it would be included because the legislation aims to ban \u201cthe use of certain additives in a water system\u201d throughout the state.",
      "If Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signs the bill, Florida will become the second to ban fluoride from water supplies. Utah\u2019s Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, signed a bill in late March that prohibits any person or government entity from adding the cavity-fighting mineral from the state\u2019s water systems. The Utah rule will go into effect on May 7.",
      "Similar legislation is making its way through other states, including Kentucky, Massachusetts and Nebraska.",
      "In Wisconsin, nearly 80 communities have already voted to stop adding fluoride, according to the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources, and others in the state are considering a ban. And Union County in North Carolina voted last year to remove fluoride from drinking water.",
      "Like the anti-vaccine movement, the push to pull fluoride from water has been gaining momentum for several decades. It\u2019s grown more powerful with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Earlier this month, Kennedy said he was planning to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoride be added to water supplies.",
      "The agency doesn\u2019t make official recommendations on fluoride, however. Those come from the U.S. Public Health Service, composed of members from various federal health public health agencies.",
      "He also said at the event, without providing evidence, that \u201cwe know that there is no systemic advantage\u201d to preventing tooth decay by drinking fluoridated water. \u201cYou can achieve that benefit from brushing teeth.\u201d",
      "Water fluoridation has long been heralded as one of the top public health initiatives of the last century for its ability to drive down tooth decay.",
      "While defending fluoride in a Florida Senate debate on April 16, Sen. Tina Scott Polsky, a Democrat, said, \u201cFind me a dentist who thinks we should get rid of fluoride.\u201d The bill passed the Senate on April 16. The Florida House is controlled by Republicans and is expected to vote against fluoridation.",
      "Lorna Koci, head of the Utah Oral Health Coalition, an advocacy group that promotes oral health initiatives among Medicaid beneficiaries, said the movement against fluoride has nothing to do with health and science. \u201cIt really is a political issue,\u201d she said.",
      "Kennedy, who has no training in medicine or dentistry, has previously referred to fluoride as \u201cindustrial waste\u201d on the social media platform X and said on MSNBC that the faster the mineral goes away, the better.",
      "A \u2018four-letter word\u2019",
      "Historically, dentists and other oral health experts would have been vocal defenders of fluoride. Now, many feel that they\u2019re in a losing battle against the anti-fluoride movement and worry about speaking publicly in favor of the mineral.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a four-letter word,\u201d a public health dentist in the Southeast said. The mere mention of fluoride, even in the context of public education, is forbidden by superiors, the staffer said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t defend the science we believe in,\u201d said another public health dentist in the Upper Midwest. Opposition to both fluoride and vaccines has become more vocal locally because of what\u2019s happening on the national level, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically giving them a boost.\u201d Public health dentists work with a state or county to increase dental care access in underserved communities and promote oral health overall.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration pulled more than $11 billion earmarked for state public health departments. As part of the mass layoffs at health agencies ordered by Kennedy, HHS gutted the CDC\u2019s oral health division, which provides funds to states and local jurisdictions to promote good dental health practices, including the use of fluoride.",
      "Dentists argue that while fluoridated toothpaste is critical in preventing cavities, underserved communities may not be able to afford it. Many, they say, are unable to go to a dentist for fluoride treatments.",
      "Dr. Johnny Johnson, a pediatric dentist and president of the American Fluoridation Society, a fluoride advocacy group, said legislators opposed to water fluoridation \u201cneed to be skewered over total disregard for our residents\u2019 health.\u201d",
      "An HHS spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a question about how the federal government might address those disparities.",
      "Speaking publicly about the benefits of the mineral might result in a target on the backs of health departments already strapped for cash, fluoride advocates say.",
      "A year ago, \u201cfluoride was fine to bring up\u201d in discussions with public health leaders, said Koci.",
      "Now, \u201cI think many people in public health are feeling like they need to just lay low. It\u2019s probably very risky to be taking a position on a topic that is so political and controversial.\u201d",
      "Major public health groups, including the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC, support the use of fluoridated water. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%.",
      "Before the Florida Senate vote, more than a dozen jurisdictions in the state, including Seminole County, had banned water fluoridation despite decades of the mineral being safely used in the water supply and evidence that it fights cavities.",
      "In November 2024, the state\u2019s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, said communities should stop adding fluoride to drinking water because of what he called \u201cneuropsychiatric risk.\u201d",
      "At least one of those bans has been overruled. Miami Mayor Daniella Levine Cava promised to veto her county commissioners\u2019 vote to remove fluoride.",
      "\u201cWhile it may be relatively simple to stop adding fluoride as directed in the resolution, the long-term effects of doing so are anything but simple, and so we must consider the long-term consequences,\u201d Levine Cava said during a news conference earlier this month. \u201cEnding fluoridation could have real and lasting harm, especially for children and families who cannot afford regular dental care.\u201d",
      "Similar to the anti-vaccine movement, which has focused on widely debunked research associating the mumps, measles and rubella shots with autism, groups opposed to fluoride tend to seize on a study that suggests the mineral is a neurotoxin that lowers children\u2019s level of intelligence.",
      "A study published in 2019 suggested that IQ levels were slightly lower in kids whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine during pregnancy. The research was far from conclusive.",
      "Other studies looking at how fluoride affects children\u2019s brains have been called \u201clow quality\u201d by health scientists and were conducted in other countries.",
      "Another public health dentist said that faced with extensive funding cuts for any public health measures, fluoride isn\u2019t \u201cthe hill they want to die on.\u201d",
      "Dentists predict they\u2019ll see a jump in dental decay, especially among kids, in the coming years.",
      "Dr. Tom Reid, president of the Wisconsin Dental Association, said that within the next three to five years, those towns can expect to see a significant increase in rates of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening,\u201d Reid said. Dentists aren\u2019t pushing for fluoride for their own benefit, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to act in what is the best for the health of our patients, for the health of our communities.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s what happened in the Canadian city of Calgary, for example, after leaders there voted to remove fluoride from public water in 2011. A decade later, they voted to reinstate community water fluoridation amid a significant rise in cavities among kids.",
      "In Seminole County, Florida, which voted earlier this month to get fluoride out of the water system, utilities director Johnny Edwards said during the meeting that it would save the county at least $100,000.",
      "When asked whether the county would set aside that money to treat a potential increase in cavities, Chris Patton, a spokesman for the county, chuckled. No, he said, it will simply be reabsorbed into the county\u2019s utilities department."

      "When a lifesaving drug \u2014 insulin \u2014 is used as a murder weapon, medical professionals are likely unprepared to consider that the difficult-to-detect medication was used to commit a crime, according to a forensic pathologist who worked on the recent case of a West Virginia pharmacist convicted of fatally dosing her husband.",
      "Dr. Paul Uribe, a former military medical examiner who consults as a pathologist across the United States and helped solve a string of insulin murders at a West Virginia veterans hospital, told NBC News that there appear to be few protocols showing pathologists and emergency room doctors how to best handle the cases.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stumble across an insulin homicide,\u201d Uribe said. \u201cYou have to have a suspect and you have to look for it, because if you\u2019re not looking for it, you\u2019re not going to find it.\u201d",
      "While such crimes are rare, Uribe said, some recent cases in the U.S. have had a staggering number of victims. In Pennsylvania, a nurse confessed to trying to kill 19 people with insulin at five facilities between 2020 and 2023. Seventeen of her patients died. At the West Virginia veterans hospital, a nurse admitted in 2021 to killing seven elderly patients with insulin.",
      "Uribe said he knows of no protocols promoted by\u00a0organizations for ER\u00a0doctors or medical examiners and knows of only one state \u2014 West Virginia \u2014 where lawmakers have sought to reckon with this apparent lack of awareness. A bill introduced this year in the state Legislature seeks to require emergency rooms to test patients for insulin when they\u2019re admitted with possible symptoms of insulin poisoning.",
      "Jonathan Jones, the former president of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, said that while the organization is concerned about insulin overdoses, it does not believe in \u201clegislating medical care.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe best medical care is provided by properly educated, trained and board-certified physicians and not by legislators,\u201d he said in an email to NBC News. \u201cWe believe in continuing medical education around this issue and all others applicable to the physician\u2019s specialty but oppose treatment mandates and repercussions.\u201d",
      "He did not respond to a request for comment about whether ERs need stronger guidelines.",
      "Asked if forensic pathologists need better protocols, Reade Quinton, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, said: \u201cI am not sure that is the right question. What medical examiners need is unobstructed access to scene information, witness statements and medical records so we can perform a complete and independent death investigation.\u201d",
      "The lead sponsor of the West Virginia bill did not respond to requests for comment. But the parents of Michael Cochran \u2014 who was killed by his pharmacist wife and for whom the bill is named \u2014 believe the legislation could serve as a model for the country. And it could help others avoid the gut-wrenching search for answers that they endured for years.",
      "\u201cThey won\u2019t have to wait for a result like we had to wait,\u201d Cochran\u2019s mother, Donna Bolt, told \u201cDateline.\u201d \u201cSix years.\u201d",
      "Seven dead patients at VA hospital",
      "Uribe\u2019s first insulin homicide case was at the veterans hospital in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Then a pathologist with the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, Uribe\u00a0said he was asked in late 2018 to examine a series of mysterious deaths among elderly patients, all of whom were found to have had severe hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.",
      "The condition can be caused by excessively high doses of insulin, which acts as a lifesaving regulator of blood sugar for people with diabetes.",
      "Some of the veterans were diabetic, Uribe recalled, but others were not. He said he was asked to find a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that could prove insulin was the murder weapon.",
      "For emergency room physicians and pathologists, he said, this can be a difficult task because of how quickly the body metabolizes insulin. The test cited in the West Virginia legislation \u2014 known as a \u201cc-peptide\u201d test \u2014 can measure insulin, Uribe said, but timing is key: It has to be conducted before doctors provide treatment for low blood sugar, he said.",
      "\u201cBecause once you give that person glucose, that triggers the body\u2019s natural release of insulin, and it\u2019ll throw off the insulin c-peptide measure,\u201d he said.",
      "Many smaller hospitals often do not have the tests available, he added.",
      "Uribe cited two possible methods for pathologists to document insulin. One of the most common ways of administering the medication is through an injection, and it can briefly linger in the body\u2019s tissue at an injection site, he said. Researchers have also documented insulin in postmortem vitreous fluid, a substance found in the eyeball, he said.",
      "In West Virginia, the bodies of seven veterans were exhumed and Uribe tested injection site tissue samples, he said. The tests revealed trace amounts of insulin in some of the victims, including those who were not diabetic and had never been prescribed the medication, he said.",
      "\u201cThat was the definitive proof they had been injected with insulin,\u201d he said.",
      "Reta Mays, a nursing assistant at the hospital, was eventually identified as a suspect in the killings. She admitted to administering the lethal doses, pleading guilty to seven counts of second-degree murder and one count of assault with intent to commit murder in connection with the death of an eighth man. Mays was sentenced to seven life sentences.",
      "A fatal dose from a pharmacist",
      "In Uribe\u2019s second case, pharmacist Natalie Cochran was convicted in January of giving her husband a fatal dose of the drug in a plot that prosecutors said was aimed at covering up a multimillion-dollar fraud that she perpetrated on friends and family.",
      "But it took years for the case to be resolved.",
      "In February\u00a02019, Michael Cochran was hospitalized in an unresponsive state before he was removed from a ventilator and placed in hospice. He was 38. His death certificate listed his manner of death as \u201cnatural.\u201d",
      "Michael Cochran\u2019s emergency room records showed that when he was admitted to the hospital, his blood sugar had plummeted, even though he had no history of diabetes, Uribe said.\u00a0No insulin test was done at the time, he said.",
      "But Tim Bledsoe, a detective with the West Virginia State Police, came to suspect that Natalie Cochran may have played a role in her husband\u2019s death, and during a search of her home, he discovered a partially used vial of insulin in her fridge.",
      "Knowing that no one in the home was diabetic, he asked Natalie Cochran about the vial, Bledsoe told \u201cDateline.\u201d\u00a0She told the detective she kept it there for a neighbor\u2019s diabetic son, Bledsoe said. But the neighbor, Jennifer Davis, denied this and told \u201cDateline\u201d that Natalie Cochran said she\u2019d asked for the insulin for herself, claiming that she was using it to recover from a cancer diagnosis that prosecutors later said she faked.",
      "She asked for the insulin the morning Michael Cochran first became sick, Davis said.",
      "Two years after Michael Cochran\u2019s death, his wife was indicted on a murder charge. An autopsy had been performed seven months after his death, but by then his body was in an advanced state of decomposition and the medical examiner ruled his cause of death undetermined, Bledsoe said.",
      "It isn\u2019t clear why an autopsy was not done immediately after his death, nor is it clear if any steps were taken in the examination to try and document postmortem insulin. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, which oversees the state medical examiner, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Uribe said it\u2019s unlikely any postmortem evidence of insulin could have been found given how much time passed between when Michael Cochran would have been given the drug and when he died.",
      "The undetermined finding, combined with a lack of physical evidence, led the Raleigh County district attorney to drop the case, according to the county\u2019s current top prosecutor, Tom Truman.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the medical examiner saying homicide, you\u2019ve got a big problem,\u201d he told \u201cDateline.\u201d",
      "Another exhumation \u2014 and then a conviction",
      "But two years later, the charge was refiled after Uribe was asked to examine the case. During a second exhumation and autopsy, Uribe said that he searched for possible injection sites but that Michael Cochran\u2019s remains were skeletal by that point and the examination yielded nothing.",
      "Still, Uribe said no other reason that could explain Michael Cochran\u2019s plummeting blood sugar \u2014 such as sepsis or a rampant infection \u2014 had been documented in his medical records. Combined with other circumstances surrounding Michael Cochran\u2019s death, Uribe ruled the death an insulin homicide.",
      "At trial, an endocrinologist who testified for the prosecution agreed that no other explanation could account for Michael Cochran\u2019s hypoglycemia.",
      "Natalie Cochran\u2019s lawyers acknowledged that she defrauded friends and relatives \u2014 she\u2019d pleaded guilty in a separate federal fraud and money laundering case \u2014 but they said she had nothing to do with\u00a0her husband\u2019s\u00a0death, which they attributed to a lethal mix of workout supplements, steroids and possibly his own use of insulin.",
      "On Jan. 29, after two hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Natalie Cochran of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "To Uribe, this case and the killings at the veteran\u2019s hospital underscore the need for better insulin overdose guidelines.",
      "For physicians, he said, those protocols could include watching out for red flags like severely low, unexplained blood sugar in a nondiabetic person, or unexplained low potassium, known as hypokalemia, which can also be fatal and caused by excessive insulin.",
      "And they need to ensure that they administer a c-peptide test before treatment, he said.",
      "Pathologists should search for possible injection sites, he said, and they should try testing vitreous fluid, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to detect that in the vitreous fluid of someone who\u2019s not a diabetic, who\u2019s never been prescribed this medication and has no history of them being injected, that could legitimately tell you something,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Thursday night was the kind of scene the Los Angeles Clippers have dreamed about for nearly a decade: a raucous, sold-out crowd erupting in cheers following the first playoff win in their own arena.",
      "After taking a resounding 2-1 lead in their first-round series against Denver, the Clippers are the NBA championship contender that no one predicted.",
      "And it has been made possible by the career renaissance few saw coming.",
      "In recent weeks, Kawhi Leonard has looked every bit the elite scorer and perimeter defender the Clippers thought they were getting in 2019 when Leonard, weeks removed from earning the second NBA Finals MVP honor of his career, signed with the Clippers in a free-agency coup.",
      "Yet that was six years ago, a lifetime in a league where championship windows open rarely and close quickly.",
      "\"The best thing for him was taking the summer off and getting right,\" said an executive from a rival team. \"I just can't believe how skinny he looks. He just looks like he's so much lighter and moving so much better and playing back to the way he was before. It's just amazing.\"",
      "Leonard has looked this dominant in the postseason before while in a Clippers uniform, starting in 2021. But during a second-round series against Utah, just as Leonard and Paul George were playing their best as teammates, Leonard took an innocuous bump from Utah's Joe Ingles on a fast break and missed the rest of that postseason, and the entire 2021-22 season, as well, with a knee injury that required surgery.",
      "Clippers playoff runs in 2023 and 2024 also ended with Leonard injured \u2014 a string of strains, inflammation and partial and complete tears to knee ligaments that left other teams so scared about his ability to stay on the court that in 2023, executives around the NBA described his trade value as zilch.",
      "Entering this season, his premature endings to past campaigns, along with the departure of George in free agency, lowered his team\u2019s championship expectations. Oddsmakers put the Clippers\u2019 over-under for victories at 35.5 wins. Leonard didn\u2019t even make his season debut until early January \u2014 when half the season was over.",
      "Yet the Clippers finished with 50 wins anyway, after winning 18 of their last 21 games. And Leonard averaged 25.7 points on 52% shooting, including 42% on three-pointers, over his final 19 games.",
      "His injury history has led fans, scouts and executives around the league to continue to hold their breath as they wait to see how long Leonard can remain healthy while playing heavy minutes.",
      "\"If you have watched Kawhi closely enough you know what's possible,\" said Oscar-winning director and writer Phil Lord, a longtime Clippers fan. \"He made it possible. His elite work ethic has led once again to elite play. But I never want to see Joe Ingles anywhere near him ever again.\"",
      "Yet for now, Leonard has produced emphatic playoff moments, such as his 39 points while missing only four shots in a Game 2 win to even the Clippers\u2019 series with Denver. In Game 3, he scored 21 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.",

      "NFL draft: Biggest winners, losers of the first round",
      "Former Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson arrested on DWI charge",
      "Why are quarterbacks going undrafted this year?",
      "\u201cThis is what Kawhi lives for,\u201d Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said this week. \u201cAnd we know if we have a healthy Kawhi, we can win any series.\u201d",
      "Leonard himself could have predicted this. After returning from a knee injury following the 2023 season, he routinely described his recovery as a two-year timeline that he wasn\u2019t looking to rush by \u201cskipping steps.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnybody in the business that is playing knows how hard it is to come back from injury or playing in the NBA. They understand what we all go through and what I went through,\u201d Leonard said after the win.",
      "As a beat reporter who covered Leonard daily during his first five seasons in Los Angeles, I have never been around a more routine-oriented player. Each pregame warmup was done at the same speed, with the same repetitions and drills, against the same assistant coaches. The irony that complicated his team\u2019s championship ambitions, however, was that it was never predictable whether Leonard would be on the court.",
      "It had even led to criticism of Leonard\u2019s desire to play. But Clint Parks, a skills trainer who worked with Leonard as a teenager and early during his NBA career, said that could not be further from the motivation that has allowed Leonard to turn from an overlooked college recruit and NBA role player at the beginning of his career into a No. 1 option for a title team.",
      "\u201cHis self-belief from Day 1 has always been one of one. He\u2019s never not believed in himself at the highest, highest level,\u201d Parks said. \u201cHe\u2019s always had this work ethic. He\u2019s always been focused. He\u2019s always been a self-starter. At 14, he said he wanted to be one of the best to ever play basketball. That was his thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver the years, he\u2019s pushed toward that, and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s become, regardless of the injuries. People always talk about, \u2018Oh, he could be top 10 if he didn\u2019t miss all that time and wasn\u2019t injured.\u2019 Shoot, if he can finish the job and somehow bring home a championship to the Clippers, he will still be top 10 all time with all the injuries and everything and all the time he\u2019s missed.\u201d",
      "Each of the last two seasons, Leonard had produced stretches that resembled a return to the form that made him a six-time All-Star, two-time defensive player of the year and a member of the NBA\u2019s team of the 75 all-time players. Yet in 2023, after a dominating start to a first-round playoff series against Phoenix, Leonard suffered a season-ending knee injury. And last year, after the Clippers looked to be the NBA\u2019s best team for a two-month stretch, he hobbled out of the playoffs yet again in a loss to Dallas.",
      "The feeling around the league one year ago, said the rival executive, \u201cwas just like, \u2018Uh-oh, here we go again.\u2019\u201d",
      "Playing under a carefully monitored ramp-up of his workload, it took Leonard one month after his season debut to crack 30 minutes for the first time. One month later, in March, he passed the 40-minute mark. And in the playoffs, he is passing most expectations for how this 33-year-old superstar could still perform.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s back to looking like the best player in the world,\u201d Parks said."

In response, a representative for Combs said: \u201cMr. Jones\u2019s lawsuit is pure fiction \u2014 a shameless attempt to create media hype and extract a quick settlement. There was no RICO conspiracy, and Mr. Jones was not threatened, groomed, assaulted, or trafficked. We look forward to proving \u2014 in a court of law \u2014 that all of Mr. Jones\u2019s claims are made-up and must be dismissed.\u201d",
      "In a response to Jones\u2019 lawsuit filed on April 7, Khorram denied all the allegations.",
      "Phillip Pines, 40, said in a lawsuit filed in December that he worked as a senior executive assistant to Combs for about two years, from December 2019 through Dec. 29, 2021, and reported directly to Combs and Khorram.",
      "He named the two in a lawsuit filed in December and participated in Investigation Discovery\u2019s docuseries \u201cThe Fall of Diddy,\u201d which debuted in January.",
      "Pines said in his lawsuit he once witnessed Combs kick a guest in the buttocks and stomach in Miami, and that when he told Khorram about it and said he was upset, she told him never to speak about it and that \u201cthere are repercussions that can happen if he did.\u201d",
      "Pines alleged in the suit the guest was given \u201cnice gifts and a nice dinner\u201d to make up for it. In the documentary, Pines said the guest was a woman.",
      "Pines\u2019 suit also said that when he traveled with Combs, Combs and Khorram put him in charge of the \u201cMVP\u201d bag, a black Gucci bag that contained illicit drugs and sex toys.",
      "Lesko, the former federal prosecutor, said it is likely prosecutors have already sought to compel Khorram\u2019s testimony, or are in the process of doing so.",
      "\u201cI strongly suspect that the government is interacting closely with Diddy\u2019s inner circle, with his high-level employees and associates, one way or the other, to try to unravel the story here,\u201d Lesko said."

    "story": [
      "Florida is poised to become the second state to ban the long-standing practice of adding fluoride to public water systems. State senators have already cleared a bill that would prohibit community water fluoridation, and Florida\u2019s House is expected to vote on a similar bill in the coming week.",
      "The word \u201cfluoride\u201d isn\u2019t found anywhere in the Florida Farm Bill, but it would be included because the legislation aims to ban \u201cthe use of certain additives in a water system\u201d throughout the state.",
      "If Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signs the bill, Florida will become the second to ban fluoride from water supplies. Utah\u2019s Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, signed a bill in late March that prohibits any person or government entity from adding the cavity-fighting mineral from the state\u2019s water systems. The Utah rule will go into effect on May 7.",
      "Similar legislation is making its way through other states, including Kentucky, Massachusetts and Nebraska.",
      "In Wisconsin, nearly 80 communities have already voted to stop adding fluoride, according to the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources, and others in the state are considering a ban. And Union County in North Carolina voted last year to remove fluoride from drinking water.",
      "Like the anti-vaccine movement, the push to pull fluoride from water has been gaining momentum for several decades. It\u2019s grown more powerful with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Earlier this month, Kennedy said he was planning to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoride be added to water supplies.",
      "The agency doesn\u2019t make official recommendations on fluoride, however. Those come from the U.S. Public Health Service, composed of members from various federal health public health agencies.",
      "He also said at the event, without providing evidence, that \u201cwe know that there is no systemic advantage\u201d to preventing tooth decay by drinking fluoridated water. \u201cYou can achieve that benefit from brushing teeth.\u201d",
      "Water fluoridation has long been heralded as one of the top public health initiatives of the last century for its ability to drive down tooth decay.",
      "While defending fluoride in a Florida Senate debate on April 16, Sen. Tina Scott Polsky, a Democrat, said, \u201cFind me a dentist who thinks we should get rid of fluoride.\u201d The bill passed the Senate on April 16. The Florida House is controlled by Republicans and is expected to vote against fluoridation.",
      "Lorna Koci, head of the Utah Oral Health Coalition, an advocacy group that promotes oral health initiatives among Medicaid beneficiaries, said the movement against fluoride has nothing to do with health and science. \u201cIt really is a political issue,\u201d she said.",
      "Kennedy, who has no training in medicine or dentistry, has previously referred to fluoride as \u201cindustrial waste\u201d on the social media platform X and said on MSNBC that the faster the mineral goes away, the better.",
      "A \u2018four-letter word\u2019",
      "Historically, dentists and other oral health experts would have been vocal defenders of fluoride. Now, many feel that they\u2019re in a losing battle against the anti-fluoride movement and worry about speaking publicly in favor of the mineral.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a four-letter word,\u201d a public health dentist in the Southeast said. The mere mention of fluoride, even in the context of public education, is forbidden by superiors, the staffer said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t defend the science we believe in,\u201d said another public health dentist in the Upper Midwest. Opposition to both fluoride and vaccines has become more vocal locally because of what\u2019s happening on the national level, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically giving them a boost.\u201d Public health dentists work with a state or county to increase dental care access in underserved communities and promote oral health overall.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration pulled more than $11 billion earmarked for state public health departments. As part of the mass layoffs at health agencies ordered by Kennedy, HHS gutted the CDC\u2019s oral health division, which provides funds to states and local jurisdictions to promote good dental health practices, including the use of fluoride.",
      "Dentists argue that while fluoridated toothpaste is critical in preventing cavities, underserved communities may not be able to afford it. Many, they say, are unable to go to a dentist for fluoride treatments.",
      "Dr. Johnny Johnson, a pediatric dentist and president of the American Fluoridation Society, a fluoride advocacy group, said legislators opposed to water fluoridation \u201cneed to be skewered over total disregard for our residents\u2019 health.\u201d",
      "An HHS spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a question about how the federal government might address those disparities.",
      "Speaking publicly about the benefits of the mineral might result in a target on the backs of health departments already strapped for cash, fluoride advocates say.",
      "A year ago, \u201cfluoride was fine to bring up\u201d in discussions with public health leaders, said Koci.",
      "Now, \u201cI think many people in public health are feeling like they need to just lay low. It\u2019s probably very risky to be taking a position on a topic that is so political and controversial.\u201d",
      "Major public health groups, including the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC, support the use of fluoridated water. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%.",
      "Before the Florida Senate vote, more than a dozen jurisdictions in the state, including Seminole County, had banned water fluoridation despite decades of the mineral being safely used in the water supply and evidence that it fights cavities.",
      "In November 2024, the state\u2019s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, said communities should stop adding fluoride to drinking water because of what he called \u201cneuropsychiatric risk.\u201d",
      "At least one of those bans has been overruled. Miami Mayor Daniella Levine Cava promised to veto her county commissioners\u2019 vote to remove fluoride.",
      "\u201cWhile it may be relatively simple to stop adding fluoride as directed in the resolution, the long-term effects of doing so are anything but simple, and so we must consider the long-term consequences,\u201d Levine Cava said during a news conference earlier this month. \u201cEnding fluoridation could have real and lasting harm, especially for children and families who cannot afford regular dental care.\u201d",
      "Similar to the anti-vaccine movement, which has focused on widely debunked research associating the mumps, measles and rubella shots with autism, groups opposed to fluoride tend to seize on a study that suggests the mineral is a neurotoxin that lowers children\u2019s level of intelligence.",
      "A study published in 2019 suggested that IQ levels were slightly lower in kids whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine during pregnancy. The research was far from conclusive.",
      "Other studies looking at how fluoride affects children\u2019s brains have been called \u201clow quality\u201d by health scientists and were conducted in other countries.",
      "Another public health dentist said that faced with extensive funding cuts for any public health measures, fluoride isn\u2019t \u201cthe hill they want to die on.\u201d",
      "Dentists predict they\u2019ll see a jump in dental decay, especially among kids, in the coming years.",
      "Dr. Tom Reid, president of the Wisconsin Dental Association, said that within the next three to five years, those towns can expect to see a significant increase in rates of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening,\u201d Reid said. Dentists aren\u2019t pushing for fluoride for their own benefit, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to act in what is the best for the health of our patients, for the health of our communities.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s what happened in the Canadian city of Calgary, for example, after leaders there voted to remove fluoride from public water in 2011. A decade later, they voted to reinstate community water fluoridation amid a significant rise in cavities among kids.",
      "In Seminole County, Florida, which voted earlier this month to get fluoride out of the water system, utilities director Johnny Edwards said during the meeting that it would save the county at least $100,000.",
      "When asked whether the county would set aside that money to treat a potential increase in cavities, Chris Patton, a spokesman for the county, chuckled. No, he said, it will simply be reabsorbed into the county\u2019s utilities department."

    "published": "Sat, 26 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Members of both parties have criticized the Republican candidate for challenging certain voting laws after the election had been held.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly six months after the North Carolina Supreme Court election took place, the contest still hasn\u2019t been called and a winner still hasn\u2019t been certified.",
      "That\u2019s almost entirely due to a barrage of litigation from Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin, who sued for more than 65,000 ballots to be thrown out after they had been cast, triggering a sprawling legal saga that is testing some of the most solid precedents of election law. The effort, if successful, could be more than enough to swing the results of the election, as Griffin currently trails Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs by roughly 700 votes.",
      "But even if the push ultimately falls short, Griffin\u2019s critics, who include members of both parties, say it could have long-lasting consequences and pave the way for more candidates to pursue challenges \u2014 no matter how legally questionable \u2014 to the results of elections decided by narrow margins.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly an attempt to manipulate the law and the courts into changing an election result by changing the rules after the election has been held,\u201d said Ann Webb, a policy director with the North Carolina chapter of Common Cause, a government watchdog group.",
      "Griffin\u2019s arguments, Webb said, \u201crequire the courts to say, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s OK to ask us to change the rules after the election is done.\u2019 And that is where we really see something different and something scary, because there is nothing stopping other candidates from any party in the future from using that same strategy and pointing back to this case.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Riggs called Griffin\u2019s legal approach \u201cinsidious\u201d and warned that it would likely be mimicked if it is successful.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a North Carolina problem today, but it\u2019s a Michigan and Arizona and Georgia problem tomorrow,\u201d she said, referencing other closely divided battleground states.",
      "Even some North Carolina Republicans have called for Griffin to throw in the towel.",
      "\u201cI wanted the Republican judge to win because his philosophy more aligns with me,\u201d former GOP Gov. Pat McCrory told local news outlet ABC11 this week. \u201cHe was defeated.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou abide by the rules before the election. It\u2019s like changing a penalty call after the Super Bowl is over. You don\u2019t do that,\u201d McCrory said, adding that voters \u201cvoted based upon the rule set.\u201d",
      "In addition, Republican-led groups are running ads in the state calling for Griffin to end his litigation.",
      "A spokesperson for Griffin didn\u2019t respond to questions from NBC News for this story.",
      "In an email, North Carolina GOP spokesperson Matt Mercer accused Democrats\u00a0of not being able to \u201cmake an argument on the merits of Judge Griffin\u2019s case because they know following the law is not controversial.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf Democrats were being truthful, they\u2019d simply admit they don\u2019t actually care about honest elections and are only interested in partisan outcomes,\u201d Mercer added. The North Carolina GOP partnered with Griffin in his original litigation in the state court system.",
      "Months of litigation",
      "Riggs, who was appointed to the state Supreme Court in 2023, emerged after Election Day last November narrowly ahead of Griffin, a state appeals court judge. A full machine recount as well as a partial hand recount of the race both showed Riggs leading Griffin by 734 votes out of 5.5 million ballots cast.",
      "Griffin subsequently filed legal challenges,\u00a0backed by the North Carolina GOP, across the state, alleging that more than 65,000 people had voted illegally. The claims focused on three categories of voters: voters who Griffin\u2019s lawyers claimed didn\u2019t have driver\u2019s licenses or Social Security numbers on file in their voter registration records; overseas voters who haven\u2019t lived in North Carolina; and overseas voters who failed to provide photo identification with their ballots.",
      "A series of nuanced and complex court rulings have since followed from North Carolina state courts \u2014 including the Supreme Court, the bench that the winner of this election will join \u2014 and federal courts. (Griffin and Riggs have recused themselves from the matter when the issue came before the courts they serve on.)",
      "The latest development came Tuesday, when a federal appeals court temporarily blocked North Carolina election officials from moving forward with a period that would allow thousands of military and overseas voters to \u201ccure\u201d their ballots after that had been ordered by the North Carolina Supreme Court.",
      "In that decision earlier this month, the state Supreme Court ruled that about 60,000 of the votes in question cannot be thrown out, but that others could be if minor errors were not fixed, meaning those voters would be required to prove their eligibility to election officials.",
      "Long-term ramifications",
      "Critics of Griffin\u2019s strategy say his arguments contradict several long-held precedents in election law \u2014 and regardless of whether they\u2019re successful, they could be used in future attempts to overturn close races.",
      "One such precedent is the notion that the rules of an election must be set before voting occurs, as Griffin is seeking to throw out thousands of ballots cast by voters who followed the letter of the law.",
      "Griffin\u2019s critics also note that only he is seeking to have the ballots thrown out, not any of the other Republican candidates who competed in statewide elections in November.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are choosing to challenge voters who did nothing wrong,\u201d North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton said on a recent call with reporters. \u201cIf they truly believe that there\u2019s been election malpractice, then why is every Republican not challenging the same election results that Jefferson Griffin is right now?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, more than 200 judges, government officials, attorneys and legal professors \u2014 including some Republicans \u2014 signed a letter to Griffin last month stating, \u201cThe arguments you have advanced ask our judicial system to change the rules in place for the 2024 election after it has run its course.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you succeed, tens of thousands of voters will lose their voice after they voted,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFor the sake of our judicial system, we ask you to terminate your litigation now.\u201d",
      "In one of the latest filings from Griffin\u2019s legal team in federal court, his attorneys rejected the argument that he wanted to change \u201cthe election rules after the election.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not what the courts said. They held that the \u2018plain language\u2019 of the state constitution barred voters who had never resided in North Carolina from voting in state elections,\u201d Griffin\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cAnd the North Carolina Supreme Court found that the state election code required overseas voters to provide photo identification with their ballots. As part of its remedy, the court provided a 30-day cure period for those voters to fix the defect.\u201d",
      "Griffin\u2019s critics acknowledge the value of legal remedies following an election, but argue that he should have challenged the rules long before the election if he was concerned about them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have an escape valve in the form of post-election [legal] challenges \u2014 if there are real mistakes, or if the law has been misapplied, or there is evidence of fraud,\u201d said Webb, of Common Cause.",
      "But in this case, she said, Republicans are \u201cusing the escape valve to bring a challenge against parts of the law that were there and available to be challenged any time over the past several years.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The merch is out and available for a price on the Trump Organization website: $50 for a \u201cTrump 2028\u201d hat; $36 for a shirt that reads, \u201cTrump 2028 (Re-write the Rules).\u201d",
      "The rules aren\u2019t so easily undone. Donald Trump can\u2019t be elected again in 2028 under the constitutional amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Any number of Trump\u2019s Republican allies will tell you that a third term is inconceivable given the enormous hurdles required to pass a new amendment.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to run for another term,\u201d former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NBC News. But, he added, Trump has reason to talk about it: \"Don\u2019t underestimate the degree to which he believes any Trump-centered noise is good, because it starves his opponents.\"",
      "Yet Trump continues to flirt with the prospect of serving until 2033, when he would be 86 years old. Whether he\u2019ll follow through or not, his assertion that a third term is no joke is something that would-be-contenders ignore at their own peril.",
      "Teasing a third term freezes the 2028 GOP presidential field until aspiring candidates have a clearer understanding of whether and how far Trump intends to push the limits of the Constitution.",
      "Anyone who front runs Trump and mounts a campaign before he declares his intentions might offend the MAGA movement.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 none are likely to start building a campaign unless and until Trump concedes this term is his last.",
      "Doing so would invite \u201ctotal and complete rejection,\u201d said Steve Bannon, a senior White House official in Trump\u2019s first term who is exploring ways for Trump to serve a third term. \u201cTrump is MAGA; MAGA is Trump.\u201d",
      "Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, said that Trump\u2019s third-term musings \u201cparticularly impact JD Vance and Ron DeSantis and anyone else who wants the favor of Donald Trump. They know they have to stay out of the mix until Donald Trump gives the blessing to go after it and says that he would not be seeking a third term.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not likely to happen any time soon. The party expects Trump to draw out an announcement about his future as long as he can, according to a Republican who is close to possible 2028 candidates. The more Trump delays, the more he commands attention and averts the perception that he\u2019s a lame duck.",
      "The White House has considerable leverage at this point. No serious GOP presidential hopeful would want Trump's ire.",
      "Consider the case of DeSantis. Trump endorsed him in the 2018 Florida gubernatorial primary and viewed his subsequent 2024 presidential primary challenge as a betrayal.",
      "On top of that, Trump\u2019s political base began to distrust DeSantis after he jumped in the race against Trump, a sentiment that hasn\u2019t subsided. Before the GOP Iowa caucus last year, Laura Loomer, one of Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters, told DeSantis in the lobby of a hotel: \u201cYou killed your political career, and I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d",
      "The best way for putative candidates to stay on the right side of Trump is by going along with the notion that he might indeed run, a Trump political adviser said.",
      "\u201cI think anyone looking to 2028 is probably the first person to purchase one,\" said the adviser, referring to the \"Trump 2028\" hat, who was granted anonymity to share internal thinking.",
      "Vance may be better positioned than most rivals as Trump floats the idea of a third term. He has a built-in platform as a sitting vice president, complete with the perks that the job brings.",
      "At his disposal is a taxpayer-funded staff and airplane that he can use to build his foreign policy bona fides. It helps that his boss is a bit of a homebody and has eschewed extensive travel. This month, Vance met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome to discuss tariffs. He had an audience with Pope Francis shortly before the pontiff's death.",
      "With Trump controlling the Republican National Committee, Vance last month became the group\u2019s finance chairman, allowing him to befriend well-heeled donors who can be helpful to a future campaign.",
      "Vance has made no movements toward his own presidential run and has yet to seriously think about the idea, a source close to the vice president said.",
      "When asked if he views himself as Trump\u2019s successor, Vance insisted last month that his own White House bid was not an urgent priority but acknowledged the circumstances under which he\u2019d become a strong candidate. He also suggested that any serious moves would come after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cIf I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cNow, like, yeah, in two and a half years, will that become harder? Will people be more focused on politics than on what the White House is maybe doing that particular day? Maybe.\u201d",
      "Others can\u2019t be as confident. DeSantis faces term limitations and will be out of office in 2027, so he won\u2019t have the stage that the Florida governor\u2019s office provides. Still, that might not dampen his ambitions.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely believes he can still be president. While most on the outside looking in do not think he has viability, that\u2019s just not how he thinks. It\u2019s not how he views the world,\u201d a longtime DeSantis ally said.",
      "If Trump finds a way to run, though, his grip on the GOP is such that  serious opposition may well evaporate.",
      "The most direct way for Trump to circumvent the 22nd amendment is to change it. But that\u2019s nearly an insurmountable obstacle in these polarized times, requiring three-quarters of the states to go along, for starters.",
      "More fanciful ideas for overcoming the legal barrier involves a scenario in which Vance runs for president and picks Trump as his running mate. If they win, Vance then steps aside and Trump becomes president again.",
      "Were Vance to go along with that, attention might turn from the 22nd Amendment to the 12th. That amendment states that no one who is ineligible under the Constitution to be president shall be eligible to serve as vice president.",
      "So, the question then becomes, is Trump ineligible to be Vance\u2019s running mate given that he\u2019s barred under the 22nd Amendment from being elected to a third term? And, here, the answer may come down to a careful textual reading of the two amendments at issue.",
      "An argument might be made that because the 22nd Amendment says only that Trump can\u2019t be elected president a third time, that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be president if Vance were to resign and turn the job over to him.",
      "Such a scenario, \u201cis contrary to the intent of the amendments,\u201d but is not \u201csquarely foreclosed by the words,\u201d said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School (and the great, great grandson of former President Theodore Roosevelt).",
      "Whether Vance would go along is a mystery. He has not publicly discussed the possibility, and spokespeople and advisers have declined requests to elaborate on what Vance is thinking about such a  2028 calculus.",
      "In an interview with Trump on April 22, Time magazine asked his thoughts about a swap with his number two.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing a good job.\u201d",
      "While \u201cthere are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in loopholes. I don\u2019t believe in using loopholes.\u201d",
      "Keeping the nation guessing, it turns out, is paying off. On Thursday, none other than the president\u2019s second-oldest son, Eric Trump, posed for a picture on X, smiling and sporting a \u201cTrump 2028\u201d hat."

    "summary": "Democrats are increasingly saying that simply unwinding Trump's policies isn't enough. But there are still broad disagreements on policy and the next leader.",
    "story": [
      "Kamala Harris\u2019 rallying cry to supporters in the 2024 election was simple and straightforward: \u201cWe are not going back.\u201d",
      "After voters decided to return President Donald Trump to the White House, Democrats are increasingly acknowledging their path forward can\u2019t simply be a promise to unwind whatever policies Trump puts in place. Society needs to fundamentally change. They just don\u2019t agree on exactly how.",
      "That conversation\u00a0is happening amid a backdrop of the Democratic Party\u2019s popularity reaching an all-time low dating back to 1990, per an NBC News survey last month. Party leaders from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have all staked out different approaches to dealing with Trump and attempting to chart a path forward. And Democrats are seeking ways to reach new audiences.",
      "Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist working with a handful of potential 2028 contenders, said he still feels it will \u201ctake a lot of coaching for Democrats to understand we cannot go back to the old system.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat system was broken,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work for most Americans \u2014 and we were the ones defending it. People weren\u2019t asking for a return to normal. They wanted change.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd sure, Trump made it worse,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s created chaos, jacked up prices, lined his own pockets while everyone else struggles. But here\u2019s the real danger: when we get back in power, the instinct will be to rebuild the old system. Rebuild USAID. Rebuild the broken institutions. Wrong move. If we do that, we\u2019re going to give Republicans a massive opening in 2032 to elect someone way worse than Trump. If we play our cards right, we\u2019ve got a rare shot \u2014 maybe a once-in-a-generation shot \u2014 to build something better.\u201d",
      "Nellis is far from alone in sounding that alarm. In an episode of the \u201cFlagrant\u201d podcast released this week, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, called for Democrats to \u201crevisit \u2026 what it is we\u2019re offering, because ... it sounds like what we\u2019re offering is just \u2018Let\u2019s go back.\u2019\u201d",
      "His response echoed what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., who was Harris\u2019 running mate in 2024, told reporters at a Democratic Governors Association press briefing in March.",
      "\u201cThis is not like running the car out of gas, and you can put gas back in it and it will take off again; this is like running the car out of oil,\u201d Walz said, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s plans to gut parts of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cI see the opportunity in this,\u201d added Walz, who, like Buttigieg, is viewed as a potential 2028 candidate. Trump \u201cwill continue to break these things, but when we rebuild, we can reimagine what those look like and make them better.\u201d",
      "'Trust in institutions is gone for a lot of people'",
      "Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat who is running in a contested primary to succeed Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., is among a younger cohort of Democratic officials pushing for generational change in the party\u2019s leadership. She has said she believes it\u2019s time for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to pass the torch, too.",
      "An NBC News/Stay Tuned poll released Thursday found that 77% of Americans either strongly or somewhat believe that \u201cnothing will change\u201d in the U.S. until a \u201cnew generation of leaders\u201d is elected.",
      "McMorrow, 38, recalled graduating from Notre Dame amid the Great Recession and feeling dejected by the existing order when she was unable to land a solid job. She said voters now are experiencing the same disenchantment, and Democrats need to answer for it.",
      "\u201cWhen I talk to people all across the state, people just don\u2019t believe that success is possible for them anymore,\u201d she said.",
      "\"hat we are laying out is that in the rubble that will be left behind by Donald Trump \u2014 who is now, between him and Elon Musk, taking a chainsaw to the government \u2014 that there will be an opportunity to build something new and acknowledge that trust in institutions is gone for a lot of people,\" she added.",
      "McMorrow boils down her platform to \u201csuccess, safety and sanity,\u201d focusing on affordability of housing and cost-of-living, safe neighborhoods and immigration reform, among other points. But she said Democrats can\u2019t just be focused on passing legislation. Instead, they must work to ensure the programs they pass actually work as intended.",
      "She mentioned currently reading \u201cAbundance,\u201d the new book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson that examines why the U.S. has struggled to advance ambitious projects.",
      "\u201cIt should embarrass all of us that we are not building high-speed rail, we\u2019re not finishing these housing projects,\u201d she said, adding that Democrats must \u201cactually deliver on the things that we believe in without putting so many hurdles and disconnected systems in place.\u201d",
      "So far, specifics for a Democratic future are light \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of disagreement. High-profile internal tensions erupted this past week after activist and Democratic National Committee vice chair David Hogg announced his outside political action committee would spend $20 million on primaries, in part to target \u201cineffective\u201d Democratic incumbents.",
      "At 25, Hogg is advocating for the party to shift its recruiting strategy to bring younger candidates into solid blue districts and oust largely older candidates. The plan prompted a rebuke from the DNC chair, who said officers should remain neutral.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do here is make sure that we\u2019re holding ourselves accountable and letting people know that if there\u2019s somebody who\u2019s failing to meet the moment in this moment of crisis that our country is in,\u201d then there will be efforts to supplant them, Hogg said in an interview.",
      "In his vision, in addition to changing the messengers, the party would center its efforts in finding paths where those of any age could still feel as if they can pursue the American dream, with lower costs for health care, elder care, child care, education and housing. He also noted fighting corruption and enhancing public safety while combating gun violence. Both McMorrow and Nellis highlighted many of the same issue areas Hogg did.",
      "'The moment is here to build what comes next'",
      "On Thursday, the DNC announced it was changing its strategy and ramping up investments in every state party, including giving extra funds to Democratic parties in red states. It\u2019s a shift from the longtime focus on swing states.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m done with Democrats myopically focusing on just a few battleground states every few years, we are not simply a presidential campaign committee,\u201d DNC Chair Ken Martin said on Thursday. \u201cThe DNC is now the primary hub for building out a permanent political organizing movement across every part of the country. I\u2019ve always said there\u2019s no such thing as a perpetual red state or a perpetual blue state. And my job is to prove that to be true.\u201d",
      "And while many in the party talk about the opportunity to build new systems and structures if Democrats take back presidential and congressional power after Trump, the broad disagreements that have plagued the party for years still abound.",
      "As the Trump administration has moved to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs from the federal government and U.S. institutions, some, like Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, have blasted the move, while others like Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., have grown more vocal in opposition to certain DEI programs.",
      "Even whether the party should focus on finding common ground on policy or finding a common leader is dividing Democrats.",
      "In a recent interview, Newsom dismissed concerns about whether Democrats could unite around one candidate in 2028, telling NBC News, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about [whether] we will find a great candidate. But what do we stand for? What are we about? What are we going to fight for?\u201d",
      "But at a Nevada rally in March, Ocasio-Cortez called on the rank-and-file in her party to \u201cchoose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\u201d",
      "One argument still haunting the party is about whether it needs to shift away from campaigning on moral and social issues in favor of sticking to an economic message.",
      "Newsom, on an episode of his podcast \u2014 a platform where he has hosted Trump-allied activists Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon and drawn Democratic criticism \u2014\u00a0said he believed former President Joe Biden had \u201cfrustration\u201d with this in 2024, telling the former U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, \u201cHe was talking about an economic message, he was talking about his worker-centered industrial policy, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily breaking through because \u2026 of the bathroom debates, the pronoun debates and all these other debates.\u201d",
      "Similarly, Buttigieg told the \u201cFlagrant\u201d hosts Democrats must \u201cdo a much better job, especially with the finger-wagging that you\u2019re talking about \u2026 You get the sense of moral conviction, and you\u2019re so sure of it, that you start to think it makes it OK to be an a--hole.\u201d",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., is going further, urging the party to change the public\u2019s \u201cweak and woke\u201d perception of it and \u201cf---ing retake the flag\u201d with patriotic appeals, as Politico reported.",
      "But Walz, during a town hall in Texas, said in 2024, advocated a different approach, saying it was a mistake that Democrats let Republicans define issues like DEI and the term \"woke.\"",
      "Democrats, he said, \u201cweren\u2019t bold enough to stand up and say: \u2018You\u2019re damn right we\u2019re proud of these policies.\u2019\u201d",
      "The party\u2019s progressive wing, meanwhile, sees new opportunities here, too, especially at a time when Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are touring the country and drawing huge crowds at their \u201cFight Oligarchy\u201d-branded rallies.",
      "\u201cWe are entering moments that we have never experienced before,\u201d Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., told constituents at a town hall in Pittsburgh last week. \u201cThe country as we know it may never exist the way that it had. And the reality is that the way that the country had existed was never its best form anyway.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe moment is here to build what comes next. My argument is that we should be fighting harder than they are to be the author of what is next,\u201d she said of progressives. \u201cBecause if we are not the ones who build it, then they are building it, but it\u2019s getting built one way or another.\u201d",
      "Emilia Rowland, a progressive strategist, said Democrats need to better deal with the consequences of rapid tech advancement that is continuing to reshape society and further concentrate power as the government and other institutions struggle to keep up. She added that Democrats need to rethink how they communicate, too.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing that I\u2019ve been really thinking about is the risk calculation between what\u2019s the risk of doing something versus the risk of not doing anything or not showing that we\u2019re fighting for something,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to protect status quo institutions when they\u2019re not serving them. Right now, people are mad at the institutions because of Trump. That\u2019s not going to change when Trump\u2019s out.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., on Friday signaled support for impeaching President Donald Trump, telling attendees at a town hall near Atlanta that the president\u2019s conduct \u201chas already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.\u201d",
      "\u201cI mean, I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cWhen the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him. There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday night.",
      "Video of the town hall was made available online by NBC affiliate WXIA. Ossoff, who is currently running for re-election to the U.S. Senate, made the remark in response to an attendee who asked why Democrats have not moved to impeach Trump, stating her belief that \u201ceverything that Trump is doing is leading us down an authoritative rule.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo more. I like you and I will vote for you if you are brave, and you do what we need,\u201d the attendee said. \u201cWe need him impeached, we need him removed.\u201d",
      "Ossoff in response said he \u201cstrongly\u201d agreed with the attendee, but told the audience that the move is not currently feasible given the current makeup of the House of Representatives, which is responsible for introducing articles of impeachment.",
      "\u201cThe only way to achieve what you want to achieve is to have a majority United States House of Representatives,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cAnd believe me, I\u2019m working on it every single day, every single day.\u201d",
      "The Georgia senator also pointed to what he characterized as Trump\u2019s defiance of a federal court order as another potentially impeachable offense. Ossoff did not specify exactly which case he was referring to, but the remark comes as Democrats accuse Trump of disregarding a Supreme Court order requiring his administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native and Maryland resident deported to El Salvador.",
      "The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, called Ossoff\u2019s remarks \u201cdisgusting,\u201d accusing him of attempting to \u201coverturn the will of Georgia voters who just elected President Trump.\u201d",
      "Ossoff now joins a handful of congressional Democrats who have backed calls to impeach Trump in his second term.",
      "Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who called for Trump\u2019s impeachment several times during his first term and was removed from Trump\u2019s  joint address to Congress in March, was the first Democrat this cycle to back the idea.",
      "Additionally, Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., said earlier this month he \u201cfully supports impeaching\u201d Trump, accusing the president of \u201cnot abiding by a lawful Supreme Court ruling.\u201d",
      "Trump was impeached twice as a result of actions during his first term, but was acquitted by the Senate following each trial. Ossoff joined all Democrats in voting guilty in Trump\u2019s second impeachment. He was not in Congress during Trump\u2019s first trial.",
      "Impeaching Trump again and convicting would require the support of a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate. Because Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress, the effort is a nonstarter, at least until the midterm election cycle.",
      "But still, the support among Democratic voters for impeachment reflects broader calls for the party to more actively and aggressively counter Trump\u2019s agenda, a notion that polling suggests is widespread among the party\u2019s base.",
      "A recent NBC News poll found less than a third of Democrats want their party leaders to make legislative compromises with Trump, while nearly two-thirds would rather congressional Democrats stick to their positions even if that risks sacrificing bipartisan progress."

      "The Northern Irish hip-hop group Kneecap responded on Friday to criticism over their pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel messaging during their Coachella set earlier this month, calling the backlash a \u201ccoordinated smear campaign.\u201d",
      "The group, which has been vocal about its view of the conflict in Gaza, performed their set during the festival in front of a screen featuring the words \u201cF--- Israel, Free Palestine.\u201d",
      "The group claimed in a post on X after the festival\u2019s first weekend that organizers subsequently censored the livestream of their performance. \u00a0While it was not broadcast online, images of the onstage message circulated across social media, prompting outrage\u00a0online.",
      "Tribe of Nova, the organizers behind Israel\u2019s Nova Music Festival where Hamas launched a deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that left 1,200 people dead, said Kneecap\u2019s messaging \u201cdeeply hurt many in our community.\u201d The organization invited band members to \u201cvisit the Nova Exhibition and experience firsthand the stories of those who were murdered, those who survived, and those who are still being held hostage.\u201d",
      "Kneecap said in an X post Friday: \u201cThose attacking us want to silence criticism of a mass slaughter. They weaponize false accusations of antisemitism to distract, confuse, and provide cover for genocide.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe do not give a f*ck what religion anyone practices,\u201d the group continued. \u201cWe know there are massive numbers of Jewish people outraged by this genocide just as we are. What we care about is that governments of the countries we perform in are enabling some of the most horrific crimes of our lifetimes \u2014 and we will not stay silent.\u201d",
      "The group\u2019s statement comes one week after Coachella wrapped, and amid calls from some critics for the band to be reprimanded by U.S. officials.",
      "Among the more vocal critics was Sharon Osbourne, a TV personality and the wife of heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne, who accused Kneecap of hate speech and said the U.S. should revoke the group\u2019s work visas.",
      "\u201cWhile festivals like Coachella showcase remarkable talent from around the globe, music\u2019s primary purpose is to unite people,\u201d Osbourne, who said she\u2019s of Irish Catholic and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, wrote in a lengthy post on X on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cIt should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organizations or spreading hate.\u201d",
      "She said while she respects artists\u2019 \u201cright to exercise their opinions,\u201d Kneecap \u201ctook their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements.\u201d",
      "According to the BBC, during the band\u2019s second weekend performance, the band led a crowd in a \u201cfree Palestine\u201d chant, and band member Mo Chara touched on the conflict.",
      "\u201cThe Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go,\u201d Chara said to the audience. \u201cThe Palestinians have nowhere to go.\u201d",
      "More than\u00a050,000\u00a0people have been killed in Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Osbourne said Goldenvoice, the organizers behind the Indio, California,-based festival, should not have allowed them to perform again after seeing their first weekend performance.",
      "\u201cThis behavior raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\u201d she added, calling on people to join her in \u201cadvocating for the revocation of Kneecap\u2019s work visa.\u201d",
      "Goldenvoice did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday."

      "Lenore Dove loves to sing but has a penchant for trouble as her rebellious tendencies often get the better of her. At the start of the novel, to mark Haymitch's 16th birthday, she gifts him a gold flint striker, which becomes the token he brings into the Games.",
      "Before being cast, Peak, 22, appeared in several shows and movies. She's best known for playing Stella in \"Molly's Game\" and Judith in \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\" She was also in the \"Gossip Girl\" reboot and \"Hocus Pocus 2.\"",

      "The baby creature from \u201cThe Legend of Ochi\u201d has captured the internet\u2019s heart \u2014 just as its creators intended.",
      "Director Isaiah Saxon tells TODAY.com about how his ideas came to life for the ochi, the name of the wild beasts who live in the forests surrounding a remote village on the fictional island of Carpathia, where the family-friendly movie is set.",
      "\u201cThe goal with designing the ochi was to create a realistic-feeling undiscovered primate species, so that a kid watching the film could wonder, \u2018Have I just not seen the BBC nature special yet on this animal?\u2019 Like, this feels like a real animal,\u201d Saxon says.",
      "\"The Legend of Ochi,\" out April 25, stars Helena Zengel alongside Finn Wolfhard, best known from his role as Mike Wheeler on \u201cStranger Things.\u201d When Zengel\u2019s character Yuri discovers a baby ochi who has been left behind, she\u2019s determined to do whatever it takes to get the adorable creature back to its pack.",
      "The pair go on an adventure through woodlands, waters and even a grocery store, where the baby ochi quickly melts the hearts of the characters and viewers alike.",
      "Filmed in the Carpathian mountains of Romania, the film takes fantastical elements from its location \u2014 but the magic of the baby ochi is that it is a puppet, Wolfhard tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see the ochi actually in action until I was on set, and the puppeteers showed me. Basically, they said, \u2018Do you want to meet him?\u2019 And I just looked at the puppet, and it looked up at me and blinked and had head movements,\u201d Wolfhard said. \u201cIt was like a truly real creature.\u201d",
      "There are complicated mechanics behind bringing the ochi to life, Wolfhard says, but it all comes together to make the ochi appear like a real-life animal.",
      "\u201cThe ochi had a whole team of people, and all the puppeteers are actors because they are all trying to get a very specific performance out of the ochi,\u201d Wolfhard says. \u201cIt was six people piloting one creature, as opposed to just one actor, but they were such amazing performers. That\u2019s why I like working with practical effects \u2014 it\u2019s so fun because you have that human connection with it.\u201d",
      "Saxon says inspiration for the gremlins came in part from his longtime obsession with Chinese golden snub-nosed monkeys. He also took elements from lemurs, tarsiers and other primates for the look of the ochi, while borrowing from birdsong and the noises dolphins make for the language the animals use in the film.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t looking to movie creatures or mythical creatures. It was looking to nature,\u201d he says. \u201cI really wanted to pull from the wide variety of superpowers that you do find in nature, and real patterns in zoology, and put them into one fictional animal.\u201d",
      "The cuteness factor for the baby ochi was important from the start, Saxon says. After drafting up several drawings of what the ochi would look like for the film, Saxon says he reached out to John Nolan Studios in London to create animatronics for the creatures.",
      "\u201cThey made a prototype that was completely furless and had no facial movement, but immediately, the five puppeteers brought it to life, it was just completely convincing that this was a real being,\u201d Saxon recalls. \u201cIt was absolutely adorable from the break.\u201d",
      "Saxon says designing the baby ochi as a puppet adds characteristics that play into how lovable the creature becomes throughout the film.",
      "\u201cA lot of the little imperfections that you might see in a baby primate trying to move learn how to move their own body, those are the types of little things that come through in rod puppeteering,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it had that vulnerability from the beginning, from the puppetry.\u201d",
      "Once the crew was on set filming in Romania, \u201cthere was a tremendous amount of effort in just like, policing his cuteness,\u201d Saxon says of the baby ochi.",
      "He joked about a \u201clast-minute rhinoplasty\u201d to make the baby\u2019s nose cuter after realizing it wasn\u2019t quite right, and other situations on set to ensure the creature had the look he was going for.",
      "The film, which launched in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles on April 17, is headed to theaters nationwide on April 25. But the hype for the charm of the baby ochi is only just beginning, as viewers start to react to the gremlin on social media.",
      "\"I just watched THE LEGEND OF OCHI and I want everyone to know that I would die for this little guy,\" one user posted on X.",
      "\"I completely adored THE LEGEND OF OCHI. It pulls inspiration from Amblin movies like E.T., Jim Henson\u2019s classics, and even Ghibli, but still takes tons of *weird* swings that create its own identity full of wonder,\" another X user wrote. \"They literally don\u2019t make family adventures like this anymore.\"",
      "\"Just like 'E.T.' was for so many of my generation I hope there\u2019s a kid out there whose new favorite movie is THE LEGEND OF OCHI and it inspires them to become a filmmaker,\" another X user posted. \"Lovely movie.\"",
      "Another X user said: \"The Legend of Ochi is a wholesome fantasy adventure. It has really beautiful puppetry and practical effects that really make the Ochi come to life. You love every second baby Ochi is on screen. The world feels very beautiful and unique.\"",

      "Who is Marienne?",
      "Marienne Bellamy was introduced as a local librarian in Madre Linda, the fictional California town in Season 3.",
      "An aspiring artist, Joe found her to be strict and austere. However, over time, the pair struck up a friendly banter, which eventually transformed into flirting.",
      "She has a daughter, Juliette (Dallas Skye), although Marienne's ex-husband, Ryan Goodwin (Scott Michael Foster), had full custody of her.",
      "Their marriage had difficulties. Ryan was abusive and both were struggling with addiction when they had Juliette. Despite Marienne getting clean, Ryan was able to lie and use Marienne's past to manipulate the justice system into getting full custody.",
      "Marienne speaks fluent French as she was born in Paris and bounced around from foster home to foster home before she turned 18. Her biggest driving force in life is her daughter.",
      "What happened between Marienne and Joe in Season 3?",
      "Joe, hating Madre Linda, was drawn to the library that Marienne worked at. He began volunteering there, repairing the library's rare books.",
      "Eventually, Marienne became Joe's newest fixation. At the time, Joe was married to Love (Victoria Pedretti). Yet as is his pattern, Joe still became fixated on new women in his life, needing to stalk them. Once Love killed Natalie (Michaela McManus), Joe's initial love interest, Marienne became his prime fixation.",
      "As the two continued working together (and Joe stalking her), they got closer and eventually kissed.",
      "Realizing that Love would kill Marienne for their kiss, Joe planned to resign from the library. Before he could, Marienne admitted that she had feelings for Joe but would never break up his family. The two kissed again. Not long after, Marienne ended things as their secret affair was hurting her custody battle.",
      "The judge ended up ruling against Marienne in her custody battle, which meant Ryan was in the clear to take Juliette and move to New Jersey. Joe told Marienne that he was ending his marriage for her and the two became more intimate.",
      "But there wasn't a future. Marienne planned to follow Juliette and Ryan to New Jersey for her daughter's sake. Joe then killed Ryan so Marienne wouldn't leave.",
      "Joe told Marienne that he was officially separating from Love (despite Love not knowing anything of the sort) and the two told each other they loved each other, forming plans to run away together.",
      "At dinner that night, Love paralyzed Joe and invited Marienne over through Joe's phone. Love said they weren't separating and that Joe lied to her. Then, Love revealed that Joe killed Ryan because he was obsessed with Marienne.",
      "Love prepared to kill Marienne, but Juliette interrupted, causing the impulsive Love to pause. When she realized she couldn't kill either of them, she instead advised Marienne to run far away from Joe.",
      "Marienne told Love that she should run too, but Love couldn't \u2014 instead dying at Joe's hands that same night. Joe then faked his own death, posing the scene as if Love committed a murder-suicide.",
      "What happened to Marienne in Season 4?",
      "In Season 4, Joe once again relocated, this time to London. He continued to miss Marienne, who took Love's advice and ran.",
      "The show flashed back to Joe following Marienne to an art fair in London. When she saw him there, she ran away from him. Joe chased her and cornered her. Marienne told Joe that she didn't love him anymore and realized that if he's alive, he must have killed Love and faked his death. She called him a murderer and Joe vowed to prove her wrong. He let her go, telling her \"goodbye,\" to prove that he would never hurt her.",
      "Most of the season passes without seeing Marienne \u2014 although she is always on the forefront of Joe's mind.",
      "Then comes Episode 8's twist: Joe had been dissociating all season. He had actually followed Marienne after the art fair, drugged her and kidnapped her so the pair could \"work on their relationship.\"",
      "In his disassociated state, Joe put Marienne inside his cage. While transferring her from a tied chair to the cage, she tried to escape, breaking her arm in the process. Joe gave her pain medicine, but as a former addict she refused to take it. Time went by as Marienne begged for her life for Juliette's sake, but a disassociated Joe was still unaware he'd even kidnapped her.",
      "Once Joe realized that he'd kidnapped Marienne, he tried to remember where the cage was. As he tried to remember, Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman) found Marienne locked in the cage and offered to call the police. But Marienne told her not to, as Joe would just get away with it like he always has.",
      "Nadia returned the next day to help, but Joe had finally found the cage. He apologized to Marienne, telling her he never wanted this to happen and promised to fix it. Once Joe left, Nadia proposed killing Joe. Marienne said that she would kill him. Nadia said she could get ketamine and a knife for Marienne. In the process of procuring the items, Nadia was stopped by police.",
      "Meanwhile, Marienne asked Joe to check her phone to see how Juliette is doing. There Joe texted Beatrice \u2014 Marienne's friend watching Juliette \u2014 and learned that Marienne was losing custody of Juliette as Juliette's grandmother believed Marienne had left Juliette and relapsed. The news crushed Marienne and she begged for Joe to kill her, although he couldn't.",
      "So, Marienne swallowed the entire bottle of pain medicine she'd been resisting \u2014 killing herself. She left a note asking Joe to \"please leave me where I'll be found\" so Juliette knows what happened.",
      "In the finale, Joe left Marienne's dead body on a park bench.",
      "But \"You\" has one final twist: Nadia had given Marienne a backup plan.",
      "Nadia added her number under Beatrice's contact in Marienne's phone, faking messages that made her seem like a concerned babysitter. Nadia texted as Beatrice that Juliette's grandmother was taking custody (although this was false). This gave Marienne a reason to kill herself. Nadia also switched out the painkillers for beta blockers, allowing Marienne to pretend to overdose on the painkillers when she really just took beta blockers that slowed her heart.",
      "Nadia then followed Joe as he left Marienne's body on a bench. After he left, she injected Marienne with something that woke her up, freeing her from being hunted by Joe across the world."

    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 2 of \u201cThe Last of Us.\u201d",
      "\"The Last of Us\" star Kaitlyn Dever was coping with the loss of her mother when she had to film Season 2's most shocking scene yet \u2014 when her character Abby kills Joel, the beloved character portrayed by Pedro Pascal.",
      "Dever opened up in an interview with Entertainment Weekly about her experience shooting Episode 2 just weeks after her mother, Kathy, died due to complications from breast cancer in 2024.",
      "\u201cTo be as honest as possible,\u201d she said, \u201cI will just say that my days leading up to this scene were horrible.\u201d",
      "\u201cI lost my mom two or three weeks before I actually shot this scene,\u201d she added, \u201cand my mom\u2019s funeral was three days before I did my first day. So I was sort of in a fog. I was in a daze.\u201d",
      "Abby killed Joel to exact revenge for him killing her own father in Season 1. Abby's father was a Firefly working to find a vaccine for the deadly Cordyceps fungus. Their plan was to use Ellie's (Bella Ramsey) brain, as she is immune \u2014 killing her in the process. Joel couldn't let that stand so he broke her out of the facility and perpetuated a massacre in the process.",
      "Craig Mazin, one of the show's creators, told Entertainment Weekly that he and the team told Dever to take all the time she needed to prepare for shooting the scene.",
      "\u201cWhile I care extraordinarily about the show, it\u2019s a TV show,\u201d Mazin said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to disrupt someone\u2019s grieving process for their own parent, especially (with) a show that\u2019s partly about the grieving process.\u201d",
      "The crew ended up reworking the shooting schedule so that Dever could pick the day she felt the most comfortable filming, and they shoot the footage in a closed set.",
      "\u201cBecause of my life circumstances, I wasn\u2019t actually able to do my normal routine as an actor, which was really interesting because I was kind of worried about it,\u201d Dever said. \u201cUsually if I have a monologue like that, I\u2019m memorizing it three weeks before I do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had a different approach, and I think that it really served the character in a lot of ways,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was able to sort of\u2026 I don\u2019t know, just really let it go and not think about it too much because the words on the page are so powerful anyway.\u201d",
      "Dever announced her mother's death on Instagram in February 2024, remembering the time she spent with her in the caption of the post.",
      "\"Nothing I\u2019ll ever say will amount to the gifts you have given me in my life, the boundless joy you brought, the deep, endless, unconditional love you gave me and our family,\" Dever wrote. \"Your love was everywhere.\"",
      "According to Entertainment Weekly, Kathy Dever had been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer at age 39, which she fought for 14 years until her death in 2024.",
      "\"Your love was like sunshine, warmed me when I needed it the most and made me smile when I was ever sad,\" Dever wrote on Instagram. \"You were everyone\u2019s favorite. You are my favorite. The sweetest in the world. I will be broken forever without you and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll go on.\""

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump called on Russia and Ukraine to hold direct ceasefire negotiations for the first time in years, urging the two sides to build on Friday\u2019s meeting between President Vladimir Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cA good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to \u2018finish it off,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \u201cWe will be wherever is necessary to help facilitate the END to this cruel and senseless war!\u201d",
      "Representatives for Russia and Ukraine did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday night on Trump\u2019s post.",
      "The two countries have not held direct talks since the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy aide to Putin, called the meeting between the Russian leader and Witkoff, who also has participated  in ceasefire talks with Ukraine, \u201cproductive.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis conversation allowed to bring positions of Russia and the United States closer together not only on Ukraine, but also on a number of other international matters,\u201d Ushakov said in a statement.",
      "\u201cI would like to note that in accordance with the agreement reached by the presidents of Russia and the United States, productive Russian-American dialogue at various levels will continue in the most active mode,\u201d he added.",
      "Witkoff did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.",
      "Putin told a Russian state TV reporter on Monday that he was open to resuming ceasefire talks with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in return said on Monday that Ukraine \u201cwas ready for any conversation\u201d that would halt strikes on civilians.",
      "Trump\u2019s call for direct negotiations came the same day he was quoted in an interview with Time saying that \u201cCrimea will stay with Russia,\u201d the latest example of the U.S. president pressuring Ukraine to concede land to Russian invaders.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy understands that,\u201d Trump said, referring to the strategic Crimean Peninsula, which Russian illegally annexed in 2014. \u201cEverybody understands that it\u2019s been with them for a long time.\u201d",
      "One of Ukraine\u2019s most prominent politicians, Kyiv mayor and former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, has conceded that his country may have to give up territory to Russia if it wants to achieve a peace deal \u2014 a major departure from the policies of his country\u2019s\u00a0president.",
      "Klitschko told the BBC on Friday morning while discussing ceasefire options that \u201cone of the scenarios is to give up territory.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d he added, \u201cbut for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary.\u201d",
      "Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser in Zelenskyy\u2019s office, told the BBC that the comments on ceding territory earlier Friday by Klitschko were \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d",
      "Klitschko and Zelenskyy are political opponents who have clashed before. But the Kyiv mayor is now one of the most prominent Ukrainian politicians to suggest that these demands could soften.",
      "The Ukrainian government has repeatedly ruled out relinquishing land to Moscow. That\u2019s left a gulf between its position and that of Russia and the Trump administration, which has been a central force in negotiations to end the war.",
      "The meeting between Putin and Witkoff on Friday came at roughly the same time Zelenskyy said in a post on X that it was \u201cclear\u201d at least one of Russia\u2019s sweeping strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday involved \u201ca ballistic missile from North Korea.\u201d",
      "If confirmed, that would suggest that Pyongyang is sending materiel \u2014 as well as thousands of troops \u2014 to Russia\u2019s western front and signal broadening support for Moscow from one of the West\u2019s most bellicose and secretive foes.",
      "In a long post Friday, Zelenskyy said that while Ukraine had agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s proposed ceasefire 45 days ago, \u201cRussia rejects all of this. That is why this cannot be resolved without pressure. Pressure on Russia is necessary.\u201d",
      "Trump, who has often been accused of being more lenient toward Russia than Ukraine, insisted to journalists Thursday that \u201cyou don\u2019t know what pressure I\u2019m putting on Russia\u201d \u2014 without elaborating. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, said the Kremlin was \u201cready to reach a deal\u201d but that some details needed to be \u201cfine-tuned.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s those details that have so far been irreconcilable between the parties.",
      "As a president who once promised he could achieve peace in 24 hours, Trump eagerly wants to land a deal, particularly as he marks his first 100 days in office next week.",
      "Trump recently conceded that his campaign promise to end the war in a single day was an \u201cexaggeration\u201d made \u201cin jest,\u201d but still maintains that he is the only person who can broker a peace deal between the two nations.",
      "\u201cIf somebody else is president, no chance,\u201d Trump said in his interview with Time.",
      "Russia is hesitant to give up what it sees as its battlefield and diplomatic advantage \u2014 including an amenable president in the White House \u2014 according to regional analysts. And Ukraine is reluctant to sign an agreement that it believes will bring both painful territorial concessions and vulnerability to future attacks by the Kremlin.",
      "Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and his forces currently control around a fifth of its territory, including Crimea. Zelenskyy reiterated his stance Thursday, saying there was \u201cnothing to talk about\u201d when it came to relinquishing territory on a more permanent basis. \u201cIt is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,\u201d he said.",
      "That stance had already prompted an angry reaction this week from Trump, who on social media Wednesday accused Zelenskyy of making \u201cinflammatory statements\u201d by refusing to cede land for peace.",
      "As well as diplomatically, Ukraine is under pressure on the front lines and in the skies, where Russia continues its nightly bombardment of civilians."

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and \u201cbreaches of order\u201d in\u00a0an\u00a0incident last month\u00a0when Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian\u00a0emergency\u00a0workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
      "In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media Sunday, the IDF said it \u201cregrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\u201d and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer.",
      "The report and the IDF\u2019s rare acceptance of blame were the culmination of a weekslong scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel\u2019s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident on March 23, and cellphone video found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d Brig. Gen.\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, said the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim the IDF also denied.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement after the bodies were found that the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff members and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed people they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video from the Palestine Red Crescent challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed video from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and the presentation, which retired Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who led the presentation, said were conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics whom the IDF considered terrorists had changed.",
      "The report and the presentation also left it unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in its custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance video.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and that they misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, whom the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary said, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

      "For Indians watching Modi\u2019s speech, it was an echo of 2019 when a convoy of Indian security forces was blown up in Kashmir and he responded by launching aerial strikes on Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, Indian nationalism is higher than ever, the Pakistan military\u2019s grip on power has weakened, and the U.S. is no longer in Afghanistan, which analysts say historically deterred violence between India and Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThat perhaps gives India a bit of a blank check to do whatever it pleases,\u201d said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "A region simmering with rage",
      "Resentment between India and Pakistan dates to 1947, when Hindu-majority India gained independence from British colonial rule and Muslim-majority Pakistan was established as a separate state in a deadly partition in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed while migrating across the newly formed border.",
      "The border lines were clearly defined and accepted except for the mountainous state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is among the most militarized places in the world. Both Pakistan and India lay full claim to it, but most of it is Indian-administered, while Pakistan controls a small chunk to the west.",
      "Tensions have escalated since Modi revoked Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomous status in 2019, effectively putting the region under direct control of the federal government in a move that was criticized by rights groups and raised fears that Kashmir\u2019s ethnic and religious identity would be diluted by Hindu settlers.",
      "Modi\u2019s government said the move ended decades of armed rebellion in the region. Elections were held last year and hailed as a sign of normalcy.",
      "\u201cOne indicator of normalcy that the government was always giving out was, look, there are so many tourists visiting,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Deependra Singh Hooda, former head of the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command, who was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2016.",
      "Praveen Donthi, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at International Crisis Group, said the attack was a \u201ccolossal intelligence failure.\u201d",
      "Modi\u2019s narrative of peace and stability \u201cled to complacency, which is why they did not see this coming,\u201d he said.",
      "'Bodies lying on the ground'",
      "Pallavi Rao and her husband, Manjunath, had taken their son to Kashmir to celebrate his near-perfect score on his high school diploma exams. They had enjoyed a boat ride on the popular Dal lake in Kashmir\u2019s main city of Srinagar before heading to Pahalgam about 30 miles away.",
      "The militants found them in the meadow.",
      "After her husband was shot in the head, Rao told reporters, she and her son asked the militants to kill them too. They refused, saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t kill you, go tell Prime Minister Modi.\u201d",
      "A local pony handler, Syed Adil Hussain Shah, was also killed while trying to save the tourists.",
      "\u201cHe used to earn 300 rupees [$3.50] in a day, our only source of income in the family,\u201d Ravisa Hussain Shah, his younger sister, told NBC News in an interview at their home in the village of Hapatnur.",
      "Among the first to reach the scene was Sajad Ahmad Bhat, 31, a shawl seller and tour guide.",
      "\u201cI saw bodies lying on the ground,\u201d he said.",
      "Bhat carried one of the victims almost 2.5 miles to safety, video of which went viral online.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the boy was. But he was crying and seeking help, his hands and sweater were soaked in blood,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the attack, India has suspended a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan and closed the only functional land border crossing. Pakistan, which said any disruption to its water supply would be considered an \u201cact of war,\u201d has closed its airspace to Indian airlines and halted all trade with its neighbor.",
      "Analysts inside Pakistan say the government may use the situation to bring the Kashmir issue back into global discussions.",
      "\u201cPakistan can say, look, this happens because of India\u2019s human rights violations in Kashmir,\u201d said Farhan Siddiqi, a professor of international relations at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.",
      "On Wednesday, Kashmir observed a complete shutdown as locals and politicians marched through the streets denouncing the killings. Roads throughout Kashmir were deserted, with shops closed and no transport on the roads.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to exhibit that Kashmiris are nonviolent and peaceful people, and any innocent killings shouldn\u2019t take place on our soil,\u201d said Javed Ahmad Tenga, president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",
      "The United Nations has urged India and Pakistan to \u201cexercise maximum restraint\u201d and called for \u201cmeaningful, mutual engagement.\u201d But Donthi and others say strong Indian military action against Pakistan is likely.",
      "\u201cAnything less than the airstrikes in 2019 will not do. The public is seeking something much bigger,\u201d Donthi said. \u201cAfter riding the tiger of hypernationalism, the government has backed itself into a corner. This is their litmus test and they have to come out with flying colors.\u201d",
      "Junaid Kathju reported from Srinagar, India, and Mithil Aggarwal reported from Hong Kong."

Francis was also known to use football in analogies to convey messages of teamwork, inclusion, hard work and unity.\u00a0He promoted the \u201cMatch for Peace,\u201d where the sport\u2019s top players take part in a friendly match to promote peace and unity.",

      "The pontiff was a card-carrying member of his hometown soccer club, San Lorenzo de Almagro, which was founded by a priest and is named after a saint. As fan No. 88235, the first Latin American pope kept paying dues to the club even after he was at the Vatican.",
      "Francis was such a fan that in 2014, when San Lorenzo won the coveted Copa Libertadores title, the team's leadership went to the Vatican to share in the celebration and gave the pope a replica of their trophy. Later, they announced they wanted a future new stadium to be named after the pontiff.",
      "This week, San Lorenzo President Marcelo Moretti confirmed on a radio show that plans for a new stadium with the pope's name are coming along, and he revealed that Francis got emotional when the team formally asked him years ago whether it could name its future new home after him.",
      "\"He said yes with emotion,\" Moretti told Blu Radio. \"The truth is he was very happy about it.

      "Cuba says it will continue receiving deportation flights from the U.S. based on a previous accord between the two countries, even though the State Department says it has no plans to hold migration talks with the island\u2019s government.",
      "But the suspension of migration talks comes as President Donald Trump continues to crack down on immigrants and carry out what he calls the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. It's not clear how the Trump administration plans larger scale repatriations of Cubans without legal immigration status.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to NBC News that \u201cthe Trump Administration will no longer engage the Cuban regime for the sole sake of engagement and endless dialogue.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have nothing to preview at this time,\u201d the statement said.",
      "When asked about the Trump administration\u2019s comments, the Cuban government told NBC News it will continue to abide by 2017 migration accords it negotiated with\u00a0then-President Barack Obama. At the time, the Cuban government agreed to accept deportations on a case-by-case basis.",
      "But the monthly flights usually have less than 100 people, far below the mass deportations Trump has vowed to carry out. Deportations on a larger scale would have to be negotiated between the two countries.",
      "\u201cBilateral migration talks are not part of the agreements, and they can be carried out even without talks. In fact, they have been a convenient vehicle to aid their implementation, and both governments have determined for most of the past few years that they are useful for mutually defined objectives,\u201d Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez de Cossio told NBC News in an emailed response to questions.",
      "\u201cIt is known that, despite the persistent unilateral hostility of the United States, Cuba is willing to meet to ensure the objectives that both countries have defined regarding migration,\" de Cossio said.",
      "Migration meetings between the two counties have taken place since the 1990s, though they were suspended under the George W. Bush administration and under the first Trump administration. The countries resumed migration talks in 2022 under the Biden administration amid a historic wave of Cuban migrants entering the U.S.",
      "Cubans were among the largest groups of migrants in recent years. U.S. Customs and Border Protection registered over 600,000 encounters with Cubans from fiscal years 2022 to 2024. That number has now dropped dramatically.",
      "As part of the 2017 accords, Obama agreed to end the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy that allowed Cubans who arrived on United States soil without visas to remain in the country legally and gain residency. The Obama administration also eliminated the Cuban Medical Parole program under which Cuban medical professionals on missions overseas could defect and get fast-tracked visas to the United States.",
      "The Trump administration ended a Biden-era parole program that gave temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of applicants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, though it's been temporarily blocked by a judge.",
      "Trump terminated the Biden-era CBP One app that allowed migrants to remain in the U.S. for two years, and this month told them to leave the country immediately. Over 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the app from January 2023 until Trump closed it down on his first day in office. It\u2019s not clear how many were Cuban.",
      "Cuba has long said the U.S. incentivizes migration from the island by devastating its economy through heavy economic sanctions while making it easier for Cubans, in comparison to other groups, to gain residency and then citizenship.",
      "De Cossio stressed that Cuba is \u201ccommitted\u201d to complying with the 2017 agreements.",
      "But he added that \u201cthe strict implementation of the economic blockade remains in place,\" referring to the decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba, \u201cwhich is recognized as an important factor in encouraging Cuban emigration, both regular and irregular, and explains the large presence of our nationals in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt applies a policy of economic warfare that depresses Cubans\u2019 standard of living and drives them to emigrate,\u201d de Cossio said.",
      "He said the U.S. has used migration \u201cfor destabilization purposes against Cuba.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is why we say it is neither fair nor realistic to propose a mass deportation of Cubans in the United States, who have been pushed by U.S. policy and also admitted and protected by U.S. policies. Most have made a life there, have jobs, properties, and family members, and it is not fair to deport them for a change of heart,\u201d de Cossio said.",
      "Official exchanges between the United States and Cuba under the Trump administration have been limited to contact between the two embassies as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cuba and the State Department to discuss specific issues, according to de Cossio.",
      "He said Cuba had summoned the charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in Cuba, Mike Hammer, \u201cto warn him about his conduct that is not what is expected of a diplomat.\u201d",
      "In the last months, Hammer has engaged with prominent political dissidents on the communist island, an issue that also came up during Trump\u2019s first presidency as well.",
      "\u201cOn the part of Cuba, there is a willingness to develop respectful and constructive relations with the United States, regardless of who is president, as long as the standards that should prevail in bilateral ties between sovereign countries are respected,\u201d said de Cossio. \u201cToday, that willingness does not appear to exist in Washington. The narrow and hostile priorities of anti-Cuban sectors incapable of accepting Cuba\u2019s right to full sovereignty and self-determination prevail.\u201d",
      "De Cossio said he didn't see a reason why it's impossible to move toward a \"civilized\" relationship between the two countries and end what he categorized as \"a long-standing, unjust, and highly asymmetrical conflict.\""

      "Almost nine years after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, the suspects accused of stealing $9 million of jewelry will head to court Monday for the start of a high-profile trial that will feature testimony from the reality star.",
      "A total of 10 people, nicknamed the \u201cgrandpa robbers\u201d by French media because of their ages, face charges in connection with the\u00a0break-in at the reality star\u2019s luxury suite\u00a0at the H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, an anonymous-looking building known as \u201cNo Address\u201d frequented by A-list celebrities. The suspects allegedly wore ski masks and clothes with police markings, tied Kardashian up in the bedroom of the luxury suite and robbed her. They are accused of armed robbery, kidnapping or other criminal charges.",
      "All eyes will be on Kardashian when she takes the stand May 13 in the trial which is expected to last a month.",
      "Michael Rhodes, Kardashian\u2019s attorney, said that his client has \u201ctremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system\u201d and that she \u201chas been treated with great respect by the French authorities.\u201d",
      "Kardashian wants the trial to proceed \u201cwith respect for all parties to the case,\u201d he said, and is \u201creserving her testimony for the court and jury.\u201dMonths after the robbery made headlines, Kardashian talked about the incident in an emotional conversation with her sisters, Khloe Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian, that aired in March 2017 during a season 13 episode of E!\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy door was open like this, and then I saw two guys holding another guy down in police uniforms, but right outside of my bedroom, 5 feet away,\u201d an emotional Kardashian said in the scene, a clip of which has been viewed 3.8 million times on E!\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201cSo I slid off my bed and picked up my phone and I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know how to call 911 in a different country, so I call Pascal \u2026 and then the guy came and grabbed the phone from me, threw me on the bed, and I was like, \u2018this is it.\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she saw the two men holding down the concierge, who was handcuffed and had a key to her room. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard from talking to him afterward is, they said, you know, \u2018Where\u2019s the rapper\u2019s wife? Let us up to her room!\u2019 in French,\u201d she said, referring to her then-husband, the artist Ye, formerly Kanye West.",
      "Most of the defendants were arrested three months after the incident occurred as part of a huge police operation that involved piecing together security camera footage and DNA evidence.",
      "But the legal process has been beset by years of delays, with many of the aging defendants now suffering from illnesses such as cancer and heart problems. One of them has since died and another is too unwell to stand trial.",
      "The defendants include: Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \u201cOld Omar,\u201d accused of being the plot\u2019s mastermind; his son and alleged getaway driver, Harminy, 37; Didier \u201cBlue Eyes\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, accused of providing the alleged gang members with information about her whereabouts. One of the accused is a woman, 78-year-old Christiane Glotin, who is accused of being an accomplice in planning the heist.",
      "Under France\u2019s judicial system, defendants in criminal cases do not enter formal pleas. They can admit or deny their guilt, but the trial proceeds regardless. Most cases in France are decided by judges, but as the maximum sentence of this trial is more than 20 years, it will be heard by a jury. There are no television cameras in French courts, so the proceedings will be documented by journalists and sketch artists recounting what happens in the room.",
      "At least one defendant has admitted to his part in the robbery. Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote the 2021 book \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian,\u201d in which he detailed his life story and provided an account of the robbery itself. In the text, he describes being recruited months beforehand for a team to rob an unnamed \u201cwife of an American rapper\u201d \u2014 whose identity he only learned after committing the crime against her.",
      "\u201cA robbery! In the heart of Paris. Just like in the old days. Excitement prickles down my spine,\u201d he wrote of the moment he was hired for the job. However, he said he did not know the target was Kardashian until after the stickup took place.",
      "He described how he and his fellow thieves traveled to her apartments by foot and bicycle \u2014 his own ride suffering a flat tire, he wrote. Their police uniforms meant gaining entry was \u201clike a breeze,\u201d allowed in by the concierge who they then \u201cgently restrained\u201d and used to find Kardashian\u2019s room. He said he stayed on the ground floor while his accomplices robbed Kardashian \u201cwithout violence \u2014 a crucial aspect of the contract.\u201d",
      "But Kardashian has shared a different recollection of the incident, telling comedian David Letterman in a 2021 interview that one of her assailants \u201cgrabbed\u201d her that night.",
      "\u201cI was wearing a robe, and I wasn\u2019t wearing anything under it,\u201d she said on an episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is the time I\u2019m going to get raped. Just deal, it\u2019s going to happen. Just prepare yourself.\u2019\u201d",
      "In the years since the robbery, Kardashian has remained in the public eye and has continued to bolster her brand. With 357 million Instagram followers, she is among the most-followed people online. Skims, the shapewear brand she launched in 2023, is valued at $4 billion, according to Forbes. Kardashian, who in 2019 said she was studying to obtain her law degree, has also been a vocal advocate for justice reform.",
      "She and West, who separated in 2021 and settled their divorce in 2022, share four children together.",
      "The star has returned to Paris since the robbery. However, she has said that the 2016 experience rattled her.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is, meeting with my attorneys and knowing the information that I know now, [the robbers] had been following me for two years,\u201d she told Ellen DeGeneres on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d in April 2017. \u201cThey had been hearing interviews that I did getting excited about this jewelry or this jewelry \u2026 and it\u2019s not to say that I\u2019ll never wear jewelry again or anything like that. I truly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever feel comfortable, I truly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever wear real jewelry again.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy whole life has changed in terms of how I travel,\u201d she added. \u201cI never thought I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry and if you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I\u2019m traveling \u2014 and I didn\u2019t. Now I have several just for me to be able to sleep at night.\u201d"

      "Jokes and memes about the tariffs Trump has imposed on Beijing and other U.S. trading partners have been proliferating online in China, embraced by state media seeking to rally the public as well as ordinary internet users bemused by Trump\u2019s policy decisions.",
      "\u201cThe Lord of Eternal Tariffs,\u201d which can also be translated as \u201c10,000 Tariff Grandpa,\u201d appeared last week in a report by CCTV, China\u2019s state-run broadcaster, which said Americans were \u201crising up in arms\u201d against the tariffs amid fears they could harm the U.S. economy.",
      "As the world\u2019s two largest economies appear at an impasse over tariff levels that amount to a mutual embargo \u2014 a 145% U.S. levy on Chinese goods, and a 125% Chinese levy on goods from the U.S. \u2014Beijing has been allowing such rhetoric to promote the perception that it has the upper hand over Trump.",
      "China has taken a hard line on the trade dispute, with its Commerce Ministry saying Thursday that the U.S. should revoke all unilateral tariffs against China if it \u201ctruly wants to solve the problem.\u201d",
      "Even as the potential impact on their populations begins to sink in, the two countries are far from reaching the kind of trade deal Trump says the tariffs are designed to extract. They can\u2019t even agree on whether talks have started.",
      "Trump said Thursday that U.S. and Chinese officials had met that morning, without specifying who the officials were.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s remarks on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry again disputed that any talks were taking place.",
      "\u201cThere have been no consultations or negotiations between China and the U.S. on tariff issues,\u201d spokesperson Guo Jiakun said. \u201cThe U.S. should not mislead the public.\u201d",
      "Commenters on China\u2019s heavily censored social media have been quick to seize on any suggestion that Trump might blink. Earlier this week, after Trump said the U.S. was \u201cgoing to be very nice\u201d to China and that final tariffs would \u201cnot be anywhere near\u201d 145%, one of the top trending hashtags on the Chinese social media platform Weibo was #TrumpWimpsOut.",
      "Chinese social media users have also satirized what they see as Trump\u2019s strongman aspirations. On RedNote, a Chinese platform similar to Instagram, AI-generated images show Trump dressed like a Chinese emperor.",
      "Others have made fun of the idea of the United States reverting to a nation focused mainly on manufacturing, with one AI-generated video depicting Trump, Elon Musk, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio working on a production line in blue jumpsuits.",
      "Content creators on platforms not accessible in China have also joined in the online mockery. A parody account on YouTube produced a video called \u201cThe Song of MAGA,\u201d in which Trump, Musk, Vance and Rubio march together in front of a banner that says \u201cServe the people,\u201d a political slogan often used by the Chinese government.",
      "\u201cThe Lord of Eternal Tariffs\u201d joins other Chinese nicknames for Trump that have been around since his first term, such as \u201cKing Know-It-All.\u201d One popular transliteration of Trump\u2019s name is \u201cTrump Builds the Nation\u201d \u2014  the nation being China, which some say could become more influential in the world as the Trump administration withdraws from it.",
      "Joking aside, there are indications that both China and the U.S. are looking for ways to minimize the impact of the tariffs on their economies and people. Last week, for example, the Trump administration said that smartphones and other consumer electronics, which are among the biggest Chinese exports to the U.S., would receive tariff exemptions.",
      "Asked Friday about reports that China was considering exempting some U.S. imports from the 125% tariff, Guo, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the situation.",
      "But Beijing is openly pushing a campaign to help companies whose exports could be blocked sell them to the domestic market instead.",
      "Six Chinese online retailers, including JD.com and PDD, now have designated sections to help exporters sell their goods to Chinese consumers, the Ministry of Commerce said Thursday.",
      "Walmart\u2019s China unit has rolled out a similar channel in response to Beijing\u2019s call for the \u201cintegrated development of domestic and foreign trade,\u201d it said Thursday.",
      "At Joy City mall in Beijing, there are new signs that say \u201cExports turned domestic\u201d and \u201cSupport Chinese-made products.\u201d The section sells a wide range of products, including clothes, shoes, suitcases, canned food and even fine porcelain.",
      "Experts say the campaign may not gain much traction given that the Chinese government has struggled for years to boost domestic consumption.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cnaive\u201d for Chinese exporters to make up for their losses by selling in other markets since there are many products that only Americans will buy, such as Christmas decorations, said Andy Xie, an independent economist in Shanghai.",
      "\u201cPeople need to accept the reality that a lot of businesses will eventually all shut down,\u201d he said."

      "A member of the K-pop boy band Just B publicly came out as gay during a concert this week in Los Angeles. It's a rare move in a high-pressure Korean music industry, in which artists tend to be fiercely guarded about their private lives.",
      "Just B-member Bain, 23, made the announcement while performing a solo at the band's L.A. show Tuesday, saying \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a part of the LGBTQ+ community \u2014 as a gay person.\u201d Videos shared on social media showed the crowd responding with loud cheers.",
      "\u201cTo anyone out there who\u2019s part of the LGBTQ+ community, or still figuring it out \u2014 this is for you. You are seen, you are loved, and you were born this way,\u201d he added, in a reference to the song by Lady Gaga whom he called \u201cmy queen.\u201d",
      "He then launched into a performance of the song while waving a rainbow pride flag.",
      "Publicly identifying as gay is rare among active K-pop stars, whose behavior is tightly controlled by music labels and policed by fans who expect them to have wholesome images. According to the Korean media outlet News1, Bain is the first male K-pop star to come out publicly.",
      "After Tuesday's performance, Bain\u2019s bandmate Siwoo left a message of support on a fan platform, South Korean media reported.",
      "\u201cI was watching from backstage and I cried too,\u201d he said. \u201cI cried even more because I knew how hard it was for him.\u201d",
      "Fans have also shown their support, with one of the most popular comments on Bain\u2019s Instagram post saying, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, kiddo. Always love yourself because WE LOVE YOU!!!!\u201d",
      "Just B, a six-member group, has released five EPs and several singles since debuting in 2021.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s outspoken Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen was allowed to leave the Chinese territory to attend Pope Francis\u2019 funeral in Vatican City.",
      "Zen, a 93-year-old retired bishop, left Hong Kong on Wednesday night after applying at a court to get back his passport, his secretary told The Associated Press in a text message on Thursday. Authorities confiscated his passport after his controversial arrest under a Beijing-imposed national security law in 2022.",
      "Zen is among the critics in recent years who have said the Vatican\u2019s agreement with Chinese authorities on the appointment of bishops betrays pro-Vatican Chinese Catholics. He has also criticized Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, the official charged with negotiations with Beijing, as a \u201cman of little faith.\u201d",
      "Parolin is considered one of the main contenders to be the next pope, given his prominence in the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "On Tuesday, media reports said Zen had issued a critique of the Vatican, questioning why pre-conclave meetings started as early as Tuesday. The AP could not independently verify the reports, but Zen reposted the reporters\u2019 posts about his statement on his X account.",
      "Given his age, Zen will not be among the cardinals voting in the conclave for a new pope.",
      "His secretary said Zen would return to Hong Kong after the late pope\u2019s funeral, which is scheduled for Saturday. But she was unsure about his exact return date.",
      "It was not the first time Zen had to go through the city\u2019s court to leave Hong Kong. In 2023, he went through similar procedures to pay his respects to the late Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. He met Pope Francis in a private audience during that trip, but suffered health issues and was hospitalized for a time after his return to the city.",
      "Last November, he was seen attending the national security trial of Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. He could walk on his own at that time.",
      "Zen was first arrested in 2022 on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces under the security law. His arrest sent shockwaves through the Catholic community at that time.",
      "While Zen has not yet faced national security-related charges, he and five others were fined in 2022 after being found guilty of failing to register a now-defunct fund that aimed to help people arrested in widespread 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. A hearing on his appeal against the conviction is scheduled for December.",
      "Separately, Hong Kong cardinal Stephen Chow will travel to the Vatican for the conclave, the city\u2019s Catholic Social Communications Office said Thursday.",
      "In 2023, a Beijing bishop who was installed by China\u2019s state-controlled Catholic church as an archbishop visited Hong Kong at the invitation of Chow. It was the first-ever official visit by a Beijing bishop to the city. Experts at that time said Chow\u2019s invitation was a symbolic gesture that could strengthen the fragile ties between China and the Vatican.",
      "Beijing and the Vatican severed diplomatic ties following the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s rise to power and the expulsion of foreign priests. Since the break in ties, Catholics in China have been divided between those who belong to an official, state-sanctioned church and those in an underground church loyal to the pope. The Vatican recognizes members of both as Catholics but claims the exclusive right to choose bishops."
