      "PARIS -- Oscar contender \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" was named the best French film of the year at the C\u00e9sars awards \u2014 France's equivalent of the Oscars \u2014 and under-fire Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n, the star of Jacques Audiard\u2019s Mexico-set melodrama, made a rare public appearance.",
      "The musical is one of the most celebrated films of the year but has also been criticized for its depiction of Mexican culture and engulfed in controversy because of Gasc\u00f3n's previous social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.",
      "Although Gasc\u00f3n, who was nominated in the best actress category along with her co-star Zoe Salda\u00f1a, did not win a C\u00e9sar, the night in Paris was triumphal for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which swept seven trophies.",
      "Audiard, who previously condemned Gasc\u00f3n's comments, thanked his \u201cmarvelous team\u201d and his female actors.",
      "\u201cWhen I say my team it\u2019s not in the sense of ownership, but a declaration of love,\u201d he said. \"The same goes for the actresses. My darling Zoe, my darling Karla, Adriana (Paz) who is not here, Selena (Gomez) who is not here. I loved working with you, I love you.\u201d",
      "Old posts from Gascon\u2018s X account resurfaced in January, some going as far back as 2016, that took aim at Muslims\u2019 dress, language and culture in her native Spain. She also suggested that Islam be banned. And less than a month after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020, Gasc\u00f3n offered her assessment of Floyd \u2014 whose death prompted widespread reckoning with police brutality and racism \u2014 as a drug addict who \u201cvery few people ever cared\u201d for.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations. Audiard has condemned her comments.",
      "If it manages to steer through the backlash and go home the big winner at the Oscars on Sunday, it would hand Netflix its first best picture win. Gasc\u00f3n is the first openly trans actor nominated for best actress and a win would be even more historic, although her chances of taking the award home now appear very slim.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who has issued an apology for her old posts, attended the 50th anniversary of the C\u00e9sars ceremony presided over by Catherine Deneuve at the Olympia theater in Paris. She wore a black dress and posed for photographers but did not speak to reporters.",

      "In Paris, Gasc\u00f3n and Salda\u00f1a were nominated for the C\u00e9sar for best actress, but it was handed to French actor Hafsia Herzi for her performance in \u201cBorgo.\u201d Best actor went to Karim Leklou for his performance in \u201cLe Roman de Jim\u201d (Jim's Story).",
      "Julia Roberts was also in Paris on Friday to receive an honorary C\u00e9sar for her career achievements. She was called onto the stage by Clive Owen, with whom she starred in \u201cCloser\u201d and \u201cDuplicity,\u201d and was treated to a standing ovation."

The official red carpet preshow on ABC and Hulu starts at 6:30 p.m. Unofficial E! red carpet coverage begins at 4 p.m. EST and The Associated Press will livestream arrivals beginning at 3 p.m.",

      "The fires affected many throughout the film industry and within the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. Some even called for the cancellation of Hollywood\u2019s awards season. While his Pacific Palisades house was spared, O\u2019Brien has been living out of a hotel the last two months. Oscar producers have said the show will celebrate the city\u2019s resilience.",
      "The lead nominee is Netflix\u2019s \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d with 13 nominations, but that film has seen its chances crater following uproar over years-old offensive tweets by its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the first openly trans actor nominated for best actress.",
      "The favorite is Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d about a sex worker who weds the son of a Russian oligarch. The Neon release, the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or winner, won with the producers, directors and writers guild. The only movie with the same resume to not win best picture is \u201cBrokeback Mountain.\u201d",
      "Its closest competition is \u201cConclave,\u201d the papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes. It won at the BAFTAs and the SAG Awards, wins that came just as Pope Francis was hospitalized for double pneumonia. Oscar voting concluded before the pope fell ill.",
      "Also in the mix are \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d nominated for 10 awards, and the musical hit \u201cWicked,\u201d also with 10 nominations. Several of the early craft Oscars could be shared between \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "For the first time, an actor is nominated for playing the sitting U.S. president. Sebastian Stan is nominated for best actor for his performance as a young Donald Trump in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d as is his co-star, Jeremy Strong, for playing Roy Cohn. Trump has called those involved with the film \u201chuman scum.\u201d",
      "The political tenor of this year\u2019s ceremony could be volatile, with the Oscars coming weeks into the second Trump administration and falling two days after the president\u2019s dramatic rupture with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.",
      "Speaking earlier this week, O\u2019Brien said he'll strive to strike a delicate balance.",
      "\u201cI cannot ignore the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also have to remember it\u2019s threading a needle. I also have to remember what we\u2019re here to celebrate and infuse the show with positivity.\u201d",
      "While the supporting acting categories feature overwhelming favorites in Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) and Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d), both best actor and best actress are close contests.",
      "In best actress, Demi Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) is most likely to win, but Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) or Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could pull off the upset.",
      "Adrien Brody is favored in best actor for his performance in \u201cThe Brutalist. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stands a decent chance of beating him, for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The 29-year-old Chalamet, who won at the Screen Actors Guild, would become the youngest best actor winner ever, edging Brody\u2019s record, set in 2003 in his win for \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d",
      "This year's Oscars are unspooling after a turbulent year for the film industry. Ticket sales were down 3% from the previous year and more significantly from pre-pandemic times. The strikes of 2023 played havoc with release schedules in 2024. Many studios pulled back on production, leaving many out of work. The fires, in January, only added to the pain.",
      "Last year\u2019s telecast, propelled by the twin blockbusters of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie,\u201d led the Oscars to a four-year viewership high, with 19.5 million viewers. This year, with smaller independent films favored in the most prominent awards, the academy will be tested to draw as large of an audience.",
      "With a not particularly starry array of best song nominees, the academy has done away with performances of original songs this year.

      "An artist in Denmark aims to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that opened Friday that includes three piglets who will be denied food and water and will starve to death.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that happens to thousands each day in the industry doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d she said. But she also praised the artist for asking \u201cthe large questions about who we are as human beings or want to be, and what we are doing to fellow creatures in the name of enormous amounts of mass-produced cheap meat.\u201d",
      "Damm explained that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, and leading to the starvation of many. She said some 25,000 piglets die every day from starvation or the result of the conditions in which they are held in Denmark.",
      "It's not Evaristti's first controversial project.",
      "One of his projects included goldfish in blenders, tempting viewers to press the button and create goldfish soup.",
      "In 2006 he used some of his own body fat removed via liposuction to prepare meatballs, and then ate some of them.",
      "He described that project called \u201cPolpette Al Grasso Di Marco\u201d as a critique on people overconsuming and then buying their way to slimness with liposuction, and at the same time an attempt to transcend the taboo of cannibalism.",

      "A depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children\u2019s television program",
      "BERLIN -- Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze: a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults.",
      "A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, \"Mist!\" (Think \u201ccrap!\u201d in English.)",
      "Played and voiced by puppeteer J\u00f6rg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can\u2019t wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper.",
      "This year, his friends \u2014 a sheep and a flower bush \u2014 are urging him to become a bread influencer.",
      "Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, creator Tommy Krappweis drew Bernd's infamous grimace after co-creator Norman C\u00f6ster's face when they were asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children\u2019s public television channel.",
      "Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf \u2014 white bread typically sliced for sandwiches \u2014 with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining and dry sense of humor and irony.",
      "Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more-optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush.",
      "Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time.",
      "The move brought an adult audience \u2014 often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying \u2014 into Bernd's world, cementing his popularity as a German cult classic.",
      "In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize \u2014 the German television equivalent of an Emmy \u2014 because the jury said he represents \u201cthe right to be in a bad mood.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t feel well sometimes. That\u2019s completely fine,\u201d Krappweis, Bernd's creator, said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary.",
      "Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort).",
      "But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart.",
      "\u201cA long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,\u201d Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. \u201cBut unfortunately it was in vain.",
      "\u201cShe only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.\u201d",
      "Despite Bernd\u2019s best efforts \u2014 one of his catchphrases is \u201cI would like to leave this show\u201d \u2014 the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he\u2019s been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like \u201cGive Us Our Daily Bernd.\u201d",
      "He was even kidnapped! In 2009, his 2-meter-tall (6.56 feet) statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based.",
      "A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd\u2019s kidnapping and the video was removed from the internet.",
      "Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks.",
      "KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary \u2014 despite his complaints \u2014 with new episodes, an update to his hit song and online activities for kids and adults alike. The celebrations begin now, as Bernd\u2019s birthday is Feb. 29.",
      "The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel \u201cBetter with Bernd\" in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer.",
      "The trio will present inventions to make school, and life, easier for viewers but naturally their concoctions backfire. Bernd instead becomes a defluencer \u2014 and an involuntary trendsetter.",

      "Marcelo Rubens Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d became a box-office success",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian author Marcelo Rubens Paiva happily swung his wheelchair from side to side, dancing with thousands of Carnival revelers there to celebrate him and his work. Seconds later, an unidentified man showed Paiva his middle finger, then threw a beer can and a backpack that hit him in the head.",
      "Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d became a box-office success. The film, a rare blockbuster in the South American nation, garnered three Oscar nominations ahead of the awards ceremony Sunday.",
      "While millions of Brazilians love the story for its long-overdue truth-telling about the country\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, others see it as left-wing propaganda. Paiva has been dismayed at the outpouring of hatred, mostly online, directed at him.",
      "\u201cIt is simply (our) history being told in the way we believe it must be told, the way our family lived it, so it never happens again,\u201d Paiva, 65, told The Associated Press in his Sao Paulo apartment. \u201cI assure you that some of those on the far-right or on the right have watched it and maybe changed their opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is up for best picture and best international feature, while Fernanda Torres, who portrayed Paiva's mother Eunice, is competing for best actress. The film centers on the disappearance of Rubens Paiva, the author's father, and Eunice's decadeslong quest to force authorities to confirm his death.",
      "Paiva, one of five siblings, has known success, but not as much controversy. His 1982 book \u201cHappy Old Year\u201d narrating his life before and after a diving accident put him in a wheelchair, sold more than 1.5 million copies. He is also an award-winning playwright, former TV talk show host and political activist.",
      "But he says nothing prepared him for the sudden impact \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d had since it won best screenplay at the Venice Film Festival. Many other awards followed since.",
      "\u201cThis is very different; it is more intense because of social networks,\" Paiva said. \u201cPeople (around the world) react in the same way to this movie, with the same emotion that Brazilians felt.\u201d",
      "After his book about his accident, he knew he still had another important story to tell.",
      "\u201cI was the son of a disappeared politician; few people knew what had happened during the dictatorship,\u201d he said.",
      "That was largely because Congress passed an amnesty law in 1979, as the dictatorship neared its end, sparing perpetrators of political crimes from prosecution.",
      "Cracks started to emerge in 2011 after then President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses. It was one of the seeds for Paiva's book and, later, the film.",
      "\u201cPeople were asking for reparations for families of missing politicians, they sued my father\u2019s torturers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military showed they were upset, because their colleagues and their fellow coup mongers were under fire. The accusations were being published, so they started to threaten Brazil\u2019s democracy. And little by little it was once again in doubt.\u201d",
      "Past ire toward the Paiva family has notably come from one man: Jair Bolsonaro, the former army captain who rode a wave of anti-establishment populism to his presidency (2019-2022).",
      "In 2014, then-lawmaker Bolsonaro spat on a statue of the late Paiva in Congress, accusing him and his family of being at the service of communist terrorists. His claims date to the 1990s and falsely link a farm the Paiva family owned, near where Bolsonaro grew up, to a guerrilla group.",
      "\u201cEvery year, he made a speech against my father, making up stories,\u201d Paiva said. \u201cOnce, he said my father had been killed by his comrades who were in the armed struggle, because he had revealed things during the torture sessions. It was the first time I heard anyone tell such an absurd story, with no evidence, and people believed it. It was the first time I saw the power of social media in creating a new narrative, a lie.\"",
      "Bolsonaro said in an interview Monday he hasn't seen the film, but his allies have railed against it, saying Paiva died in a war, as did many on both sides. Brazil\u2019s Truth Commission found that at least 434 people died at the hands of the military regime, including 136 who disappeared.",
      "Paiva published \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d as Alzheimer\u2019s disease washed away his mother\u2019s memory. Director Walter Salles bought the rights in 2017, but chose not to make the film during Bolsonaro's presidency. Last week, Brazil's prosecutor-general indicted Bolsonaro for allegedly staging a coup to remain in power. It included inciting a riot in capital Brasilia by encouraging his supporters to riot marking an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cPeople everywhere are afraid of watching their democracies become dictatorships,\" Paiva said. \"This movie glorifies democracy and the understanding that human rights, empathy are in short supply.\u201d",
      "Adding to Paiva's recent achievements since the film premiered, his father\u2019s death certificate, first obtained by his mother in 1996, was updated in January to go beyond mere confirmation to include: \u201cviolent death caused by the Brazilian State in the context of systematic persecution to the population identified as dissidents of the policies of the dictatorial regime installed in 1964.\u201d",
      "Brazil's Supreme Court said earlier this week it will rule whether the sole survivor among Rubens Paiva\u2019s torturers, Gen. Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Nogueira Belham, can be tried. Brazilian human rights activists have argued that concealing bodies is a continuous crime not covered by the country\u2019s amnesty law.",
      "\u201cI see literature as a mission, and I feel mine was accomplished,\" said Paiva. \u201cThe movie\u2019s mission is accomplished, even if it doesn\u2019t win any Oscars.\u201d",

      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d",
      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d His umbilical cable has severed. The support vessel above is aimlessly drifting away from the site through violent, stormy waters. And the diver has only ten minutes of oxygen in his backup tank.",
      "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s also a true story.",
      "If merely reading this is giving you heart palpitations already, you can only imagine the white-knuckle experience of watching this all play out on the big screen. It\u2019s 40ish minutes of pure suspense and anxiety as the story shuffles between the man at the bottom of the ocean, Chris Lemons (Finn Cole), his fellow saturation divers (Woody Harrelson as Duncan and Simu Liu as Dave) in the diving bell below the waters who are unable to help and the crew in the support vessel above (including Cliff Curtis and Mark Bonnar) scrambling to get their systems back online and operational as the clock rapidly runs out. Ten minutes has never felt so short \u2014 and then it just gets worse as the clock starts counting up, showing Chris\u2019s time without oxygen.",
      "At one point, Liu\u2019s character Dave, a no-nonsense, all-business diver says matter-of-factly at that it\u2019s a body recovery, not a rescue. Deep-sea saturation diving is a dangerous business, described at the start of the film as the most dangerous job on earth. Chris tells his fianc\u00e9, in a short introduction, that it\u2019s no more dangerous than going to space. She replies that it\u2019s funny that he thinks that is comforting.",
      "The real incident happened in September 2012 \u2014 Dave, Duncan and Chris were just one team of divers sent to the ocean floor off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, to repair oil pipeline.",
      "The seas were particularly rough that day, with winds up to 35 knots, common for the North Sea but also not what one might call safe. Chris and Dave were in the middle of their work when they heard the urgent calls to abort: The dynamic positioning system in the support vessel above had failed and they were in drift. Chris scrambled to maneuver out of the pipeline corridors, but his umbilical got caught. For a brief, awful moment he\u2019s the anchor to the ship above, but soon enough the cord snapped, and he was thrown back to the ocean floor in pitch black with no coms, no heat and very little hope for survival. News articles about the incident clock his backup oxygen supply as being closer to five or six minutes \u2013 perhaps the movie wanted to give the audience a little buffer.",
      "If this sounds at all familiar, it may be because it was made into a documentary, also called \u201cLast Breath\u201d and released in 2019. While it was well-received, some true stories are just too gripping to exist solely in that form. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that a narrative film was made as well. There\u2019s a good track record of recent complimentary adaptations \u2014 think Ron Howard\u2019s \u201c13 Lives\u201d and \u201cThe Rescue\u201d about the Thai boys soccer team stuck in the cave.",
      "This one was made by Alex Parkinson, the same director who co-directed the doc, and it\u2019s a well-executed narrative interpretation that doesn\u2019t get in its own way with padding. Harrelson gets to be the wise mentor who really doesn\u2019t want to lose someone on his last mission. Liu gets to flex his action muscles (literally and figuratively) in a modest but solid role. And they don't go out of their way to shoehorn in a villain \u2014 this is just a group of people trying their best to save a life.",
      "The only real problem, if one can even call it that, is that it\u2019s so short. The film doesn\u2019t take liberties with stretching out the timeline much at all and after 93 minutes, the whole thing is over. It feels strange to want a movie to be longer, but in the case of \u201cLast Breath\u201d I was both desperate for it to end, for anxiety reasons, and also wanting more.",
      "\u201cLast Breath,\u201d a Focus Features release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 Motion Picture Association for \u201cbrief strong language.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "A US porn actor has traveled to Afghanistan in a trip unacknowledged by the Taliban, who have restricted the rights of women and girls and imposed strict morality laws since seizing power in 2021.",
      "Whitney Wright, who caused uproar with a visit to Iran last year as authorities there cracked down on women, posted images of her trip to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan on her Instagram account.",
      "They show a plane from national carrier Ariana on a runway, a tiled ceiling from the Western city of Herat, supermarket items and vehicles. Wright does not appear in the images.",
      "She did not respond to messages from The Associated Press on Friday. Nobody from the Taliban was immediately available for comment.",
      "The Taliban are keen to attract tourists and promote a different side of the country. Foreigners are visiting, encouraged by the drop in violence.",
      "As a U.S. citizen born in Oklahoma City, Wright would need a visa to enter Afghanistan but there are no operational Afghan embassies or consulates in the U.S. The Taliban have control of some 40 diplomatic missions around the world.",
      "The State Department says U.S. citizens should not travel to Afghanistan for any reason due to civil unrest, crime, terrorism, kidnapping and limited health facilities. It also says there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals.",
      "Wright has traveled to Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon in recent years."

      "\u201cI believe it is a magic place,\u2019\u2019 said Puglisi, the brand's creative director. \u201cThrough the eruption everything was destroyed but we are able to contemplate and admire the beauty of the Roman empire in Pompeii.\u201d\u201d",

      "\u201cTo work in this difficult moment is really tough,\u201d Prada said backstage. Sidestepping overtly political discussion, she added: \u201dWhat we try to do are clothes that make sense for women today.\"",
      "Prada's Fall-Winter 2025-26 collection aimed to liberate women from strictly feminine forms. In that way the little black dress series and other runway looks were loosely constructed, not body-hugging.",

      "Raw seams were intentionally revealed on garments. Waistlines were gathered as if by basting, and could be moved from the waist for a midi-skirt or over the bust for a minidress.",
      "\u201cI would also say that we have rejected a lot of construction,\" Simons said, specifically construction that restricts movement.",
      "It\u2019s a mix-and-match world at Prada and just about any of the pieces work as separates: Short-sleeve and tube knitwear tops were bedecked with baubles, like found treasures. Men\u2019s shirts scrunched messily at the waist, as if they came untucked.",
      "Staples were glammed up with faux fur stoles and fur lapels on coats, blazers and a striking lime green poncho.",

This is something I am overwhelmed with gratitude to be a part of.\u201d",
      "Murakami, initially known for paintings and sculptures, saw his popularity explode when he paired with Louis Vuitton in 2002 for a line of bags featuring his artwork. The bags, which featured his iconic flower motifs and quirky characters in bright colors, quickly became some of the brand\u2019s most coveted items.",

    "story": [
      "The Metropolitan Opera is staging a production of Herman Melville's masterpiece about a white whale, \u2018Moby-Dick",
      "When Leonard Foglia was invited to direct an opera based on Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece about a white whale, his first reaction was: \u201cMoby-Dick. That\u2019s great!\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I ran to a used bookstore and got the book,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I thought: \u2018Oh my God, what am I in for here?\u2019 It\u2019s so daunting. I didn\u2019t panic, but I thought, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "How he and his collaborators did it will be on display at the Metropolitan Opera beginning March 3. The opera is composed by Jake Heggie to a libretto crafted by Gene Scheer.",
      "To begin with, Scheer had to whittle a novel of more than 600 pages down to a 64-page libretto. He kept as much of Melville\u2019s language as possible, and estimates that 40% to 50% of his libretto can be found in the original text, though he often tweaked the phrasing to make it more singable.",
      "Heggie and his initial partner, Terrence McNally (who withdrew for health reasons), had already decided to lop off the opening chapters, which take place on land. They set the entire opera aboard the whale-hunting ship Pequod.",
      "Another crucial change was renaming the narrator, calling him Greenhorn to reflect his status as a novice aboard the ship. Now the book\u2019s famous opening line, \u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d is transposed to the very end of the opera when the character has matured.",
      "\u201cIn the novel, Ishmael is telling a story that happened many years ago,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut in the theater, you want to see it happen in real time. \u2026 We\u2019re watching him take in all the experiences so that when he says \u2018Call me Ishmael,\u2019 he\u2019s ready to write the book. In essence, this opera is the education of Ishmael.\u201d",
      "Tenor Stephen Costello, who is performing the role for the fifth time and is the lone cast holdover from the Dallas premiere in 2010, sees his character as \u201cthe only one who really has an arc.",
      "\u201cHe goes on the Pequod because there was nothing for him on land,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo he\u2019s either going to die at sea or figure out who he is.\u201d",
      "In addition to Costello, the Met cast includes tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the vengeance-obsessed Captain Ahab. Pip, his cabin boy, is written as a \u201ctrousers role\u201d (a male character portrayed by a woman) and will be sung by soprano Janai Brugger. Starbuck, the first mate, will be baritone Peter Mattei, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green will sing the part of Queequeg. Karen Kamensek conducts the eight performances through March 29.",
      "The opera, commissioned to celebrate the opening of a new opera house in Dallas, has been a success from the beginning, drawing praise from audiences and critics \u2014 and even scholars.",
      "Bob Wallace, a professor at Northern Kentucky University and past president of the Melville Society, admired the opera so much that he wrote a book about its creation.",
      "\u201cScheer and Heggie did a brilliant job of shrinking the novel to make it fit the stage and yet preserve so much of the essence of it,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "As much as critics admired Scheer\u2019s adaptation and Heggie\u2019s tuneful, atmospheric and at times gripping score, they lavished special praise on the physical production, with sets by Robert Brill and projections by Elaine J. McCarthy.",
      "The action, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cplayed out against a multimedia-enriched staging that ranged from striking to near-miraculous.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most stunning effect is the way animated projections superimposed on a climbing wall that is curved a bit like a skateboard ramp create the illusion of the crew leaving the Pequod to board three whaling boats.",
      "\u201cA lot of the excitement and thrill of watching this is due to the work of the production team,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cLenny kept saying to me, \u2019You imagine it the way you want it, and let me figure out how to do it.\u201d",
      "That often involved imposing unusual physical demands on the singers. For instance, when Pip gets lost at sea, his character sings the equivalent of an operatic mad scene dangling high above the stage, with projections making it appear he\u2019s treading water.",
      "\u201cI said to Janai when we first rehearsed it,\u201d Foglia recalled, \u201cOK, you can just get mad at me now, because you have to sing your hardest aria hanging from not even a full harness, just a single wire.\u201d",
      "In addition, Queequeg and Greenhorn climb up and down ladders to sing at the top of the mastheads. Ahab, who has lost a leg in a prior encounter with Moby-Dick, has to hobble on a wooden prosthesis. And Greenhorn \u2014 finally named Ishmael \u2014 ends the opera grabbing onto a whale hook from a passing ship that lifts him to safety.",
      "\u201cI joke with them that everything opera singers count on in life \u2014 having both feet planted on the ground \u2014 I\u2019ve taken away from them,\u201d Foglia said.",

      "The SAG Awards are also a union meeting, and this group, who went on a historic strike in 2023, were asked through fliers at place settings, a video that played during a break, and a pre-telecast plea from their leader to support their striking colleagues who work on video games.",

      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

But the team behind last year\u2019s show is \u201caiming for the stars\u201d once more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling the pressure,\u201d said Oscars executive producer and showrunner Raj Kapoor. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ones to rest on our laurels. We always want to push the envelope.\u201d",
      "With just days to go until the three-and-a-half hour live broadcast, airing on ABC and streaming live on Hulu Sunday, March 2, the team behind the show gave The Associated Press a little insight into what to expect.",
      "\u201cWe want people when they watch the Oscars to be inspired by the films but also be inspired by the broadcast and feel something like it\u2019s a show that you can watch with your friends and your family and debate on who should have won and who is winning,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cWe want people to have all the feels when they watch the show.\u201d",

O\u2019Brien, he said, has been a \u201cwealth of ideas and imagination\u201d since he accepted the gig and that he and his team are going to keep writing up until the show \u2014 and as a veteran of live television, he's skilled at in-the-moment improvisation as well.",
      "\u201cHe is going to be this great, exciting, warm hug and guide us through the night,\u201d said Oscars executive producer Katy Mullan. \u201cHe\u2019s got some surprises up his sleeve, which is fantastic because we love to keep people guessing.\u201d",
      "The Oscars this year decided to nix performances of the original songs, but there will still be some big names gracing the stage including \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo \u2014 though they\u2019re staying mum on whether any gravity will be defied in that performance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for months,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a moment that\u2019s been very special.\u201d",
      "Lisa of Blackpink and Doja Cat will also be part of the broadcast, and the producers promised a musical moment that will honor Los Angeles and filmmaking in Hollywood.",
      "The wildfires, Mullan said, will be acknowledged in the show.",
      "\u201cThe Grammys did an incredible job with their show and how it was treated,\u201d Mullan said. \u201cOur show being a month after that and Conan having been affected himself, we\u2019re just looking at the right way to calibrate it so that it feels like the right show for March 2 \u2014 that we do acknowledge it and reflect on it but also allow people the chance to step on that stage and have their moment and celebrate their talent.\"",
      "Last year the Oscars made a moment out of what is usually just a list of names by inviting past Oscar acting winners to speak about each of the nominees before the winner was read. This year it's back, but evolved. It won\u2019t be the actors this time, but some of the other categories that \u201cmaybe don\u2019t normally get the spotlight on the Oscar stage,\u201d Mullan said.",
      "She added: \u201cOur theme is all about collaboration and the alchemy of filmmaking and really taking a look behind the scenes and understanding a bit more of the interconnectedness of how a film comes together.\u201d",
      "First, Mullan said, it\u2019s only Wednesday \u2014 there\u2019s still time to catch the diverse group of 10 best picture nominees before Sunday if you really try. But don\u2019t fret if you\u2019ve only seen a few. The show could be a discovery event.",
      "\u201cIf you love the movies, like come to the Oscars and maybe you\u2019ll discover things that you actually have not seen yet but will want to,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cHopefully you\u2019ll fall in love even with a few pictures while watching the show.\u201d",

      "New York musician Larry Saltzman isn't really a movie fan, but he'll be sure to watch the Oscars this year",
      "NEW YORK -- He's not a movie buff, so New York musician Larry Saltzman doesn't always watch the Oscars. This year, however, he's got a rooting interest.",
      "Saltzman taught actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet how to play guitar for the role of Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d In turn, Chalamet earned a best actor nomination and the film is also up for best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday.",
      "A guitarist who's performed with Simon & Garfunkel, Bette Midler and David Johansen, as well as in the pit at Broadway productions \u201cHairspray\u201d and \u201cAin't Too Proud to Beg,\u201d Saltzman has developed a specialty in teaching actors how to play music for their roles. Besides Chalamet, recent pupils have included Adam Driver and Sadie Sink of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d",
      "On a fellow musician's recommendation, Saltzman first got a call from a movie studio about a decade ago. He admits to being cranky as discussions dragged on. \u201cI almost did everything to talk them out of hiring me,\u201d he said.",
      "Not until the fifth phone call did the studio identify the client: Meryl Streep.",
      "She needed to learn the electric guitar for her starring role in the 2015 film \u201cRicki and the Flash,\u201d where she portrayed an aging rocker trying to keep her career and life together in the wake of a series of disappointments.",
      "Working with Streep is a little like a political consultant's first client being elected president. If she likes you and word gets around, other students will follow. Teaching actors now represents about 40% of his business, the 69-year-old said.",
      "\u201cMy time spent with her was excellent,\u201d he said of Streep. \u201cShe's smart. She knows how to learn things. There was a steady progress over three or four months. She did very well.\u201d",
      "Faking it just won't do for serious actors and film directors. It's like lip-syncing \u2014 the audience is going to tell the difference, and the characters will be less believable. That was especially true with Chalamet, who needed to sing and play at the same time for a character whose artistry is the centerpiece of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen the actors come to you, they're kind of vulnerable,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThey want to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Saltzman had more than 50 sessions with Chalamet, starting in person and retreating to Zoom during the pandemic. It wasn't easy. Chalamet had to learn some 25 songs in the script.",
      "\u201cSometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID,\u201d Chalamet recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.\u201d",
      "It helped that Saltzman is a Dylan buff. Focusing on imparting \u201cthe guitar playing of \u2018pre-electric Bob,\u2019\u201d he taught his charge so well that Chalamet was a musical guest as well as host on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d performing obscure Dylan cuts last month. Saltzman says, in the course of their sessions, Chalamet \u201cwent the extra mile\u201d and unearthed \u201cvery early, obscure\u201d Dylan songs that weren't even in the script.",
      "Saltzman generally likes teaching actors more than common folk, in part because there's a specific goal: They need to learn certain songs to inhabit a particular character. When it's open-ended \u2014 someone just wants to learn the guitar \u2014 it can be more of a challenge, he said. Saltzman also believes that it's an advantage to not be a regular teacher, someone who may approach clients with a more rigid style.",
      "Actor Johnny Cannizzaro said he appreciated Saltzman's calming \u201cbedside manner\u201d and felt welcome in an apartment filled with guitars. Cannizzaro has the role of E Street Band member \u201cLittle Steven\u201d Van Zandt in the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic, \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was never really a moment where he expressed any sort of frustration or impatience with me during a session,\u201d said Cannizzaro, who has background playing keyboards but not guitar. \u201cIf anything, he would express some excitement when you grasped something he was teaching. That put me at ease.\u201d",
      "Saltzman also studied film of Van Zandt so he wasn't just teaching Cannizzaro guitar \u2014 he was showing specifics of how Van Zandt plays, the actor said.",
      "Beyond teaching, Saltzman's time is divided between studio work, playing in New York clubs accompanying different artists and Broadway \u2014 he's just about to begin \u201cSmash.\u201d",
      "It's an eye-opening experience for him to later see his students on screen. That was particularly the case when he saw \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and marveled at Chalamet's ability as an actor.",
      "All the more reason to watch the Oscars, and to take some pride in his own work.",
      "\u201cIn my own humble way, I'm a small gear in that machinery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is rewarding is knowing that in some small way I'm contributing to making a better film.\u201d",

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",
      "Michael Cannon, a director of health studies at libertarian Cato Institute, believes Medicaid needs an overhaul because it is a significant part of the federal budget and a contributor to the nation's growing debt.",
      "But Republicans, he said, are not looking at serious ways to drive down the cost of health care.",
      "\u201cThe only reason for the cuts right now is to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cNone of them are talking about the need to do better health reform.\u201d",

      "The stories of two nurses who survived a gunman's attack on an intensive care unit in a York, Pennsylvania, hospital are being shared in Facebook posts that reveal new details",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A nurse who survived an armed man\u2019s attack on an intensive care unit in a Pennsylvania hospital said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that she was held against him as a shield at gunpoint, arms zip-tied behind her back, as they walked through a doorway and encountered a phalanx of responding police officers.",
      "Nurse Tosha Trostle wrote that she had begged the attacker to let her go and that he pushed the gun against her neck and spine. When they encountered police, she prayed as she heard gunshots and smelled smoke, then heard bullet casings hitting the floor, she wrote.",
      "\u201cI eventually fell into the floor under the weight of the shooter\u2019s body. The officers told me to run. I struggled to get out from under him,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI remember his limp cold hand against my face as I pushed away with my feet.\u201d",
      "She fell twice trying to get to her feet before an officer guided her into another room.",
      "Phone and Facebook messages were left for Trostle on Wednesday. A nurse from the hospital who didn\u2019t want to be identified by name because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the events confirmed the posting was from Trostle\u2019s Facebook account.",
      "Authorities say Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, brought a gun and zip ties to UPMC Memorial Hospital in York on Saturday morning and was holding hostages when responding officers fatally shot him.",
      "West York Patrolman Andrew Duarte, 30, was shot and killed. Two other officers and three hospital employees were wounded, authorities said.",
      "Trostle recounted that she had been drawing blood when she heard a commotion and went into a hallway.",
      "\u201cAfter all I thought I was responding to a staff assist, patient fall, one in a dozen possible occurrences; not an active shooter. When I rounded the corner of the back hall I was met in the distance by the shooter holding my coworker, Jess, at gunpoint,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Her colleague, Jessica Breighner, was forced to zip-tie her.",
      "\u201cI saw the fear in her eyes, fear does not sound like enough really though,\u201d Trostle wrote.",
      "The attacker\u2019s shoes became etched into Trostle\u2019s mind as she lay at his feet, thinking the gun might have jammed and then hearing him reload, she added.",
      "\u201cSo many things happened I cannot recount step by step,\" she wrote, \"but how I remember those red sneakers.\"",
      "Jason Huff, Breighner\u2019s partner of more than 20 years, also described the incident in a separate Facebook post on Wednesday that said the attacker had pulled the trigger three times with the gun against Breighner\u2019s head, but it was apparently out of ammunition.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when she knew it was time to take her shot,\u201d Huff wrote. \u201cShe broke her zip ties while he reloaded and ran -- thank God.\u201d",
      "Huff told The Associated Press she hopes to talk publicly about it later, with the others who survived the attack.",
      "Huff wrote on Facebook that before fleeing, Breighner had to \u201clisten to this criminal call and warn someone to clean out the apartment and get the jewelry because he\u2019s not coming home and was ready to die.\u201d",
      "York County District Attorney Tim Barker said Saturday that Archangel-Ortiz appeared to have had recent contact with the intensive care unit \u201cfor a medical purpose involving another person\u201d but declined to elaborate.",
      "Asked about the nurses\u2019 accounts, a UPMC spokesperson said the health system prioritizes safety and privacy but referred questions to law enforcement.",
      "Trostle said the attacker \u201chauled me off the floor pushing me into the adjacent wall,\u201d where Breighner's photo was among pictures of the group\u2019s leadership on the wall.",
      "\u201cPushing the gun into my neck and spine. I begged to go home to my children. He petted my head and promised I would that I was doing everything right,\u201d Trostle wrote.",
      "She said he directed her to take him to the floor where the most people were. As they went through a doorway, they encountered what she called \u201ca wall of armed officers aimed at us.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, she was led down a stairway. In the days since, the memory has haunted Trostle and her family, she said.",
      "\u201cMy physical injuries do not even compare fractionally to what injuries are unseen,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI live with immense sadness and guilt of all who responded, their mental and physical injuries. Especially, brave Officer Andrew Duarte that gave his life to bring us home.\u201d",
      "Duarte's funeral service is scheduled for Friday in York."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

      "The latest development comes as health workers conclude a targeted vaccination drive in high-risk areas later Friday. Earlier this month, authorities launched a weeklong nationwide anti-polio campaign aiming to immunize 44.2 million children under the age of five.",
      "Escorted by police, polio teams go door-to-door to administer the oral vaccine, though they are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children.

Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",

      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d",

      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",

      "Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth",
      "EL PASO, Texas -- On the Texas border, Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth.",
      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",
      "The other accused doctors \u2014 both in Dallas \u2014 are under temporary court orders not to see patients and only practice medicine in research and academic settings.",
      "\u201cLooking at the patients was hard because they were kind of disappointed of what was going on,\u201d Granados said of ending their care. \u201cBut it was something that needed to be followed because it\u2019s the law.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",
      "Granados is one of two pediatric endocrinologists in El Paso, a desert city of about 700,000 where mountains rise in the distance.",
      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Lorena Edwards, said Granados put a \u201ccold stop\u201d to her daughter\u2019s care.",
      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normal people, too, and we\u2019re just trying to live,\u201d she said.",

      "A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims",
      "VANNES, France -- A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.",
      "He does not deny the allegations, though says he doesn't remember everything. Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to prison terms ranging from three to 20 years.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations have called for a rally on Monday in front of the courthouse where Le Scouarnec will be tried.",
      "The case began in 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor said Le Scouarnec had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "He had admitted to child abuse dating to 1985-1986, but some cases could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine alleged rapes and other abuses committed between 1989 and 2014 against 158 men and 141 women who were aged 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to investigation documents.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the post-operation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital when she was 9 years old in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot.\"",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,\u201d she told public broadcaster France 3. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression. ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper his client will \u201canswer the judges\u2019 questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",

      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d starring Natalie Morales and Sonequa Martin-Green, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow",
      "Even for a film titled \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d the opening scenes of Kyle Hausmann-Stoke\u2019s movie have a startling rhythm.",
      "First, two female American soldiers are riding in a Humvee in Afghanistan 2016 blasting Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella.\u201d They are clearly friends, and more concerned with the music coming through loudly than enemy fire. Merit (Natalie Morales) tells Zoe (Sonequa Martin-Green) that they ever set foot in \u201csome dopy group therapy,\" to please kill her.",
      "Cut to years later, they\u2019re sitting in a counseling meeting for veterans and Morales\u2019 character has a sour look at her face. She turns to her friend: \u201cDid we survive the dumbest war of all time just to sit here all broken and kumbaya and ouchie-my-feelings?\u201d",
      "But after this rush of cavalier soldiering and bitter sarcasm comes a sobering moment. Merit blinks her eyes and is instead staring at an empty chair. Zoe isn\u2019t there at all.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d co-starring Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow. It comes from a real place, and you can tell. Hausmann-Stoke is himself a veteran and \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is dedicated to a pair of his platoon mates who committed suicide. The opening titles note the film was \u201cinspired by a true story.\u201d",
      "Audience disinterest has characterized many, though not all, of the films about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the output has pretty much dried up over the years. \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d feels like it was made with an awareness of that trend and as a rebuke to it.",
      "This is an often breezy and funny movie for what, on paper, is a difficult and dark story. But the comic tone of \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is, itself, a spirited rejection to not just the heaviness of many films about veterans but of the grief that can consume those who have dealt with loss and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Throughout the film, Zoe appears only to Merit, ala Brad Pitt in \u201cFight Club,\u201d singing alongside her as she drives or impatiently waiting for Merit to come home from a run. Whether this, following some unspecified end to Zoe, is a healthy thing or not for Merit is increasingly in doubt. Merit needs to cling to her friend, or her memory of her. But Zoe also rolls her eyes at any suggestion of talking through her feelings. Zoe, as an apparition, is both the cause and relief to her pain.",
      "There are a few other points of view, courtesy of two of our finest actors. Freeman plays the counselor of Merit\u2019s mandatory group sessions. He refuses to let Zoe coast. To pressure her to share and participate, he threatens withholding Zoe's certification.",
      "Meanwhile, Merit\u2019s grandfather, Dale (Harris), a Vietnam vet, has just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s. Merit is tasked with keeping an eye on him at his rural lakeside cabin and helping him into a retirement community \u2014 a prospect that infuriates him. As Merit\u2019s original inspiration for joining the army, Dale \u2014 stubborn and tight-lipped \u2014 epitomizes an earlier generation of soldier.",
      "In toggling between the present and wartime flashbacks, \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is sometimes a bumpy ride. The interplay between Merit and Zoe also shifts, beginning more like a buddy comedy and veering toward horror-film haunting, especially when Merit hesitantly agrees to a date with a worker at the prospective retirement home (Utkarsh Ambudkar).",
      "But the movie\u2019s earnestness carries it through these less smooth moments. So does the cast. Any opportunity to see Freeman or Harris, still at the top of their games, is a chance to be treasured. Freeman is typically sage and Harris characteristically fiery. But the leads are even better. Morales is at her finest as a cynical soldier, devoted to her friend but little else. And with compelling poise, Martin-Green (\"The Walking Dead\") carries a movie that at times can feel scattershot but never not sincere.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 101 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "In its brief morning update Saturday, the Vatican said: \u201cThe night has passed quietly, the pope is resting.\"",
      "In the late Friday update, the Vatican said the 88-year-old suffered an \u201cisolated crisis of bronchial spasm,\u201d a coughing fit in which Francis inhaled vomit, that resulted in a \u201csudden worsening of the respiratory picture.\u201d Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on non-invasive mechanical ventilation.",
      "The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the maneuvers to help him recover. He responded well, with a good level of oxygen exchange and was continuing to wear a mask to receive supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said.",
      "The episode, which occurred in the early afternoon, marked a setback in what had been two successive days of increasingly upbeat reports from doctors treating Francis at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "The Vatican said the episode was different to the prolonged respiratory crisis on Feb. 22, in that it was an isolated spasm that resulted in Francis aspirating the vomit that he produced.",
      "Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episode as relayed by the Vatican was alarming and underscored Francis\u2019 fragility and that his condition \u201ccan turn very quickly.\u201d",

      "\u201cSo given his age and his fragile state and his previous lung resection, this is very concerning,\u201d added Coleman, who is not involved in Francis\u2019 care.",

      "\u201cOften we will use noninvasive ventilation as a way of trying to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation,\u201d Feldman said.",
      "Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient\u2019s blood gas levels improve so they can eventually go back to using oxygen alone.",
      "Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in \u201ccritical condition,\u201d which has been absent from their statements for three days now. But they say he isn\u2019t out of danger, given the complexity of his case.",

      "The party features a band of saxophones, trombones and drums trailed by a truckload of speakers to spread their sound far and wide. And the choreographed dancers, \u201cthe jaguarettes,\u201d crawl about and paw playfully like large felines, with elaborate make-up to match.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a space that allows us to express a lot of artistry,\u201d said dancer Dandara Abreu, 36. \u201cIt allows our freedom of expression.\u201d",

He\u2019s going to be in charge of the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Momo\u2019s tenure is symbolic of society being turned upside down during Carnival. His role is inspired by Greek mythology. Momus is the personification of satire, mockery and irreverence."

    "story": [
      "Argentina\u2019s libertarian president Javier Milei has signaled that a new and much-anticipated deal with the International Monetary Fund is imminent",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina\u2019s libertarian president Javier Milei signaled late Saturday that a new deal with the International Monetary Fund was imminent, as he used his annual address to congress to project an optimistic picture of his economic overhaul following a divisive first year in office and recent swirl of controversies.",
      "In a speech that played to the sentiments of his right-wing base but included little in the way of new policy, Milei promised the crisis-stricken nation that, in the coming days, he would \u201cask congress to support the government in this new agreement with the International Monetary Fund\" even as it seemed Argentina had yet to close the deal.",
      "Revisiting the economic themes of his 2023 presidential campaign ahead of crucial midterm elections in October, Milei declared: \u201cWe went from talking about hyperinflation to talking about long-term stability.\u201d",
      "He cited his standard refrain about the government\u2019s success in dragging down the monthly inflation rate from a peak of 26% in December 2023, when he entered office, to just over 2% in January, and in helping the country claw its way out of a painful recession.",
      "\u201cWe have gone from being a global laughing stock ... to being an unexpected protagonist,\u201d Milei said.",
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who waved a chainsaw gifted by Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week in Washington, has cited the Argentine president\u2019s approach as inspiration for his own rampage through American federal bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cThe eyes of the world are now on Argentina after a long time,\u201d he said. \u201dAs is the case of Elon.\"",
      "On trade policy, Milei announced Argentina would leave the Mercosur bloc of South American nations if needed to clinch a free trade agreement with the United States.",
      "It marked Milei's latest effort to align his nation with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration at the expense of Argentina\u2019s previous allies and regional partnerships.",
      "\u201cTo take advantage of this historic opportunity, we must be willing to make things more flexible or even, if necessary, to leave Mercosur,\u201d he said.",
      "In his speech, Milei gave no further details about the supposed new financing deal with the Washington-based lender \u2014 a program his government has sought for months in order to help lift Argentina's strict capital and currency controls in hopes of reaping the benefits his free-market reforms, which, in 2024, delivered Argentina\u2019s first fiscal surplus in 14 years.",
      "Milei said his government would use a cash infusion from the IMF to replenish the central bank\u2019s diminished hard currency reserves, helping prevent a possible run on the peso as Argentina attempts to lift its complex web of capital controls before the year's end.",
      "\u201cThis new agreement will give us the tools to pave the way toward a freer and more efficient exchange rate system for all our citizens, to attract greater investments that will translate into lower inflation, greater growth and employment levels,\u201d Milei told congress.",
      "Foreign companies consider the notorious currency controls, which set an official exchange rate and restrict access to dollars in Argentina, to be the greatest impediment to investing in Argentina.",
      "The IMF, encouraged by Milei\u2019s progress but wary about the sustainability of his austerity, has been weighing whether to lend more money to troubled Argentina, its largest debtor with a history of defaults that still owes over $40 billon for its most recent program that ended in December.",
      "The fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While Milei's speech couched his successes as wins for the Argentine people, a boycott by members of Argentina\u2019s left-leaning opposition Peronist party, Uni\u00f3n por la Patria, left the typically packed legislative chamber half-empty.",
      "The Peronist bloc controls 46% of seats in the senate and 39% in the lower house \u2014 compared with just 10% and 15% respectively for Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza party.",
      "That Milei\u2019s political opponents remain hostile is no surprise, experts say, as the president pushes at the generally understood limits of executive power to steer around congress.",
      "The irascible former rocker and TV personality has brought a softer tone to his negotiations with lawmakers in recent months, borrowing some votes from the former center-right government of Mauricio Macri to ensure the passage of some key initiatives.",
      "But Milei has largely relied on decrees and other executive powers to deregulate industries, dissolve ministries, lay off over 40,000 public employees, eliminate public works projects, slash inflation adjustments for pensions and wages and curb the powers of trade unions, among other changes.",
      "\u201cHe showed that he can govern the country without congress,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n Menescaldi, an economist with the Buenos Aires consultancy firm EcoGo.",
      "Last week, Milei inflamed the political opposition by announcing he would bypass the country\u2019s senate to appoint two Supreme Court justice nominees by decree \u2014 one of whom has triggered backlash over accusations of money laundering and illicit enrichment.",
      "The appointments were widely criticized an overreach of executive authority that would ensure favorable rulings on his sweeping reforms whose constitutionality has been questioned in federal courts.",
      "As tensions rise between the government and lawmakers, midterm elections in October 2025 will prove crucial. A good result in the ballot would allow Milei \u201cto make all the changes he wants and not have to make any concessions,\" said Menescaldi, warning, \u201cThat could mean he becomes more authoritarian.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, the far-right economist has confronted the biggest crisis in his 14-month-old administration after promoting an unknown cryptocurrency token that shot up after his endorsement and rapidly cratered, prompting dozens of criminal complaints and calls for his impeachment.",
      "Federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible fraud and abuse of authority.",
      "Milei made no mention of the crypto scandal during his speech Saturday, which lasted over an hour."

      "Pope Francis is resting as he continues his recovery from double pneumonia",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis was in stable condition and resting on Sunday as he continued his recovery from double pneumonia, but again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance.",
      "For the third weekend in a row, Francis cancelled the appointment delivering the Angelus prayer. He could have delivered it from his 10th floor hospital suite at the Gemelli hospital if he were well enough.",
      "Instead, the Vatican planned to distribute the prepared text as Francis continued his recovery.",
      "\u201cThe night was quiet, the pope is still resting,\u201d the Vatican said in its Sunday update.",
      "He had no fever or signs of elevated white blood cells, which would signal his body was still fighting an infection.",
      "Doctors on Saturday reported that Francis was in stable condition, with no mention of him being critical, and signaled once again continued improvement. Their upbeat assessment came a day after a respiratory crisis that resulted in him being put on noninvasive mechanical ventilation.",
      "The 88-year-old pope though had a \u201cgood response\u201d in his gas exchange levels even during the \u201clong periods\u201d he was off the ventilator mask and only using high-flow supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said.",
      "The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "The fact that Francis was able to use just high-flow oxygen for long periods, without any significant effect on the levels of oxygen in his blood, was a sign his respiratory function was improving.",
      "Doctors were cautious however and kept his prognosis as guarded, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger. He was eating and drinking and continued his respiratory physiotherapy, and spent 20 minutes in his private chapel down the hall on Saturday, the Vatican said.",
      "Francis\u2019 hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking its Holy Year, drawing pilgrims to Rome from all over. They are walking through the Holy Door at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and also making pilgrimages to the hilltop Umbrian town of Assisi, to pray at the home of Francis\u2019 namesake, St. Francis.",
      "\u201cEvery day we\u2019re praying for the pope,\u201d said the Rev. Jacinto Bento, a priest visiting Assisi on Saturday with a group of 30 Jubilee pilgrims from the Azores Islands. \u201cWe\u2019re very sad for his situation.\u201d",
      "In an odd coincidence, Francis was supposed to have presided Saturday over a Holy Year audience in the Vatican\u2019s auditorium for the staff of the Gemelli hospital and other healthcare workers. They came as planned and completed the pilgrimage, while Francis continued his recovery at the hospital.",
      "\u201cWe thought we would be able to meet him this morning in Paul VI Hall for the Jubilee Catechesis, but he surprised us by coming to us,\u201d said Monsignor Claudio Giuliodori, spiritual guide of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, of which Gemelli is a part.",
      "Giovanni Frisullo, a Gemelli neurologist, said the atmosphere at Gemelli was one of tension and prayer. \u201cThere is a situation of waiting but also of hope,\u201d he said.",

Turkey has yet to make a detailed response to the PKK's ceasefire announcement.",
      "\u201cWe do not trust them, they said the same things before, nothing has changed. Twelve years ago they said peace, peace, peace. Then there was a ceasefire and then we saw what happened,\u201d said Turkan Duman, 56, referring to a previous peace process that broke down in 2015.",

      "Each region in the vast archipelago nation of 17,000 islands has its own way to mark the start of Ramadan, when Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual intercourse from sunrise until sunset for the whole month.",
      "Even a tiny sip of water or a puff of smoke is enough to invalidate the fast. At night, family and friends gather and feast in a festive atmosphere.",
      "Religious Affairs Minister Nasaruddin Umar announced Friday that Ramadan will begin on Saturday after the sighting of the crescent moon was confirmed by Islamic astronomy observers in Indonesia's westernmost province of Aceh.",
      "Shortly after the announcement, mosques flooded with devotees offering evening prayers known as \u201ctarawih\u201d on the first eve of Ramadan. In Jakarta\u2019s Istiqlal Grand Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, tens of thousands of worshippers crammed together shoulder-to-shoulder.",
      "The fasting is aimed at bringing the faithful closer to God and reminding them of the suffering of the poor. Muslims are expected to strictly observe daily prayers and engage in heightened religious contemplation. They are also urged to refrain from gossip, fighting or cursing during the holy month.",
      "Samsul Anwar, his wife and their 8-year-old nephew were among hundreds of people taking part in a torchlight parade along the streets of their neighborhood in Tangerang, a city just outside the capital of Jakarta, on Wednesday after evening prayers.",
      "They carried torches, lit flares and played Islamic songs accompanied by the beat of rebana, the Arabic handheld percussion instrument, as they walked along the cramped streets of the densely populated neighborhood.",
      "\u201cEvery year we welcome Ramadan with a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation,\u201d said Anwar.",
      "Chinese Indonesian communities also participated in the parade by performing the vibrant \u201cbarongsai\u201d or \u201clion dance,\u201d a prominent part of Chinese New Year celebration, to the sound of drums and trumpets.",
      "The barongsai performance \u201cwas also held to show unity between the religious communities of Chinese and Muslim, aiming to increase religious tolerance,\u201d Anwar said.",
      "It\u2019s also an exciting time for business. Hotels, restaurants and cafes all prepare special Ramadan promotions, and shoppers flock to shopping centers for new clothes and home decorations for the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan.

      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",
      "\u201cCarnival brings a lot of jobs. Not only here, but everywhere,\u201d she said.",

      "President Irfaan Ali, in a televised address, said Guyana was hurriedly notifying all of its international allies, including the Trump administration, and had summoned Venezuela's ambassador in the capital, Georgetown, to lodge a formal protest.",
      "\u201cThis incursion is a matter of grave concern,\u201d Ali said. \u201cGuyana\u2019s maritime boundaries are recognized under international law. This is a serious development concerning our nation\u2019s maritime territory. We will not tolerate threats to territorial integrity.\u201d",

      "GUHARZE, Iraq -- Iraqi Kurdish villagers, displaced by fighting between Turkish forces and Kurdish militants that has played out for years in northern Iraq, are finally allowing themselves to hope they will soon be able to go home.",
      "Their hopes were raised after the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, on Saturday declared a ceasefire in the 40-year insurgency against the Turkish government, answering a call to disarm from earlier in the week by the group's leader, Abdullah Ocalan, imprisoned in Turkey since 1999.",
      "The truce \u2014 if implemented \u2014 could not only be a turning point in neighboring Turkey but could also bring much needed stability to the volatile region spanning the border between the two countries.",
      "In northern Iraq, Turkish forces have repeatedly launched blistering offensives over the past years, pummeling PKK fighters who have been hiding out in sanctuaries in Iraq's northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and have set up bases in the area. Scores of villages have been completely emptied of their residents.",

      "\u201cBecause of Turkish bombing, all of our farmlands and trees were burned,\u201d Qadir said.",

      "Small havens remained safe, like the new Barchi, with only about 150 houses and where villagers rely on sesame, walnuts and rice farming. But as the fighting dragged on, the conflict grew ever closer.",

      "There has long been a Vatican taboo against openly talking about a conclave when a pope is sick: It\u2019s considered gauche to speculate about the election of a new pope while the current one is fighting for his life",
      "VATICAN CITY -- There has long been a Vatican taboo against openly talking about a conclave when a pope is sick: It\u2019s considered gauche to speculate about the election of a new pope while the current one is fighting for his life. And that is certainly true as Pope Francis battles double pneumonia at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital.",
      "But the surprising success of \u201cConclave\u201d the film and momentum going into Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards have thrust the arcane rules, glorious ceremony and supreme drama of one of the Catholic Church\u2019s most solemn moments into popular culture, and put the Catholic hierarchy in something of a bind as it simultaneously prays for Francis.",
      "The film can\u2019t be dismissed as distasteful or blasphemous, since it treats the gravity of a papal election with respect and accurately portrays the ancient rituals and contemporary problems facing today\u2019s Catholic Church. Both the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano and the Avvenire daily of the Italian bishops conference gave \u201cConclave\u201d rave reviews.",
      "Granted, those reviews were published before Francis entered the hospital Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection that has taken him out of commission for the longest time of his 12-year papacy.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the newspapers would have published them after Francis\u2019 health took such a dire turn. That's even more the case since it's clear from the opening scenes in the Vatican's modern Santa Marta hotel where Francis lives that \u201cConclave's\u201d fictional dead pope is modeled after the real-life current one.",
      "But at the very least, the life-imitating-art coincidence of \u201cConclave\u201d the movie finding mass popular appeal at a time when the world's media has descended on Rome to monitor Francis' health has certainly piqued interest in what might happen in a real-life conclave.",
      "\u201cConclave,\u201d director Edward Berger\u2019s adaptation of the Robert Harris novel starring Ralph Fiennes as the dean of the College of Cardinals, has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It goes into Sunday\u2019s Oscars with a Bafta win for best picture and a SAG award for best ensemble.",
      "Harris is well aware of the sensitivity of the moment, and how the surreal turn of events of an ailing pope dovetailing with an Oscar campaign had made his book and the film relevant to say the least. But he is adamant against trying to milk the moment for publicity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been refusing all requests to talk about it and a future conclave because I think that\u2019s in extreme bad taste,\u201d Harris told The Associated Press. \u201cI really hope he\u2019s got some more years yet.\u201d",
      "Francis suffered a setback on Friday, after he inhaled vomit during a coughing fit and required non-invasive mechanical ventilation to breathe. Doctors said they need 24 to 48 hours to evaluate how and if the isolated episode affected his overall clinical condition, while keeping his prognosis guarded.",
      "All of which has made \u201cConclave\u201d the film a bit too close for comfort in more ways than one for anyone following Francis' plight and concerned about what it means for the Catholic Church.",
      "To recap: The film opens with the death of the pope and turns around the political maneuvering and manipulations behind the election of his successor. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Fiennes) is dean of the College of Cardinals, who must organize the conclave amid his own crisis of faith.",
      "With the future of the church weighing on him, he has to contend with secrets, scandals, smear campaigns and surprising twists, while ensuring the election's integrity.",
      "Massimo Faggioli, theologian at Villanova University, said the film was \u201csadly effective\u201d in illustrating the institutional instability that the Catholic Church is going through now, as well as the ease with which a single act or allegation of misconduct can ruin someone.",
      "\u201cThe main threats (are) now coming not from the outside (Napoleon, or Hitler, or secularization), but from the inside (especially the fear of another sexual scandal),\u201d he said.",
      "For sure Berger takes some creative liberties. Cardinal Lawrence, for example, would have been excommunicated two or possibly three times for his efforts to navigate the intrigue, given the ban on communications with the outside world during a conclave and canon laws governing the seal of the confessional and the sealing of the papal apartments after a pope has died.",
      "But this is Hollywood, and His Eminence can be forgiven.",
      "Avvenire, which hews to the Vatican establishment line, praised the film for its sumptuous beauty, twists of plot and \u201canything but trivial\u201d commentary about the current state of the church.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s face it: \u2018Conclave,\u2019 which takes us to the heart of one of the world\u2019s most mysterious and secret events, is a highly entertaining film, especially for an American audience that isn\u2019t terribly picky,\u201d Avvenire said on Dec. 20, when the film opened in Italian theaters and well before Francis got sick.",
      "Writing in the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano on Feb. 1, critic Alessandra Comazzi highlighted the short but critical turn played by Isabella Rossellini, as Sister Agnes.",
      "As a longtime critic for the La Stampa daily, Comazzi is well aware of the Vatican taboo of openly talking of a conclave. But in an interview, she said the film managed to treat a conclave as thriller without causing offense. She said the Vatican newspaper was only too happy to publish her rave.",
      "\u201cThe dean Lawrence has to govern the conclave and liberate it from these false prophets,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think also from the ecclesial and religious point of view, the director managed to do it in a very respectful way.\u201d",
      "That said, someone who has actually participated in a conclave gave the film something of a thumbs down.",
      "\u201cMy experience of being in at least one conclave was not that it was some sort of scene of political backroom plotting of how to get your candidate elected,\u201d Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the retired archbishop of Boston, wrote in a Feb. 7 blog post.",
      "O\u2019Malley voted in the 2013 conclave that elected Francis pope and is one of his closest allies. He said he and his brother cardinals were well aware that millions of Catholics were praying from afar \u201cso that the Holy Spirit would guide us in our deliberations.\"",
      "\u201cAnd, of course, at the moment when each cardinal votes, you take your ballot, stand in front of Michelangelo\u2019s image of Christ in the \u2018Last Judgment\u2019 and swear before God that you are going to vote for the person that you believe is God\u2019s will for the church,\" he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a much different experience than what they depicted in the movie,\" he wrote. \"For all its artistic and entertainment value, I don\u2019t think the movie is a good portrayal of the spiritual reality of what a conclave is.\u201d",

      "The shouting match that unfolded Friday in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping fend off, and conclude, Russia\u2019s three-year onslaught.",
      "Here's the latest:",

      "A senior Hamas official says no progress has been made in the latest round of talks on the second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas",
      "CAIRO -- The latest round of talks on the second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has made no progress so far, and it was unclear whether the talks would resume on Saturday, a senior Hamas official said.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Phase one expires on Saturday, but under the terms of the deal, fighting is not to resume while negotiations are underway on the second phase, which could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining living hostages returned home.",
      "Officials from Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on the second phase in Cairo, with the goal of bringing an end to the war with the return of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.",
      "Hamas did not attend the talks, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, told The Associated Press there had been \u201cno progress\u201d on finding a solution before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday.",
      "It was unclear whether those mediators were going to return to Cairo to resume talks on Saturday as has been expected, and Naim said he had \u201cno idea\u201d when negotiations might start again.",
      "Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7 2023 attack that left 1,200 dead in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say that more than half the dead have been women and children.",
      "The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January, with the aim of bringing an end to the war.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said that it \u201creaffirms its full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details\u201d and called on the international community to pressure Israel to \u201cimmediately proceed to the second phase without any delay or evasion.\u201d",
      "In addition to phase two of the ceasefire, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that mediators in the talks were \u201calso discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region.\u201d",
      "Hamas has rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire\u2019s first phase by 42 days, saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "The Israeli proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started on Saturday, in return for an additional hostage exchange, the Hamas member said.",
      "The U.N. food agency, the World Food Program, said in a post on social media on Saturday that it reached 1 million Palestinians across Gaza during the deal\u2019s first phase.",
      "The pause in fighting helped \u201crestoring distribution points, reopening bakeries, and expanding cash assistance,\u201d the agency said.",
      "\u201cThe ceasefire must hold,\u201d it said. \u201cThere can be no going back.\u201d",

      "Inspired by both the late German neoexpressionist dancer Pina Bausch\u2019s work and lifestyle, the collection previewed Saturday during Milan Fashion Week featured soft cashmere knitted into form-hugging long sheer dresses or bodysuit-and-legging combos, worn with playful furry flip flops.",
      "Shearling fur accented jackets and became panels on sheer dresses in a game of conceal and reveal. A big black faux fur was finished with a pair of glossy black leather bags belted at the hip. Leather and satin were draped to create new shapes in skirts and blouses.",
      "Menswear was strong on everyday looks, including monochrome cashmere suiting, argyle sweaters paired with leather trousers and weekend bags, and a fun fur zipped bomber.",
      "The collection of mostly neutral tones included pops of Ferragamo red as accents like gloves or almond-toe pumps but more dramatically as a feathery dress with a matching handbag, or a fringe-covered sheer number incorporating long-stem trailing poppies.",

      "A summit of European leaders to discuss Ukraine's defense has been overshadowed by the diplomatic row at the White House",
      "LONDON -- It was supposed to cap a week of whirlwind diplomacy advancing the prospect of peace in Ukraine.",
      "But a summit of European leaders on Sunday has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding by U.S. President Donald Trump of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday for being ungrateful for U.S. support. The London meeting has now taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally and shoring up the continent's defenses.",
      "\u201cThere's a real problem for European leaders to pick up the pieces and try and move forward,\u201d Peter Ricketts, the former British national security adviser, told BBC radio on Saturday. \"It\u2019s going to be a damage limitation exercise. It\u2019s going to have to be an exercise in where do we go from here?\u201d",
      "The meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old elegant mansion near Buckingham Palace, follows a charm offensive last week to engage with Trump at the White House to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is hosting the leaders of more than a dozen countries and other officials, said he is determined to find an end to Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to come together to ensure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that secures their sovereignty and security,\" Starmer said in advance. \u201cNow is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future.\u201d",
      "The summit will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania. The Turkish foreign minister, NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council will also attend.",
      "Zelenskyy received broad support from leaders across Europe after the White House fiasco, which was exceptional for featuring an attack on an ally \u2014 and because it was broadcast on live television.",
      "Starmer embraced Zelenskyy when he arrived Saturday for a private meeting \u2014 a day before a get-together had been scheduled before the summit.",
      "\u201cAs you heard from the cheers on the street outside, you have full backing across the United Kingdom,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take.\u201d",
      "Europe has been uneasy since Trump initiated direct peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been isolated by most Western leaders since invading Ukraine three years ago. The scramble to remain relevant and protect European interests as their once stalwart ally appeared to be cozying up to Putin was even more troubling when Trump called Zelenskyy a dictator and falsely said Ukraine started the war.",
      "Meetings in recent days had provided some hope \u2014 until Zelenskyy\u2019s visit to the White House.",
      "Visits to the Oval Office by French President Emmanuel Macron, who had declared his visit a \u201cturning point,\u201d and Starmer were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops.",
      "Within 12 hours of Starmer's return from Washington, the talk of peace seemed to collapse as Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy for challenging Trump's assertions that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be trusted.",
      "\u201cStarmer did an impressive job of asserting Europe\u2019s agency in the war on Ukraine and conveying to President Trump that Europe is willing and able to take a leading role in implementing any credible peace deal,\" said Rachel Ellehuus, director-general of Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. \u201cUnfortunately, Friday\u2019s White House meeting was a major step backward.\u201d",
      "Ukraine can no longer count on military or political support from the U.S. after Trump declared himself neutral in negotiations, Ellehuus said. She said Europe needs to step in and could release some 200 billion euros ($207 million) in seized Russian assets to help fund that effort.",
      "\u201cThe immediate goal of the meetings in London must be to keep Ukraine in the fight so it can negotiate from a maximum position of strength,\u201d she said.",
      "Starmer pledged this week to boost military spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027. Other European nations may follow suit.",
      "Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Saturday that Europe faces a historic test and has to care for itself. He said European countries have to increase their arms spending to reach at least 3% of GDP.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t increase our effort fast enough and let the aggressor dictate its conditions we won\u2019t end up well,\u201d he said.",
      "Macron, who said it was legitimate for the U.S. to shift its focus to dealing with China and Asia, also called for more defense spending as he called for unity among his neighbors.",
      "\u201cWe should have woken up earlier,\u201d Macron said. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for years that we need a more sovereign, more united, more independent Europe.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "As Pope Francis remains hospitalized, a group of migrant transgender women are praying for his recovery",
      "TORVAIANICA, Italy -- Moira Camila Garnica and a group of fellow migrant transgender women have been gathering at their parish church to pray for Pope Francis as he continues to battle pneumonia in a Rome hospital, about an hour away from this modest seaside town.",
      "Many grew up Catholic in Argentina like Francis, and their prayers encompass gratitude for his outreach \u2013 several met him in person \u2013 as well as hope that\u202fthe door he opened toward a doubly marginalized community\u202fwill not be shut in the future.",
      "\u201cThe biggest fear is that you never know how things will be in the future, should he no longer lead the church, that it might go backwards,\u201d said Garnica, 47. \u201cWe hope that the church will continue with this empathy, continue to be open to everyone, continue to help, because sometimes one person can take a big step forward and then others take three steps back.\u201d",
      "Garnica and several other Latin American women, most sex workers who have been in Italy for a couple of decades, gathered for evening Mass in late February at the Blessed Immaculate Virgin Church. It was here they found food, medicine and basic financial assistance when\u202f Italy\u2019s strict COVID-19 lockdown rendered them unable to work, isolated and destitute.",
      "The parish priest, the Rev. Andrea Conocchia, invited them to write letters to Francis outlining their needs. The Vatican\u2019s almoner office not only provided money but brought a few dozen of them to the Vatican for vaccines. Years later, some were invited to a lunch for the poor with the pope.",
      "\u201cIn this Covid period, it was important that Pope Francis got inside the mind of transgender women, in the mind of the human beings that we are, and started to treat us like human beings, and that I think is the moment when faith or Christianity could embrace us,\u201d said Carla Segovia.",
      "The 48-year-old woman, of Indigenous Bolivian descent, left her native Argentina as a college student during its financial crisis more than 20 years ago. She has been working as a prostitute since she started to pay for her gender surgeries as a youth, and calls the violence and discrimination she has faced a tough test of \u201cyour potential to survive.\u201d",
      "Now that Francis is ill, she said she wants to \u201ctransmit to him our strength, the same thing that he brought to us in the difficult time of the pandemic. We want to inoculate him with this strength that is so crucial \u2013 the fact that you need to fight for your life.\u201d",
      "Gender transition is a\u202f controversial issue in many countries including the United States, where Catholic bishops reject it, and\u202f immigration is also roiling politics \u202fon both sides of the Atlantic. But Francis has made inclusion a hallmark of his papacy; specifically, the Vatican has stated it\u2019s permissible, under certain circumstances,\u202f for trans people to be baptized as Catholics \u202fand serve as godparents.",
      "Segovia and other women in their community were involved in the church as children but later felt their identity and work pushed them away \u2013 until they came to the Torvaianica parish\u2019s food distribution site, during the pandemic lockdown.",
      "\u201cWe Latin Americans are very Catholic, but being trans, many doors close, and people walk away from us, and we walk away too,\u201d Garnica said. \u201cThe word-of-mouth was that this church welcomed you, helped you, and I came to ask for help because I felt so alone.\u201d",
      "So did Minerva, a Peruvian 54-year-old who asked only her professional name be used, her voice shaking with emotion as she recounted how the experience changed her life in town.",
      "\u201cWe had no work, we had no money to buy food. A friend through word of mouth told me, go to the parish and knock, ask for Father Andrea. I came, I knocked, and like never before he opened his arms, he provided a support so big that still today he\u2019s helping us,\u201d Minerva said.",
      "\u201cHe opened for us so many doors. At the beginning even here people didn\u2019t pay attention to us. Now, when they see us, they greet us.\u201d",
      "For the Rev. Conocchia, helping this group of women is perfectly in line with the model of an open church reaching out to the margins that Francis has promoted, as well as the pope\u2019s famous \u201c who am I to judge\u201d \u202fapproach to LGBTQ+ issues.",
      "\u201cWe put the poor back at the center, we put people back at the center, and that\u2019s the Gospel,\u201d Conocchia said. \u201cWhat matters to me is a person, a person\u2019s life and their story \u2026 a person is never what they do.\u201d",
      "He said the Vatican\u2019s more open attitude, as well as its concrete welcome for this group of women, can help abolish prejudices that religious people hold \u2013 since it\u2019s possible the women\u2019s clients might include people who attend Mass, he wryly noted.",
      "For the women, who often are rejected by their own families, it\u2019s a moment of grace that went straight to the heart.",
      "\u201cA trans girl would have never imagined in her life that she could see the pope receive her, welcome her, and help her,\u201d Garnica said. \u201cAlready here people mistreat you for being Latin American, imagine Latin America and trans. \u2026 But thanks to Father Andrea, people understood that we also have a heart, we also can contribute, we need the church, too.\u201d",
      "Minerva was a First Communion catechist in her parish in Peru, until she said she was kicked out for her identity. In the Torvaianica sacristy, under a picture of Francis, she practiced singing a Spanish-language version of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d in hopes of joining the local choir. One verse, that she likes to sing to Mary, is about coming out of the shadows and into the light.",
      "\u201cI am church \u2013 not part of the church, I am church because each one of us is church,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "For Palestinians observing Ramadan in Gaza, the Muslim holy month started this year under a fragile ceasefire agreement that paused more than 15 months of the Israel-Hamas war",
      "JABALIYA, Gaza Strip -- Before the war, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was a festive time of increased worship, social gatherings and cheer for Fatima Al-Absi. Together with her husband, the resident of Jabaliya in Gaza said she used to do Ramadan shopping, visit relatives and head to the mosque for prayers.",
      "But the Israel-Hamas war has shredded many of the familiar and cherished threads of Ramadan as Al-Absi once knew it: her husband and a son-in-law have been killed, her home was damaged and burnt and the mosque she attended during Ramadan destroyed, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything has changed,\u201d she said on Saturday as her family observed the first day of Ramadan. \u201cThere\u2019s no husband, no home, no proper food and no proper life.\u201d",
      "For Al-Absi and other Gaza residents, Ramadan started this year under a fragile ceasefire agreement that paused more than 15 months of a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and devastated the Gaza Strip. Compared to last Ramadan, many found relief in the truce \u2014 but there's also worry and fear about what\u2019s next and grief over the personal and collective losses, the raw wounds and the numerous scars left behind.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot,\u201d said the 57-year-old grandmother, who\u2019s been reduced to eking out an existence amid the wreckage. \u201cLife is difficult. May God grant us patience and strength,\" she added.",
      "Israel\u2019s government said early Sunday it supports a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza through Ramadan and Passover even as Hamas has insisted earlier on negotiating the truce\u2019s second phase. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office came minutes after the first phase ended, and as talks have begun on starting the second phase.",
      "The statement gave new details on what Israel described as a U.S. proposal, which it said was made after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff got \u201cthe impression that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d,",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re scared because there's no stability,\" Al-Absi said and added that she\u2019s praying for the war to end and that she can\u2019t bear any more losses. She spoke before Israel\u2019s statement.",
      "Though Ramadan is still far from normal, some in the Gaza Strip said that, in some ways, it feels better than last year\u2019s.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t predict what will happen next,\u201d Amal Abu Sariyah, in Gaza City, said before the month\u2019s start. \u201cYes, the country is destroyed and the situation is very bad, but the feeling that the shelling and the killing ... have stopped, makes you (feel) that this year is better than the last one.\u201d",
      "Overshadowed by war and displacement, last Ramadan, was \u201cvery bad,\u201d for the Palestinian people, she said. The 2024 Ramadan in Gaza began with cease-fire talks then at a standstill, hunger worsening across the strip and no end in sight to the war.",
      "The war was sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel in which Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Vast areas of Gaza have been destroyed.",
      "Under the ceasefire, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza. After initial relief and joy at returning to their homes \u2014 even if damaged or destroyed \u2014 they\u2019ve been grappling with living amid the wreckage.",
      "As Palestinians in the Gaza Strip prepared for Ramadan, shopping for essential household goods and food, some lamented harsh living conditions and economic hardships, but also said they rely on their faith in God to provide for them.",
      "\u201cI used to help people. ... Today, I can\u2019t help myself,\u201d said Nasser Shoueikh. \u201cMy situation, thank God, used to be better and I wasn\u2019t in need for anything. ... We ask God to stand by us.\"",
      "For observant Muslims the world over, Ramadan is a time for fasting daily from dawn to sunset, increased worship, religious reflection, charity and good deeds. Socially, it often brings families and friends together in festive gatherings around meals to break their fast.",
      "Elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, Fatima Barbakh, from the southern city of Khan Younis, said her Ramadan shopping was limited to the essentials.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t buy lanterns or decorations like we do every Ramadan,\u201d she said.",
      "Back in Jabaliya, Al-Absi bitterly recalled how she used to break her fast with her husband, how much she misses him and how she remembers him when she prays.",
      "\u201cWe don't want war,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want peace and safety.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A U.S. aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea on Sunday in a show of force, days after North Korea test-launched cruise missiles to demonstrate its counterattack capabilities.",
      "The arrival of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group at the South Korean port of Busan was meant to display a solid U.S-South Korean military alliance in the face of persistent North Korean threats, and boost interoperability of the allies\u2019 combined assets, the South Korean navy said in a statement.",
      "It said it was the first U.S. aircraft carrier to travel to South Korea since June.",
      "The deployment of the carrier is expected to infuriate North Korea, which views temporary deployments of such powerful U.S. military assets as major security threats. North Korea has responded to some of the past deployments of U.S. aircraft carriers, long-range bombers and nuclear-powered submarines with missile tests.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump has said he will reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again to revive diplomacy. North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s overture but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "North Korea said Friday it test-fired strategic cruise missiles earlier last week to inform its adversaries of its military\u2019s counterattack capability and the readiness of its nuclear operations. After watching the launches, the North's fourth missile testing event this year, Kim ordered his military to be fully ready to use its nuclear weapons.",
      "Experts say Kim won\u2019t likely accept Trump\u2019s overture anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine with provision of weapons and troops. They say Kim could consider resuming diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country's current booming cooperation with Russia",
      "Kim and Trump met three times from 2018-19 during Trump\u2019s first term to discuss the future of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.",

      "Peskov spoke on Wednesday, before the Zelenskyy-Trump blowout on Friday.",
      "His remarks were seen as a follow-up on the U.S. splitting with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. In the U.N.

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran\u2019s parliament on Sunday impeached the country\u2019s economy minister and voted to remove him from office, amid growing concerns over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement.",
      "Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf announced that 182 out of 273 lawmakers voted to dismiss Abdolnasser Hemmati, just six months after President Masoud Pezeshkian\u2019s government took office.",
      "Pezeshkian, who defended Hemmati, emphasized that the government is locked in a tough battle with the West. He called for greater unity and cooperation from Parliament to face these challenges.",
      "The decision comes amid rising tensions over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and worsening relations with the West. Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, especially after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. In 2015, the rial was worth 32,000 to the dollar, but by the time Pezeshkian took office in July, it had plummeted to 584,000 to the dollar. Recently, it dropped even further, with exchange shops in Tehran trading 930,000 rials for each dollar.",
      "During the impeachment proceedings, Mohammad Qasim Osmani, a lawmaker supporting Hemmati, argued that rising inflation and exchange rates were not the fault of the current government or Parliament. He pointed to the budget deficit left by the previous administration, which he said contributed to the economic instability. Osmani also cited recent geopolitical events as factors that undermined public confidence, causing many people to convert their savings into foreign currency, which in turn further devalued the rial.",
      "Hemmati acknowledged the tough economic climate during his five months in office, including a 10% reduction in inflation. However, he acknowledged that inflation remained high, standing at 35%. He assured lawmakers that his team was working hard to address the issue, but warned that the process would take time.",

    "story": [
      "The U.K. government has provided provisional approval to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government gave its provisional backing Thursday to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London if certain improvements were met, including on noise reduction \u2014 a move that has been met with incredulity from environmental campaigners.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a written statement that she was \"minded to approve\u201d the expansion, which would involve moderately moving Gatwick's northern standby runway used for planes to taxi or as a backup.",
      "The original Gatwick project, which was rejected but then revised by planning inspectors, means that the final approval may be delayed by nine months.",
      "Under the new plan, Gatwick will have to ensure at least 50% of passengers traveling to and from the airport do so by public transport and take steps to mitigate noise.",
      "Gatwick, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of London and serves more than 40 million passengers a year, is the country's busiest single-runway airport, and second-busiest overall behind London's Heathrow Airport.",
      "Under the plan, Gatwick will have to move the current emergency runway 12 meters (39 feet) north away from the main runway in order to meet international safety standards. That would allow it to be used for departures of narrow-bodied planes such as Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s.",
      "The project, which will be funded privately, is expected to cost 2.2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion), could be completed by the end of the decade, if construction begins later this year.",
      "The expansion would allow it to cater for another 100,000 flights a year, taking capacity up to more than 380,000. It's projected to create 14,000 new jobs and generate 1 billion pounds ($1.26 billion) in annual economic benefits to the country.",
      "Gatwick, which is majority-owned by France-based VINCI Airports, has until April 24 to formally respond to the new proposals, while Alexander is expected to make a final decision shortly after that date, although a deadline has been extended to Oct. 27.",

      "A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source.",
      "That is not what many scientists and climate activists envisioned in the fight against climate change. And it is endangering progress on the greenhouse gas-reduction goals that scientists say are necessary to manage the damage from burning fossil fuels that warms the planet.",
      "Across the nation, tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking new power projects to feed their energy-hungry operations.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is building climate-friendlier projects like solar, wind, geothermal or battery storage.",
      "But industry decision-makers are also turning to natural gas for what they say is a cheap and reliable source of power, raising the prospect that gas-fired power will play a bigger role \u2014 and for a longer period of time \u2014 than even they had anticipated.",
      "\u201cGas is growing faster now and in the medium term than ever before,\u201d said Corianna Mah, a power and renewables analyst at data analytics firm Enverus.",
      "Before the spike in electricity demand last year, many in the industry had assumed that there would be few new gas plants and that the nation's fleet would gradually retire in favor of a grid powered by wind, solar, geothermal, batteries and possibly the next generation of nuclear power \u2014 sources that don't emit the planet-warming greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.",
      "For many countries, that ramp down is happening as they work toward the goal of slashing their emissions to zero \u2014 or at least, net zero \u2014 by 2050, which scientists say could help the world avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., the electric power sector is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to government figures. And the construction of every new natural gas plant \u2014 built to last for decades \u2014 is a setback for climate goals, said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.",
      "\u201cAt a top level, we will not get to net zero by 2050 if we are building new gas plants. Period,\u201d Quigley said.",
      "Burning natural gas emits carbon dioxide, and before that, when it escapes from wellheads or pipelines in its unburned form, it's an even more potent greenhouse gas called methane.",
      "Quigley and others say there is enough solar, wind and battery storage projects on the drawing board to satisfy growing electricity demand. But, they say, utilities and grid operators lack the will to abandon natural gas.",
      "Enverus now projects the next five years will bring roughly 46 gigawatts of gas-fired power online. That compares to 39 gigawatts in the past five years, it said.",
      "Announcements last year alone include:",
      "\u2014 two 705-megawatt plants by Evergy in Kansas;",
      "\u2014 Entergy's 2,300-megawatt plant to serve Meta\u2019s $10 billion AI data center in northern Louisiana, a pair of new plants in Texas and another in Mississippi;",
      "\u2014 a 1,450-megawatt plant by the Tennessee Valley Authority;",
      "\u2014 a 1,400 megawatt Duke Energy project in North Carolina;",
      "\u2014 and Georgia Power's plans for three oil or gas units with a capacity of up to 1,300 megawatts.",
      "And that\u2019s not all.",
      "Calpine said it's exploring new gas-fired capacity in the congested mid-Atlantic region, especially Pennsylvania and Ohio, where analysts say the grid operator is trying to fast-track new gas-fired power plants into service.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the former Homer City coal-fired power plant is being transformed into a massive gas-fired station that's expected to supply a data center \u2014 and got a $5 million state grant to do it.",
      "On top of the artificial intelligence boom, the frenzy for new electricity is fueled by cryptomining, the broader electrification of society and a bipartisan push to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "It is coinciding with the closure of coal plants and aging nuclear plants, unable to compete with cheaper gas, solar and wind.",
      "Across the U.S., gas pipeline operators are exuberant about the new demand and are reporting strong interest in extending their lines.",
      "Chris Kalnin, the CEO of BKV, the largest natural-gas producer in the Barnett Shale gas reservoir in Texas, said the trend there is toward gas plants being built next to data centers in a booming data center corridor in metropolitan Dallas.",
      "Data center developers there are in an \u201carms race\u201d to secure power, Kalnin said.",
      "\u201cData center guys are trying to source power and trying to get to market with their data centers as fast as possible,\" Kalnin said. The key to signing up cloud-computing customers \"is getting your facility online quickly and getting your facility online quickly requires you to have power and dependable power and a cost-efficient power source.\u201d",
      "Rob Jennings of the American Petroleum Institute, said the sudden growth in actual and forecast electricity demand has put a premium on power sources that can be built fast and cheaply and are reliable.",
      "That means natural gas is once again attractive to investors over solar and wind, he said.",
      "\u201cIn the near term, the reality has dawned on most that it has to be gas,\u201d Jennings said.",
      "Industry officials say they strive to deliver electricity that is clean, reliable and affordable.",
      "For instance, some new gas plants are replacing higher-pollution coal-fired plants, some are designed to run only at times of high demand, some are paired with battery storage or a wind farm nearby and some are designed with carbon-capture technology or to run on a hydrogen blend, said Alex Bond of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents U.S. investor-owned electric companies.",
      "At the very least, building gas-fired capacity will have high-level political support.",
      "In his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, President Donald Trump declared that he'd issue \u201cemergency declarations\u201d to get coal - and gas-plants built to make the U.S. a superpower of manufacturing, cryptomining and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Amanda Levin of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the U.S. must take big steps by 2035 to reduce its reliance on gas.",
      "That means slashing a fleet of roughly 1,500 gas plants down to about 100 if the U.S. is to meet strong climate commitments and preserve a chance of addressing climate change, she said.",
      "Still, she said there are reasons to be optimistic that gas plant projects on the drawing board won\u2019t get built.",
      "In recent weeks, Chinese tech startup Deepseek released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies and at a fraction of the cost \u2014 calling into question the need for a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers.",
      "And some analysts believe utilities overestimate the electricity they\u2019ll need, essentially by double- or triple-counting data center proposals when firms express interest in multiple locations \u2014 but only build in one.",
      "Besides, Levin said, data center operators are getting better at energy efficiency, particularly in how they cool their servers.",
      "Even if all the gas plants are built, they may not get used, she said.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of reasons,\u201d Levin said, \"for why we might not actually see all of this (demand) materialize.\u201d",

      "Vietnam is revising its energy plans to focus more on large solar farms and less on reliance on coal and natural gas",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam is revising its energy plans to focus more on large solar farms and less on reliance on coal and natural gas. The fast-growing economy now aims to get 16% of its energy from the sun \u2014 more than triple its earlier target of just 5%.",
      "A draft of the new policy outline, likely to be finalized in coming weeks, scraps plans to build offshore wind turbines, instead building more onshore wind capacity, rooftop solar and energy storage.",
      "Offshore wind and new gas projects have proven expensive and difficult. Large solar farms are cheaper and easier to build.",
      "But Vietnam also is emphasizing expansion of large solar farms to meet soaring demand for power generation. It forecasts it will need more than 211 gigawatts of energy by 2030 as its economy grows, 40% more than its previous estimate and more than Germany's current total capacity.",
      "\u201cThis reflects both an overall increase in potential power demand by 2030 and the fact that LNG (or liquefied natural gas) projects are not on track to be completed by 2030,\u201d said Giles Cooper, a partner at the international law firm Allens based in Hanoi who specializes in energy policy.",
      "Solar power expanded rapidly in Vietnam from 2018 to 2020, helped by generous government policies, as it leaped past its neighbors and some richer nations like the United Kingdom. But construction of new solar capacity stalled in 2020 as the Southeast Asian nation realized that its creaky electricity grid was getting overloaded since electricity was only available when the sun shone.",
      "\u201cIt was like the market almost stopped,\u201d said Dimitri Pescia, of Berlin-based thinktank Agora Energiewende.",
      "Use of polluting coal, which releases earth-warming gases into the atmosphere, has surged and Vietnam is set to become of the world's top five coal importers, displacing Taiwan, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Like many other countries, Vietnam still needs to upgrade its rickety grid, which has failed to keep up with rapid growth of clean power generation. However, it has made improvements and gained experience dealing with energy sources that aren\u2019t always availables, Cooper said.",
      "Last year, authorities allowed electricity-guzzling factories to buy power directly from energy producers, aiming to ease pressure on the overstrained power grid and help big manufacturers like Samsung Electronics meet their climate targets. But that was hindered by a lack of space to build clean energy projects close to factories.",
      "Solar energy is \u201cseen as the most promising technology to kick start\u201d those direct purchases, Cooper said.",
      "But while it's building clean power capacity, Vietnam is also ramping up use of coal. That's partly to make up for lost hydropower capacity due to drought, and also to meet soaring demand as businesses shift factories from China to Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam is Southeast Asia's second-biggest coal producer after Indonesia. It also imported 50 million ton of coal in the first three quarters of 2024 \u2014 a 31% increase, according to government data.",
      "Pescia noted that Vietnam\u2019s coal-fired power plants aren\u2019t very old and operators have yet to recoup their investments.",

      "Projections show Ontario Premier Doug Ford won reelection to lead Canada\u2019s most populous province, giving him the mandate he wanted to fight tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump",
      "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Ontario Premier Doug Ford won reelection to lead Canada's most populous province Thursday, giving him the mandate he wanted to fight tariffs threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI am very grateful to the people of Ontario,\u201d Ford told CTV News afterward. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we will protect the people of Ontario and protect their families, their jobs and businesses. I\u2019ll fight tooth and nail against Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "Unofficial results from Elections Ontario showed Ford's Progressive Conservative Party would win a majority government, giving him his third term as premier.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal Party will choose a new leader March 9, congratulated Ford on his victory.",
      "Ford called the election on Jan. 29, more than a year early. The Conservatives already held a majority with 79 seats.",
      "He said at the time he needed a four-year mandate to protect Ontario, Canada\u2019s manufacturing and automobile hub.",
      "Trump has threatened to implement 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports, with a lower 10% levy on energy, beginning Tuesday. He also has angered Canadians by talking about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state.",
      "During the campaign Ford made two trips to Washington to speak to U.S. government and business leaders about the tariffs.",
      "Ford has said his government is prepared to spend \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d to protect jobs and the economy of Ontario, and he has mused about making Americans pay more for the electricity Ontario sends to the U.S.",
      "Opposition parties accuse Ford of calling an early election before any potential charges emerge from a police investigation into his now-scrapped plan to develop lands under environmental protection.",
      "They also said the cost of the election could have been better spent on health care and affordable housing.",
      "Jonathan Malloy, a political scientist at Carleton University in Ottawa, said the tariff threats gave Ford the excuse he needed to call an early election.",
      "\u201cCanadians are concerned with the Trump tariffs,\" Malloy said. \"Mr. Ford is being seen as being out front, responding to them. That\u2019s politically advantageous for him.\u201d",
      "With a population of around 16 million, Ontario is the Canadian province with the most people and an economy that makes up 38% of Canadian GDP.",
      "During the campaign, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie promised to connect every Ontarian to a family doctor, and New Democratic Party Leader Marit Stiles addressed health care and affordability.",
      "Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner made promises about building more housing, protecting farmland and improving affordability.",
      "\u201cI think this had been a very low-profile election,\u201d said Malloy. \u201cWhen Canadians are asked about the number one public issue these days, I\u2019m sure they would say the Trump tariffs. That has overshadowed the election.\u201d",
      "When the election was called, the NDP had 28 seats, the Liberals had nine and the Greens had two. There were six independents. A majority government requires at least 63 seats.",
      "Unofficial results from Elections Ontario showed the Progressive Conservatives winning 79 seats, the NDP 25, the Liberals 14, the Greens two and one independent."

    "story": [
      "Athletes have long used sports as a forum for civil rights activism",
      "For WNBA veteran Natasha Cloud, speaking up about social justice is just as important as winning basketball games.",
      "Cloud has had a successful nine-year pro career that includes a WNBA championship and being the career-assists leader for her former Washington Mystics. She has also used her platform for social justice advocacy \u2014 from sitting out the 2020 WNBA season to focus on community reform efforts, to joining protests after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.",
      "If winning \u201cis all I do with my career, then I have failed,\u201d said Cloud, who now plays for the Connecticut Sun. \"Who would I be to not utilize practice time and camera time and all these things to create change within the communities that mean the most to me?\u201d",
      "Cloud believes it's more imperative than ever for athletes across American professional sports to speak out against racial discrimination in the face of President Donald Trump's sweeping orders to end government diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and as corporations and major institutions face pressure to roll back DEI policies aimed at creating opportunities for minority groups.",
      "\u201cThe systems of power are working as they always were intended to work,\" Cloud said. \"And it\u2019s time to break down a system that has only been about white men.\u201d",
      "Athletes have long used sports as a forum for civil rights activism, but today's sports figures have a unique position of influence, with more money and celebrity status than ever, and social media to get their message to millions.",
      "With that also comes the potential for backlash and retaliation. Speaking out could cost their reputations, their connections, their careers, experts say.",
      "It's a danger Black athletes have always faced, whether boxing great Muhammad Ali risking his freedom to take an anti-war stance in the 1960s, or more recently, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick putting his job on the line to denounce police brutality in Black communities.",
      "Black athletes who speak out for political or social change have often paid a price for their actions.",
      "\u201cOne of the most definitive characteristics of pursuit of social justice, particularly by athletes today, is the idea of sacrifice,\u201d said Len Elmore, a former NBA player and now a senior lecturer in sports management at Columbia University. \u201cThey have to be willing to sacrifice because the broad society for a period of time \u2014 as it did to those past heroes \u2014 is going to penalize you.\u201d",
      "With his attempt to abolish diversity and inclusion programs, Trump has sought to ban transgender athletes from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports and has directed schools and universities to eliminate diversity initiatives or risk losing federal money. That includes no longer teaching material dealing with race and sexuality \u2014 part of his effort to end \u201cwokeness\u201d in schools.",
      "Companies \u2014 including Target, Google, Walmart and McDonald's \u2014 have scaled back or set aside diversity initiatives endorsed by much of corporate America during a 2020 nationwide reckoning on race to help root out systemic barriers that have hindered the advancement of marginalized groups.",
      "\u201cOn a basic level, it\u2019s just a fight for human dignity and human rights,\u201d said Joseph N. Cooper, a professor of Counseling, School Psychology and Sport at the University of Massachusetts Boston.",
      "While he doesn't believe the weight of social justice reform should solely fall on the shoulders of Black athletes, Cooper said it's important for sports stars to leverage their visibility to champion causes they're passionate about.",
      "Cloud, who used her social media to call for WNBA arenas to serve as polling places for the 2020 presidential election and helped with voter registration, believes the NBA and WNBA \u2014where African American players are in the majority \u2014 should stand with the communities their players come from, as many feel the social and economic progress of Black Americans is in jeopardy.",
      "\u201cI understand the business aspect and I understand the human aspect,\u201d Cloud said. \"Too often this country has put the human aspect aside, and put profit and money over people.\u201d",
      "Both the NBA and WNBA featured the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d rallying cry on the courts in 2020 and partnered with players to find outlets for tangible social justice action. This included creating the NBA Foundation to spur economic growth in the Black community, with an initial contribution of $300 million over the next decade.",
      "Often individual players have taken the first bold steps in mixing sports and politics.",
      "During Trump's first administration, the NBA's LeBron James and Stephen Curry were among athletes who declined visits to the White House normally given to championship-winning teams.",
      "Curry and his wife Ayesha endorsed Joe Biden for president during the 2020 Democratic National Convention. James headlined the \u201cMore Than A Vote\u201d Campaign, formed soon after police shot and killed Floyd and Breonna Taylor, to target systemic voter suppression and encourage Black people to vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that their activism and decision to not go to the White House was a primary or even a major factor in the outcome of the 2020 election,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut no doubt, those athletes and athletes who have similar profiles as them leveraging their platform to promote freedom, human rights ... it's extremely powerful.\u201d",
      "Jaylen Brown of the NBA's Boston Celtics has more than 4.7 million followers across Instagram and X and for years has used his social media accounts to draw attention to social justice causes and boost small businesses.",
      "Brown marched with protesters in Minneapolis in the days after video was released of Floyd's May 2020 death. He created a foundation that partners with social justice organizations to create opportunities for youth in traditionally underserved communities.",
      "\u201cI use my platform to try to bring light to a lot of different things and situations to get people to think differently,\" Brown said. \u201cBut also to provide solutions.\u201d",
      "Elmore, who played in the American Basketball Association from 1974-1976 and with the NBA from 1976-1984 after the two leagues merged, said it's not incumbent on any athlete to pursue social justice just because they have a platform.",
      "\u201cBut, you know, it wasn\u2019t incumbent upon Ali,\" he said. \"It wasn\u2019t incumbent upon Colin Kaepernick. They did it because they recognized the righteousness of their actions. They recognized the need.\u201d",
      "Kaepernick, who led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2012, sacrificed his career.",
      "He has not played in the NFL since kneeling during the national anthem during the 2016 season, and became one of the most polarizing figures in modern sports. Fans urged boycotts of companies aligned with him. Trump denounced his actions and said he and any player who knelt during the anthem should be fired by the NFL.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s not lost on athletes today who are making an awful lot of money, gain a great deal of celebrity and adulation,\u201d Elmore said. \u201cWho really wants to lose that? Who wants to put that in jeopardy?",
      "\u201cIt takes a special type of person \u2014 a special group of people to be able to do that,\" he added. \u201cOr it takes a desperation. And the question is, are we at that desperate moment?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Congress sent to President Donald Trump's desk a repeal of a fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas production",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled Congress has voted to repeal a federal fee on oil and gas producers who release high levels of methane, undoing a major piece of former President Joe Biden's climate policy aimed at controlling the planet-warming \u201csuper pollutant.\" The fee, which had not gone into effect, was expected to bring in billions of dollars.",
      "The Senate on Thursday voted along party lines 52-47 to repeal the fee, following a similar House vote on Wednesday. The measure now goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.",
      "Methane is a much stronger global warming gas than carbon dioxide, especially in the short term, and is to blame for about one-third of the world\u2019s warming so far. Oil and gas producers are among the biggest U.S. methane emitters and controlling it is critical to address climate change.",
      "Most major oil and gas companies do not release enough methane to trigger the fee, which is $900 per ton, an amount that would increase to $1,500 by 2026. The measure was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but the Environmental Protection Agency didn\u2019t formally set rules until late last year.",
      "That timing made it vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to pass a resolution to undo rules that are finalized towards the end of a president's term. If those resolutions pass and the president signs them, the rule is terminated and agencies can\u2019t issue a similar one again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sorry testament to the influence of Big Oil on Capitol Hill that one of the top priorities of Congress is a blatant handout to the worst actors in the fossil fuel industry,\" said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen\u2019s energy program.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, the largest lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, applauded the move, calling the fee a \u201cduplicative, punitive tax on American energy production that stifles innovation.\"",
      "\u201cThanks to industry action, methane emissions continue to decline as production increases, and we support building on this progress through smart and effective regulation,\u201d said Amanda Eversole, the executive vice president and chief advocacy officer at API.",
      "Globally, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have been steadily climbing.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who chairs the Senate's Environment and Public Works committee, spoke in favor of repeal on the Senate floor.",
      "\u201cWe should be expanding natural gas production, not restricting it. Instead, the natural gas tax will constrain American natural gas production, leading to increased energy prices and providing a boost to the production of natural gas in Russia,\u201d she said.",
      "When gas leaks, the producer is wasting gas it could keep and sell.",
      "Repeal of the methane fee is the latest of several pro-oil and gas moves Republicans have taken since the start of Trump's term. On his first day, he declared a national energy emergency, calling for more oil and gas production, and fewer environmental reviews. Democrats failed to overturn that declaration yesterday. Trump has also lifted a pause on new applications for liquified natural gas export terminals, removed the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and moved to open up more areas of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling.",
      "The fee on methane releases was aimed at pushing companies to adopt better practices to curb emissions and make their operations more efficient. The EPA had said the fee was expected to reduce 1.2 million metric tons of methane emissions by 2035 \u2014 that\u2019s about the same as removing 8 million cars from the road for a year.",
      "The Biden administration had also implemented methane regulations on existing oil and gas wells, after addressing methane escaping from new wells. The EPA at the time meant for the fee to complement that rule and focus on the worst polluters.",

      "Rwanda-backed rebels captured a key eastern Congo city a month ago Friday",
      "GOMA, Congo -- GOMA, Congo (AP) \u2014 Rwanda-backed rebels captured a key eastern Congo city a month ago Friday. Residents in Goma, which was once a critical trade and humanitarian hub, say they are struggling on various fronts even as the rebels try to consolidate their administration and restart normal life.",
      "On the streets of Goma, which is close to the border with Rwanda, economic activities have largely slowed down since the M23 rebels took over on Jan. 28. Banks are still shut, basic services such as trade are slowly restarting and thousands displaced by the conflict are desperate for aid and temporary shelters.",
      "\u201cFinding food has become a real challenge,\u201d said Jeannette Safari, her face marked by exhaustion and fear.",
      "The 26-year-old mother of one is now making plans to flee to Burundi. Safari had been working as a civil servant, but with government offices still not running, making ends meet has been a struggle for thousands of government workers like her living where the M23 controls, she said.",
      "\u201cLife is cheaper there (in Burundi), and even though I don\u2019t know exactly how I\u2019ll manage, I\u2019ll make do,\u201d she said.",
      "The city and its environs had hosted more than 500,000 displaced people in addition to its population of 2 million, before the M23 rebels seized it last month in a major escalation of their yearslong fighting with government forces in the central African nation.",
      "With the support of around 4,000 troops from Rwanda, the rebels fought off overstretched and outnumbered Congolese forces \u2014 many of whom surrendered \u2014 and started to gain more territories, taking Bukavu, a second major city in the region. The expansion is unprecedented, unlike in 2012 when M23 captured Goma for days, and has raised the risks of regional warfare, analysts say.",
      "Although the rebels have agreed to talks that neighbors have pushed for, Congo's government accuses them of carrying out human rights abuses and using their campaign to advance the interests of Rwanda.",
      "The rebellion has meant that the devastated city, which used to be a key trade route, has struggled economically as schools and other social services haven't returned to normal levels.",
      "The M23 has tried to strengthen their grip on the city, pushing for social services like electricity and water supplies to return. But life is still far from normal, locals say, many of them living in fear and uncertainty about what could happen next.",
      "Roads that were once bustling with heavy traffic and shopping outlets are often deserted and heavily militarized with armed rebels at every corner.",
      "As the M23 advanced towards Goma in January, the number of residents fleeing to safety sharply grew from hundreds to thousands. By the time the city had fallen to the rebellion, hundreds of thousands of people who were already displaced by the conflict had fled once again, the U.N. said.",
      "Despite M23\u2019s promises to restart economic activities, commercial banks haven't resumed operations as the local branch of the Central Bank of Congo remains closed down.",
      "The bank closures have led to concerns that the rebels could seek alternative banking systems independent of the Congolese government\u2019s control, a major setback to regional efforts to get them to withdraw from the city.",
      "\u201cThe only solution to this crisis would be a rigorous management of available resources and the establishment of alternative financial structures such as microfinance institutions,\u201d said Deo Bengehya, a Goma-based professor of economic sciences.",
      "The prolonged suspension of banking activities could further weaken the local economy and squeeze the population, which is already struggling with job losses and price hikes, he added.",

      "The federal government says the owner of a North Carolina company has pleaded guilty to trying to sell electronic devices that have military applications to China without a required exporting license",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- The owner of a North Carolina company pleaded guilty in federal court on Friday to trying to sell electronic devices that have military applications to China without having a required U.S. government license, authorities said.",
      "David C. Bohmerwald, who was formally charged in October with violating the Export Control Reform Act and other portions of the federal code, entered the plea to a count before U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle in Raleigh. Bohmerwald, 63, has a tentative sentencing date for mid-May, court records show. He could face up to 20 years in prison, according to a U.S. Justice Department news release.",
      "Bohmerwald, the owner of Raleigh-based Components Cooper Inc., purchased 100 accelerometers from a U.S.-based electronic company, and then attempted to export the devices to a company in China, the release said, citing court documents and information presented in court.",
      "An accelerometer, which measures the vibration, tilt and acceleration of a structure, can be used in aerospace and military applications, such as helping missiles fly more accurately and measuring the precise effect of munitions.",
      "The electronics company notified law enforcement about Bohmerwald\u2019s purchase request. After receiving the accelerometers, Bohmerwald dropped off two parcels -- one addressed to a business in China -- at a shipping store, the release said. A federal agent held the package and found the 100 accelerometers inside.",
      "Bohmerwald falsely listed the value of the package\u2019s content at $100, when the true value was nearly $20,000, according to the government, and he admitted to agents that he acquired the technology on behalf of a Chinese-based company while knowing about the export restrictions.",
      "\u201cThe disruption of this scheme to illegally export sensitive technology means that accelerometers and other items will not be used by unauthorized individuals or for adversarial purposes,\u201d said Cardell Morant, a special agent in charge who supervises Homeland Security Investigations, within the Department of Homeland Security, in the Carolinas.",
      "Lawyers identified in court records as representing Bohmerwald in the case didn\u2019t respond Friday to an email seeking comment."

      "A federal judge in San Francisco finds the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful, granting temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration\u2019s massive dismantling of the federal workforce.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including the Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cOPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe,\u201d to hire or fire any employees but its own, Alsup said.",
      "The complaint filed by five labor unions and five nonprofit organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal workforce, which Trump has called bloated and sloppy. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and his administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service protection.",
      "Lawyers for the government agree that the office has no authority to hire or fire employees in other agencies.",
      "But they say the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for continued employment. They also say that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.",
      "Attorneys for the coalition cheered the order, although it does not mean that fired employees will automatically be rehired or that future firings will not occur.",
      "\u201cWhat it means in practical effects is the agencies of the federal government should hear the court\u2019s warning that that order was unlawful,\u201d said Danielle Leonard, an attorney for the coalition, after the hearing.",
      "Emails for comment to the Office of Personnel Management and the U.S. Department of Justice were not immediately returned Thursday.",
      "Alsup ordered the personnel office to inform a limited number of federal agencies represented by the five nonprofits that are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which include veterans, parks, small businesses and defense. He seemed particularly troubled by firings expected at the Department of Defense.",
      "He also ordered the acting head of the personnel office, Charles Ezell, to testify in court about the nature of a Feb. 13 phone call in which agency heads were told to fire probationary employees.",
      "\u201cThe agencies could thumb their noses at OPM if they wanted to if it\u2019s guidance, but if it\u2019s an order, or cast as an order, the agencies may think they have to comply,\u201d he said.",
      "There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers \u2014 generally employees who have less than a year on the job \u2014 across federal agencies. About 15,000 are employed in California, providing services ranging from fire prevention to veterans\u2019 care, the complaint says.",
      "Elon Musk has led the purge through the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, roiling the workforce with demands including a Saturday email sent through the personnel office ordering workers to list five things they did last week or risk getting fired. The Office of Personnel Management later said that the edict was voluntary, although workers could face similar requests in the future.",
      "The plaintiffs said in their complaint that numerous agencies informed workers that the personnel office had ordered the terminations, with an order to use a template e-mail informing workers their firing was for performance reasons.",
      "Probationary employees of the National Science Foundation, for example, were told by the foundation that it had decided to retain its workers but was overruled by the Office of Personnel Management, according to the complaint.",
      "Unions have recently struck out with two other federal judges.",
      "A judge in Washington, D.C., last week denied a motion from unions to temporarily block layoffs because he found their complaint should be heard in federal labor court. Earlier this month, a judge in Massachusetts said unions suing over a deferred resignation offer weren\u2019t directly affected and so lacked legal standing to challenge it.",
      "Alsup said labor unions likely lack legal standing to sue, but the nonprofit organizations likely have cause because their members will be denied government services resulting from the loss of workers, such as the enjoyment of parks, mental health services for veterans and loans for small businesses.",
      "He was appalled that probationary employees were fired with a mark against them for poor performance.",
      "\u201cProbationary employees are the lifeblood of our government,\u201d he said, adding that they are younger employees who work their way up.",
      "Alsup plans to issue a written order. An evidentiary hearing is set for March 13."

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Students in Bangladesh who led a mass uprising to topple former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last summer are now diving into politics by forming the new National Citizen Party.",
      "The aim is to create new political space in a fiercely divisive dynastic political landscape. For decades, the country\u2019s politics have been dominated by two former prime ministers and archrivals \u2014 Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.",
      "The announcement came Friday at a rally in front of Parliament in Dhaka, during which political reforms were promised for a country born in 1971 through a bloody war against Pakistan.",
      "Thousands of people, mainly youths, gathered to witness the moment. Critics of Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who heads the interim government, say the new party is nothing but a \u201cKing\u2019s Party\u201d blessed by him. But political analysts say the new platform might be able to break the decades-long traditional political power structure in the South Asian nation.",
      "The new party has been named the Jatiya Nagarik Party, or National Citizen Party.",
      "Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old prominent student leader, was named as the head of the party. Nine other officials \u2014 all of them student leaders who rose to prominence during the mass uprising in July and August \u2014 have been named to top positions, according to Bangladeshi media.",
      "A 151-member committee of the party was announced during the launch.",
      "Supporters say a party is needed to bring reforms to the country\u2019s political culture of nepotism, and to tackle corruption and lack of democratic practices.",
      "Islam announced that the party\u2019s mission is to dismantle \u201cconstitutional autocracy and adopt a new democratic constitution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must eliminate all possibilities of restoring constitutional autocracy. Now is the time to dream anew, to march forward, and to build a new Bangladesh,\u201d Islam said as he read out the declaration.",
      "He said that the mass uprising wasn't merely about ousting a government, but also about reshaping the entire political framework.",
      "The party is committed to fostering a political culture where \u201cunity prevails over division, justice replaces vengeance, and merit triumphs over dynastic politics,\u201d Islam said.",
      "The organizers said that they invited Yunus, his interim government\u2019s other advisers, heads of political parties, including Zia\u2019s Bangladesh Nationalist Party and others.",
      "Hasina\u2019s Awami League Party and its 13 other previous allies weren't invited to the launching ceremony. Yunus or other advisers from his interim Cabinet didn't attend the event. Foreign diplomats were also invited but diplomats from India and other major global powers weren't spotted at the rally.",
      "Islam and his colleagues have been campaigning for months for Hasina to be put on trial for hundreds of deaths during the July-August uprising. The student leaders involved in the new party have also talked fiercely against India, accusing the neighboring country of exhibiting hegemony over Bangladesh, drawing a sharp reaction from India.",
      "On Friday, a giant stage was installed on a major thoroughfare just in front of the Parliament building in Dhaka. The organizers said they expected up to 300,000 people during the party\u2019s launch. But witnesses said up to 50,000 attended the event.",
      "After the installation of the interim government, Yunus repeatedly said that he was appointed by the students who led the anti-Hasina uprising.",
      "It wasn't clear if Yunus had any direct role behind forming the new party, but many critics of Yunus said, mainly on social media, that the formation of the party is an effort to unveil a \u201cking\u2019s party.\u201d",
      "But Bangladeshi analyst Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah told The Associated Press: \u201cMost probably it\u2019s more than that.",
      "\u201cThey have an aspiration to connect young people who felt disconnected in a great way with the mainstream political forces like Hasina\u2019s Awami League party and Zia\u2019s Bangladesh Nationalist Party,\u201d he said. \"And, of course this new party has blessings from Muhammad Yunus.\u201d",
      "Kalimullah said the new party \u201cmost probably\u201d has \u201ca future.\u201d",
      "The new party is expected to seek registration with the country\u2019s Election Commission to participate in the next election, which is expected to be held either in December or by June 2026.",
      "The party will try to form an alliance with other parties except Zia\u2019s Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is hoping to form the next government. The new party\u2019s relationship with the Jamaat-e-Islami party remains unclear.",
      "Hasina\u2019s Bangladesh Awami League party is under tremendous pressure after she fled to India and thousands of party leaders and activists have either left the country, gone into hiding or have been arrested. The student wing of Hasina\u2019s party has already been banned by the Yunus-led government, which has been struggling to stabilize the country's law and order situation since the ouster of Hasina."

      "The European Union is insisting that the 27-nation bloc is not out to undermine the United States as U.S. President Donald Trump put it",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Thursday pushed back hard against allegations by U.S. President Donald Trump that the 27-nation bloc was out to get the United States, and warned that it would vigorously fight any wholesale tariff of 25% on all EU products.",
      "The tit-for-tat dispute following the vitriolic comments of Trump aimed at an age-old ally and its main postwar economic partner further deepened the trans-Atlantic rift that was already widened by Trump's warnings that Washington would drop security guarantees for its European allies.",
      "Thursday's EU pushback came after Trump told reporters that \u201cthe European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That\u2019s the purpose of it, and they\u2019ve done a good job of it,\u201d adding that it would stop immediately under his presidency.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, went on a counteroffensive.",
      "\u201cThe EU wasn\u2019t formed to screw anyone,\" Tusk said in an X post. \"Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade, and to strengthen our transatlantic friendship. As simple as that.\u201d",
      "The EU also warned that the moment the tariffs would be announced, it would trigger tough countermeasures, on iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles.",
      "\u201cThe EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade,\u201d European Commission trade spokesman Olof Gill said in a statement. \u201cWe will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.\u201d",
      "Trump said in comments late Wednesday that the United States stood ready.",
      "\u201cWe are the pot of gold. We\u2019re the one that everybody wants. And they can retaliate. But it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey. We don\u2019t buy any more. And if that happens, we win.\u201d",
      "Gill also countered Trump's caustic comments on the inception of the EU and its development as an economic powerhouse.",
      "\u201cThe European Union is the world\u2019s largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States,\u201d he said, adding that the EU has \u201cfacilitated trade, reduced costs for U.S. exporters, and harmonized standards and regulations,\u201d which makes it easier for U.S. exporters.",
      "The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. Trump has complained about a trade deficit, but while the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, the EU says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.",
      "The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU.",
      "The figures are so big that it remained essential to avoid a trade war, the EU has said.",
      "\u201cWe should work together to preserve these opportunities for our people and businesses. Not against each other,\u201d Gill said. \u201cEurope stands for dialogue, openness and reciprocity. We\u2019re ready to partner if you play by the rules.\u201d"

      "The People's Union USA calls the 24 hours of spending abstinence set to start at midnight an \u201ceconomic blackout,\u201d a term that has since been shared and debated on social media. The activist movement said it also plans to promote weeklong consumer boycotts of particular companies, including Walmart and Amazon.",
      "Other activists, faith-based leaders and consumers already are organizing boycotts to protest companies that have scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and to oppose President Donald Trump's moves to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies. Some faith leaders are encouraging their congregations to refrain from shopping at Target, one of the companies backing off DEI efforts, during the 40 days of Lent that begin Wednesday.",
      "Here are some details about the various events and experts' thoughts on whether having consumers keep their wallets closed is an effective tool for influencing the positions corporations take.",
      "The People's Union USA, which takes credit for initiating the no-spend day, was founded by John Schwarz, a meditation teacher who lives near the Chicago area, according to his social media accounts.",
      "The organization's website said it's not tied to a political party but stands for all people. Requests for comment sent to the group's email address this week did not receive a reply.",
      "The planned blackout is scheduled to run from 12 a.m. EST through 11:59 p.m. EST on Friday. The activist group advised customers to abstain from making any purchases, whether in store or online, but particularly not from big retailers or chains. It wants participants to avoid fast food and filling their car gas tanks, and says shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support a local small business and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "People's Union plans another broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing boycotts targeting specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",
      "There are a number of boycotts being planned, particularly aimed at Target. The discounter, which has backed diversity and inclusion efforts aimed at uplifting Black and LGBTQ+ people in the past, announced in January it was rolling back its DEI initiatives.",
      "A labor advocacy group called We Are Somebody, led by Nina Turner, launched a boycott of Target on February 1 to coincide with Black History Month.",
      "Meanwhile, an Atlanta-area pastor, the Rev. Jamal Bryant, organized a website called targetfast.org to recruit Christians for a a 40-day Target boycott starting March 5, which marks Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Other faith leaders have endorsed the protest.",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization, announced in late January it would identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be boycotted for abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion pledges. The organization formed a commission to identify potential candidates.",
      "\"Donald Trump can cut federal DEI programs to the bone, he can claw back federal money to expand diversity, but he cannot tell us what grocery store we shop at,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement posted on the National Action Network's website.",
      "Some retailers may feel a slight pinch from Friday's broad \u201cblackout,\u201d which is taking place in a tough economic environment, experts said. Renewed inflation worries and Trump's threat of tariffs on imported goods already have had an effect on consumer sentiment.",
      "\u201cThe (market share) pie is just so big,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to have your slices get smaller. Consumers are spending more money on food. And that means there\u2019s more pressure on general merchandise or discretionary products.\u201d",
      "Still, Cohen thinks the overall impact may be limited, with any meaningful sales declines more likely to surface in liberal-leaning coastal regions and big cities.",
      "Anna Tuchman, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said she thinks the economic blackout will likely make a dent in daily retail sales but won't be sustainable.",
      "\u201cI think this is an opportunity for consumers to show that they have a voice on a single day,\" she said. \u201dI think it\u2019s unlikely that we would see long-run sustained decreases in economic activity supported by this boycott.\u201d",
      "Other boycotts have produced different results.",
      "Target saw a drop in sales in the spring and summer quarter of 2023 that the discounter attributed in part to customer backlash over a collection honoring LGBTQ+ communities for Pride Month. As a result, Target didn\u2019t carry Pride merchandise in all of its stores the following year.",
      "Tuchman studied the impact of a boycott against Goya Foods during the summer of 2020 after the company's CEO praised Trump. But her study, based on sales from research firm Numerator, found the brand saw a sales increase driven by first-time Goya buyers who were disproportionately from heavily Republican areas.",
      "However, the revenue bump proved temporary; Goya had no detectable sales increase after three weeks, Tuchman said.",
      "It was a different story for Bud Light, which spent decades as America\u2019s bestselling beer. Sales plummeted in 2023 after the brand sent a commemorative can to a transgender influencer. Bud Light\u2019s sales still haven\u2019t fully recovered, according to alcohol consulting company Bump Williams.",
      "Tuchman thinks a reason is because there were plenty of other beers that the brand\u2019s mostly conservative customer base could buy to replace Bud Light.",
      "Afya Evans, a political and image consultant in Atlanta, said she would make a point of shopping on Friday but will focus on small businesses and Black-owned brands.",
      "Evans is aware of other boycotts but she said she liked this one because she believes it could have some effect on sales.",

      "An independent investigative committee in Greece has released a long-awaited investigation into the country's deadliest train crash",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- A long-awaited report on the investigation into Greece\u2019s deadliest train crash was released Thursday, blaming human error, outdated infrastructure and major systemic failures for the head-on collision that killed 57 people two years ago.",
      "The 178-page report was issued on the eve of a general strike and mass protests planned for the second anniversary of the Feb. 28, 2023 crash, fueled by public anger over the slow pace of a separate judicial inquiry.",
      "The independent investigative committee found that a routing mistake by a station master sent a passenger train onto the same track as an oncoming freight train. The collision, which killed 46 passengers and 11 staff including both train drivers, occurred near Tempe, 375 kilometers (235 miles) north of Athens.",
      "Investigators also highlighted poor training, staff shortages and a deteriorating railway system that lacked automated safety controls, noting a chronic lack of public investment during the 2010-18 financial crisis.",
      "The findings were published by the Hellenic Air and Rail Safety Investigation Authority.",
      "Authority director Christos Papadimitriou told The Associated Press that many safety improvements remain unfinished.",
      "\u201cAn accident doesn\u2019t occur by chance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are accumulating factors that contribute to the accident, because humans also tend to make mistakes.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThe Greek railway system didn\u2019t have in 2023 \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have today, too \u2014 the safety systems needed so that if one or two persons together make a mistake, such was the case in Tempe with the train driver and the station master, there would be mechanisms that won\u2019t allow this accident to happen.\u201d",
      "The government said that it would respond to the \u201cvery serious shortcomings and understaffing and underfunding,\u201d but added that claims made by opposition parties that it had hindered the investigation had been shown to be false.",
      "\u201cA cover-up is a very serious allegation and this is not (demonstrated) at any point in these findings,\u201d government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said. The government is deploying 5,000 police to patrol Athens Friday with public demonstrations planned and a general strike expected to halt or disrupt flights, ferries, public services and commercial activity.",

      "A private company is launching another lunar lander toward the moon",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private company launched another lunar lander Wednesday, aiming to get closer to the moon\u2019s south pole this time with a drone that will hop into a jet-black crater that never sees the sun.",
      "Intuitive Machines\u2019 lander, named Athena, caught a lift with SpaceX from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. It\u2019s taking a fast track to the moon \u2014 with a landing on March 6 \u2014 while hoping to avoid the fate of its predecessor, which tipped over at touchdown.",
      "Never before have so many spacecraft angled for the moon\u2019s surface all at once. Last month, U.S. and Japanese companies shared a rocket and separately launched landers toward Earth's sidekick. Texas-based Firefly Aerospace should get there first this weekend after a big head start.",
      "The two U.S. landers are carrying tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of experiments for NASA as it prepares to return astronauts to the moon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing time. There\u2019s so much energy,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox told The Associated Press a few hours ahead of the launch.",
      "This isn\u2019t Intuitive Machines\u2019 first lunar rodeo. Last year, the Texas company made the first U.S. touchdown on the moon in more than 50 years. But an instrument that gauges distance did not work and the lander came down too hard and broke a leg, tipping onto its side.",
      "Intuitive Machines said it has fixed the issue and dozens of others. A sideways landing like last time would prevent the drone and a pair of rovers from moving out. NASA\u2019s drill also needs an upright landing to pierce beneath the lunar surface to gather soil samples for analysis.",
      "\u201cCertainly, we will be better this time than we were last time. But you never know what could happen,\u201d said Trent Martin, senior vice president of space systems.",
      "It\u2019s an extraordinarily elite club. Only five countries have pulled off a lunar landing over the decades: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. The moon is littered with wreckage from many past failures.",
      "The 15-foot (4.7-meter) Athena will target a landing 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the lunar south pole. Just a quarter-mile (400 meters) away is a permanently shadowed crater \u2014 the ultimate destination for the drone named Grace.",
      "Named after the late computer programming pioneer Grace Hopper, the 3-foot (1-meter) drone will make three increasingly higher and longer test hops across the lunar surface using hydrazine fueled-thrusters for flight and cameras and lasers for navigation.",
      "If those excursions go well, it will hop into the nearby pitch-black crater, an estimated 65 feet (20 meters) deep. Science instruments from Hungary and Germany will take measurements at the bottom while hunting for frozen water.",
      "It will be the first up-close peek inside one of the many shadowed craters dotting both the north and south poles. Scientists suspect these craters are packed with tons of ice. If so, this ice could be transformed by future explorers into water to drink, air to breathe and even rocket fuel.",
      "NASA is paying $62 million to Intuitive Machines to get its drill and other experiments to the moon. The company, in turn, sold space on the lander to others. It also opened up the Falcon rocket to ride-sharing.",
      "Tagalongs included NASA\u2019s Lunar Trailblazer satellite, which will fly separately to the moon over the next several months before entering lunar orbit to map the distribution of water below. Also catching a ride was a private spacecraft that will chase after an asteroid for a flyby, a precursor to asteroid mining.",

      "BANGKOK -- World shares were mixed Thursday after U.S. stock indexes drifted to a lackluster finish, with the S&P 500 closing just an iota higher.",
      "Germany's DAX lost 0.9% to 22,584.04 and the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 0.3%, to 8,122.00. Britain's FTSE 100 was nearly unchanged at 8,734.36.",

      "Later Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department will issue its third and final estimate of how the U.S. economy performed in the final three months of 2024. The economy still appears to be in solid shape, and growth is continuing, though uncertainty is rising about the future. Another report on Friday will show how the gauge of inflation that the Federal Reserve prefers to use has been behaving.",
      "Worries have been rising about whether U.S. shoppers may cut back on their spending, a key driver of growth, given stubbornly high inflation and jitters about outlook.",

      "On Wednesday, U.S. stock indexes drifted to a mixed finish. The S&P 500 inched up by 0.1%, breaking a four-day losing streak that had knocked it off its all-time high. The Dow industrials fell 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.3%.",
      "The stock market has generally been struggling following some weaker-than-expected reports  on the economy, including a couple that showed U.S. households growing pessimistic  about inflation and higher tariffs pushed by President Donald Trump. Some of the harshest drops hit Big Tech and other high-growth stocks, whose incredible momentum had earlier seemed unstoppable.",
      "Super Micro Computer, one of the stocks that has soared in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence  technology, lost nearly a quarter of its value over four days, for example. But it jumped 12.2% Wednesday after filing its annual report for its fiscal year that ended in June.",
      "Much of the market\u2019s attention remained on Nvidia, the chip company that\u2019s become the poster child of the AI rush. It rose 3.7% ahead of its latest profit report, which arrived after trading ended for the day.",
      "The company reported a surge in fourth-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized Blackwell chips, which power artificial intelligence systems, continued to grow.",
      "It was the first earnings report for the company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the AI industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big U.S. rivals without having to use the most expensive chips. That called into question all the spending Wall Street assumed would go into not only Nvidia\u2019s chips but also the ecosystem that\u2019s built around the AI boom, including electricity to power large data centers.",
      "Some Big Tech companies have since said they still plan to invest billions of dollars into AI, an encouraging signal for the industry.",

      "Flagg, who\u2019s considered the potential No. 1 overall draft selection for the NBA, walked gingerly off the court with the aid of teammate Mason Gillis and trainer Jose Fonseca with 11:27 remaining. Duke led 14-11 at the time.",
      "Flagg, a 6-foot-9 phenom, had just returned to the game after being treated on the bench by Fonseca for an apparent cut on his face.",
      "Flagg exited the gym for additional evaluation before returning to the bench a few minutes later. But on the next timeout, he didn\u2019t join the rest of the Blue Devils in the huddle around Scheyer. He was cheering from the bench as the Blue Devils extended their double-digit lead. Then with about 5 1/2 minutes on the clock in the half, he exited the gym again and returned to the bench a few minutes later.",
      "Duke led 47-30 at the break.",
      "Flagg entered the game averaging 19.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists.",
      "Duke was already without starting point guard Tyrese Proctor, who sustained a knee injury Tuesday night at Miami, and injured backup forward Maliq Brown,",
      "Earlier in the week, Flagg set an Atlantic Coast Conference record by being selected as ACC Rookie of the Week for the 11th time.",

      "What followed was three quarters of frenetic basketball that concluded with 41 points by Mitchell and a breakout night by teammate Evan Mobley that added up to a 123-116 win and a ninth straight victory by the Cavs team that earned a season split with a Celtics team they could very well see in the playoffs.",

      "\u201cJust kind of having a pulse. Having a feel. I took some bad ones (shots) in the fourth that I didn\u2019t like, kind of settle,\" Mitchell said. \"But that\u2019s part of the process. But for me, kind of doing my job when my number\u2019s called. Keeping it steady. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d",

      "Mobley said it was a reminder to that he has the capacity to be an elite big man in the NBA.",
      "But as happy as they were to leave the court with a victory, Mitchell said it was tempered by the fact that the NBA's top offense found itself in a 22-point hole to begin with.",

      "A private lunar lander has touched down on the moon, delivering a drill and other experiments for NASA",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Mission Control reported, adding the lander was \u201cstable.\u201d",
      "A smooth, upright landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "Two other companies\u2019 landers are hot on Blue Ghost\u2019s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.",
      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route.

      "After its first lander slams into the moon in 2019, India regroups and launches Chandrayaan-3 (Hindi for moon craft) in 2023. The craft successfully touches down, making India the fourth country to score a lunar landing. The win comes just four days after Russia\u2019s crash-landing.",

      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",
      "Cybersecurity company Kaspersky advises not even saying anything when you receive what you think is a robocall. We've all received scammy calls that start with something like \u201cHello, can you hear me?\u201d to which you've probably replied \u201cyes\u201d without thinking.",
      "Scammers \u201ccan then store the recording of your confirmation and use it for fraudulent activities,\u201d Kaspersky says. \u201cSo, avoid saying yes where possible.\u201d",

      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",

Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",

      "Trump, who called the Ukrainian president a dictator last week, started the Oval Office spray in a smoother fashion, saying, \"We've actually known each other for a long time. We've been dealing with each other for a long time and very well there. We had a little negotiation spat, but that worked out great, I think, for both countries.\"",

And, of course, we count that America will not stop support. Really, for us, it's very important to support and to continue it. I want to discuss it with details further.\"",

      "\"We'll make a deal,\" he said. \"I have to make the deal first. I don't worry about security right now.\"",
      "Other cracks started to show just over 10 minutes into the spray, including one notable moment when Zelenskyy and Trump disagreed over the amount of support Europe has given Ukraine.",

      "\"They gave a lot -- but they gave much less,\" Trump replied, without providing details.",

      "\"It will not work without security guarantees,\" the Ukrainian president added.",
      "The president also defended his talks with Putin, saying it is the only way to get a deal across the finish line when he was pressed about concerns he's too aligned with Putin.",

      "\"What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don't think we can do business with Zelenskyy ever again,\" he said.",

And our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of Europe. Shame on you,\" Klobuchar wrote.",
      "\"Every time I've met with President Zelenskyy, he's thanked the American people for our strong support. We owe him our thanks for leading a nation fighting on the front lines of democracy -- not the public berating he received at the White House,\" Coons wrote.",

      "The cancellations left aid organizations reeling Thursday.",
      "Many, for weeks, had been advocating behind closed doors for their projects to continue and applying for waivers in order to deliver immediate, lifesaving aid while the review process was underway. Several organizations on Thursday decided to start to speak out as they face a future with almost all U.S. foreign aid cut off.",
      "\"Any type of communicable disease, I think we will see rage rampant. I think we will see increased conflict in the world. I think we will see increased terrorism in the world. And so, I think, the implications are going to be really dire in terms of the instability that this creates in already very unstable regions of the world,\" said Jocelyn Wyatt, CEO of Alight, an international organization that provides food, medicine and services for refugees in 20 countries around the world.",
      "Like all international aid organizations, four days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, Alight was told to suspend all programming funded through U.S. grants and contracts.",
      "Wyatt described scrambling to keep her organization's health care clinics afloat. They had to shutter programs in Uganda and Myanmar but were able to secure waivers from the State Department for lifesaving humanitarian aid to keep their operations going in Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan.",
      "But as of Thursday, all of Alight's U.S. contracts have been canceled going forward, even contracts related to those programs that had received waivers to continue in the last few weeks.",
      "Now, Wyatt said Alight is closing 33 health care clinics in Sudan, many in areas where they were the only health care provider, as well as water and sanitization services in three refugees camps in the country and another 13 clinics in Somalia.",
      "According to Wyatt, their clinics see 1,200 people a day in Somalia alone, including about 700 malnourished children a day at designated feeding centers where the children get weighed and provided with supplemental food.",
      "\"We are unable to provide any services to those severely malnourished children, and so it's really a matter of days or weeks before many of them will die,\" she told ABC News during an interview Thursday. \"The toll, the human lives that will be lost, is unfathomable.\"",

      "David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, called the termination of contracts \"a devastating blow.\"",
      "\"These are people who depend on the U.S.-funded services for the basics of survival. These programs are not just numbers on a spreadsheet; they represent real lives and real futures,\" he wrote in a statement, calling on the U.S. government to reconsider. \"The countries affected by these cuts -- including Sudan, Yemen, Syria -- are home to millions of innocent civilians who are victims of war and disaster. We now face the starkest of stark choices about which services can be protected, and are calling on the American public, corporations and philanthropists to show that America's generosity of spirit and commitment to the most vulnerable has not been lost.\"",

      "\"It seems cruelty is the point. This is not about putting America first. This will kill people around the world,\" the leader added.",
      "While aid organizations expected a review of their work with the new administration, the scope and scale of the cuts have been shocking and will mean many aid organizations will be forced to dramatically cut their work or shutdown all together.",
      "The termination notices were included in a court filing late Wednesday as leading aid organizations sued the federal government over nearly $2 billion in past payments they say they are owed for work already completed during the first part of this year.",
      "The filing stated that almost 5,800 USAID awards for future work, and approximately 4,100 distributed through the State Department, will be terminated, while around 500 USAID awards and roughly 2,700 State Department awards will be retained.",
      "Alight typically relies on U.S. foreign aid dollars for about 30% of their revenue and they have already had to lay off hundreds of staff members as they also wait for payments due from the U.S. federal government for work previously done.",
      "Still, Wyatt said her organization will survive and worries about others that will not as well as the impact it will have on the people they serve.",
      "Despite the turmoil of the last few weeks, she was reticent to speak publicly out of a concern that her organizatio,n and the clients they serve, could be impacted and retaliated against.",
      "She said she understands the new administration's push to evaluate taxpayer spending and foreign aid and that she was prepared to undergo an evaluation of their organization and make sure it aligned with Trump's American First foreign policy.",
      "But now that all of her contracts have been cancelled, Wyatt hopes to raise awareness and apply public pressure.",
      "International Medical Corps, one of the largest first responder and disaster relief organizations in the world, wrote in a statement that they received cancellation notices for \"the majority of our U.S. government-funded programs\" late Wednesday night.",

Though we receive funding from a variety of sources, this loss of funding will significantly impact our lifesaving global operations.

      "Transgender service members are fighting back against the Pentagon's recent announcement  requiring the separation of transgender people from the military.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Geirid Morgan has served in the Navy for 14 years as part of the medical service corps. She told ABC News that as an openly transgender woman, seeing the ban in \"black and white\" was \"jarring.\"",
      "\"I just want everyone to know that [transgender military members] have been serving honorably and effectively for a decade now,\" Morgan said. \"We serve in almost every job role you can imagine in the military. We have doctors, lawyers, fighter pilots, special operations personnel.",
      "\"This is a calling, this is a this is a life of sacrifice, a life of service. This isn't just a job, this isn't just a career,\" Morgan added. \"We're all over the place. We're doing the jobs. We're doing it effectively, and that's it.\"",
      "Morgan is part of a lawsuit filed earlier this month by the Human Rights Campaign and Lambda Legal against President Donald Trump following his executive order banning transgender service members from the military.",
      "On Wednesday night, the Pentagon's new transgender policy, as approved by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was disclosed in a memo filed as an exhibit file by the Defense Department in another court case challenging Trump's order.",
      "The memo requires the Pentagon to form a procedure to identify transgender troops by March 26 and separate them from the military by June 25, unless they receive an exemption. This would include service members receiving some form of treatment or hormones for that diagnosis of gender dysphoria, as well as those who have gone through a gender-affirming surgery.",
      "\"I'm going to put my uniform on every day, go to work, do my job with the best of my abilities for as long as I'm able to,\" Morgan added.",
      "Sasha Buchert, an attorney for Lambda Legal who served in the military while openly transgender, told ABC News that the recent Pentagon memorandum does not come as a surprise.",
      "\"This is exactly what we anticipated, and it's exactly how we framed up our complaint and our motion for preliminary injunction,\" Buchert said on Thursday. \"The executive order, frankly, is dripping with animus, and we expected nothing less than exactly what we got today. So there is absolutely no surprises, and it's absolutely shameful.\"",
      "When asked what else could be expected of the Trump administration regarding transgender service members, Buchert said there is \"no bottom\" to how extreme the administration may take things.",
      "\"Of all of the national security priorities that we have and all of the domestic priorities we have as a country, they've chosen transgender people as a top priority of things to work on,\" Buchert said. \"I think it's shameful and disgraceful and has caused great harm to both transgender military service members and their families, but also to the military at large.\"",
      "\"This is just plain wrong,\" Buchert added. \"This is the opposite of a meritocracy.\"",
      "The lawsuit, Shilling v. Trump, claims the ban on transgender service members is unconstitutional and violates fairness principles. Plaintiffs include transgender service members from a range of military branches affected by the Trump administration.",
      "Buchert added that removing thousands of transgender service members will negatively affect the military financially given the U.S. military investment in each troop's training and development. A 2020 Palm Center study found the removal of these troops would cost nearly $1 billion.",
      "There are currently 4,240 active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a defense official previously told ABC News.",

      "The first time Donald Trump spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he tried to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first time he spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump tried to pressure Ukraine's new leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. It was a 2019 phone call that eventually sparked an impeachment.",
      "On Friday, a meeting in the Oval Office that started out with cordialities turned heated at the end, with Vice President JD Vance telling Zelenskyy to show more gratitude toward Trump, before the president himself began shouting.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people,\" Trump berated Zelenskyy. \"You\u2019re gambling with World War III.\u201d",
      "With that, Trump scrapped plans to sign an agreement that would have allowed the U.S. to access Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, a deal the U.S. president had said would have helped move the war toward a conclusion. The blowup cast new doubt on the future of U.S. support for Kyiv in fending off Russia's invasion.",
      "A look at the evolution of Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship over the years:",
      "In July 2019, Zelenskyy was anxious for a meeting with Trump at the White House, one of the Ukrainian leader's top foreign policy priorities at the time.",
      "During a 30-minute call, Trump dangled the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. But he also suggested that future U.S. military support for Ukraine might be contingent on its leader helping investigate business dealings there by Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son.",
      "The elder Biden was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Trump seemed to want to weaken him 15 months out from Election Day.",
      "Trump denied wrongdoing and began referring to his exchange with Zelenskyy as a \u201cperfect\" phone call. Even Zelenskyy later insisted that he faced \u201cno blackmail.\u201d",
      "But Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges, only the third American commander in chief to be in that situation. He was acquitted by the Senate.",
      "Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, triggering the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has provided more than $65 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The Biden administration made steadfast military and political support for Zelenskyy's country a centerpiece of his foreign policy.",
      "As the war raged, the Biden White House staunchly defended continuing to provide support to Ukraine, even as some Republicans began grumbling about so much funding for a war that had no end in sight.",
      "In a speech to Congress in December 2022, Zelenskyy thanked \"every American\" for supporting his country.",
      "\u201cYour money is not charity,\u201d he said then. \"It\u2019s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.\u201d",
      "Trump, then campaigning for his second term, said repeatedly that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he'd been president and that he'd have no trouble solving the conflict.",
      "Upon taking office, he upended years of U.S. policy by dispatching negotiators to Saudi Arabia to meet with officials from Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, and also began hammering out the minerals deal that he and Zelenskyy had planned to sign Friday.",
      "Last September, Zelenskyy accompanied Biden to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers producing some of the most critically needed munitions for his country\u2019s fight with Russian ground forces.",
      "A few days later, he traveled to Trump Tower in Manhattan and discussed ending the war. In comments to Fox News Channel afterward, Trump said of the fighting, \u201cIt should stop and the president wants it to stop,\" meaning Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that\u2019s a good combination,\u201d Trump added. Zelenskyy invited Trump to visit Ukraine, to which Trump responded, \u201dI will.\"",
      "That trip came up again Friday, when Vance told Zelenskyy, \u201cYou went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's September trip was not billed as political, though, and Trump's election opponent was Vice President Kamala Harris, not Biden. Still, Pennsylvania is a battleground state and some congressional Republicans at the time accused Democrats of using Zelenskyy's visit to bolster Harris politically.",
      "Last December, Trump met with Zelenskyy again during a visit to Paris to attend the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral. It was a hastily arranged three-way meeting set up by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was trying to push the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "As president, Trump has publicly prodded Zelenskyy that he had better move quickly to negotiate an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, or risk no longer having a country to lead. On his social media site, Trump decried Zelenskyy for not organizing an election to decide if he should remain in power \u2014 an idea backed by Russia \u2014 calling him a \u201c dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "He also suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, but later conceded that Russia was the aggressor.",
      "Before this week, Zelenskyy had been to the White House four times \u2014 all during the Biden administration. When the Ukrainian leader announced he was coming to Washington and was ready to sign a minerals deal, Trump's tone got more conciliatory.",
      "He called America\u2019s support for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion \u201ca very worthy thing to do.\u201d And, when pressed about having called Zelenskyy a dictator, Trump responded: \u201cDid I say that? I can\u2019t believe I said that. Next question.\"",
      "It all served to make Friday's blowup all the more spectacular."

      "A federal judge has ruled that the head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, saying President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful",
      "WASHINGTON -- The head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, a judge in Washington ruled on Saturday, saying President Donald Trump's bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, in a legal battle over the president's authority to oust the head of the independent agency that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired, even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic president Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Jackson rejected the Trump administration's claims that the special counsel's removal protections are unconstitutional because they prevent the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "The judge said allowing the president to remove the special counsel at will would have a chilling effect on his crucial duties, which include guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing.",
      "\u201cThe Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing \u2014 by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,\u201d Jackson wrote in her decision.",
      "The Justice Department quickly filed court papers indicating it will challenge the ruling to Washington's federal appeals court. The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.",
      "The ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration\u2019s massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\u201d",
      "The judge said the special counsel has a \u201cunique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\u201d Dellinger told reporters outside Washington\u2019s federal courthouse after a recent hearing.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger\u2019s firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.",
      "The Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \u201ca constitutional red line\u201d by blocking Dellinger\u2019s firing and stopping Trump \u201cfrom shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration\u2019s critical first days.\u201d",
      "Dellinger was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024."

      "The Associated Press obtained information that says President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has begun terminating federal grants to organizations that enforce the federal Fair Housing Act's anti-discrimination laws",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has begun terminating grants to organizations that enforce the Fair Housing Act by taking complaints, investigating and litigating housing discrimination cases for Americans across the country, according to documents and information obtained by The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "The grants are disbursed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to private nonprofits, which act as the frontline enforcement of the federal anti-discrimination law passed in 1968. They educate communities on their rights, test whether a landlord is racially discriminating, investigate complaints, resolve disputes and can help with legal counsel.",
      "Of an estimated 34,000 fair housing complaints lodged in the U.S. in 2023, these private nonprofits processed 75%, according to a report from the National Fair Housing Alliance. The rest were fielded by state and local governments, with HUD and the U.S. Department of Justice working on less than 6% combined.",
      "It is the highest number of complaints since the first report in the 1990s, and over half were lodged for discrimination based on a disability.",
      "Now, of the 162 active grants going to the private nonprofits to do that work, nearly half are slated for cancellation, said Nikitra Bailey, executive vice president at the National Fair Housing Alliance. Bailey added that some organizations rely entirely on the grants and may have to shutter, others will have to lay off staff and limit services.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s doing it at a time when Americans want to see an end to the barrage of rising housing costs and a lack of housing supply,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThey need increased support and intervention from our federal government, not a withdrawal from basic civil rights.\u201d",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for HUD said: \u201cThe Department is responsible for ensuring our grantees and contractors are in compliance with the President\u2019s Executive Orders. If we determine they are not in compliance, then we are required to take action. The Department will continue to serve the American people, including those are facing housing discrimination or eviction.\u201d",
      "The \u201cprogram really exists because the fair housing laws don\u2019t enforce themselves,\u201d said Maureen St. Cyr, executive director of Massachusetts Fair Housing Center, a group that\u2019s grant is being terminated. \u201cPeople need lawyers to make those rights a reality.\u201d",
      "St. Cyr listed several scenarios the nonprofit has helped with: a family being denied housing because they have children, a veteran with a disability needing a ramp and a domestic abuse survivor being evicted because of the actions of the abuser.",
      "\u201cWe are doing a lot of work with pretty minimal money,\u201d St. Cyr said.",
      "The grants intended for fair housing enforcement, part of HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program, are largely worth $425,000, an amount which is typically issued annually to organizations.",
      "In a termination letter, a copy of which was obtained by the AP, HUD said that the cancellations were at the direction of Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, called DOGE, run partly by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The letters caused widespread confusion across the country late Thursday night, as fair housing organizations started communicating through listservs, assessing the potential impacts and trying to find answers.",
      "One of the organizations slated to lose funding, Fair Housing Center of Metropolitan Detroit, fields about 200 to 300 fair housing complaints a year and works broadly to resolve housing related problems, such as disputes with landlords, with a coverage area of some 4 million people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a significant threat to the viability of our organization at a minimum,\u201d said Steve Tomkowiak, the group's executive director. \u201cIt can threaten the survival of any of the fair housing enforcement organizations.\u201d",
      "For Kimberly Merchant, CEO of Mississippi Center for Justice, the kneecapping of fair housing groups, or their disappearance altogether, would be \u201copen season to discriminate indiscriminately without having to worry about being checked.\u201d",

      "The designated survivor for a president's address to Congress starts the day as a Cabinet secretary and ends it that way, too, God willing",
      "WASHINGTON -- They start the day often as low-profile Cabinet secretaries. They end it that way, too, God willing.",
      "But, when the rest of the government is gathered together for a big event, like President Donald Trump 's joint congressional address Tuesday night, a designated survivor is kept away to ensure someone in the line of presidential succession stays alive.",
      "Picking a failsafe in case of a cataclysmic event that wipes out everyone else dates back to the Cold War. It's been dramatized in novels and an ABC series starring Kiefer Sutherland that aired from 2016 to 2019.",
      "Being the actual designated survivor brings extra adrenaline jolts and humbling thoughts about being unwittingly catapulted into the presidency and unthinkable tragedy \u2014 though the minute-to-minute details usually don't feature the high drama of fictional portrayals, those who have filled the role say.",
      "\u201cIt focuses your mind. It also enhances your prayer that it doesn\u2019t happen to you,\u201d James Nicholson, who was President George W. Bush's veterans affairs secretary and designated survivor during the 2006 State of the Union, said of possibly becoming president after a cataclysmic event.",
      "Trump\u2019s White House hasn\u2019t said who will be the designated survivor choice Tuesday. Historian and journalist Garrett M. Graff said the concept of designated survivor has long captivated people because it combines the public's inherent fascination with danger and the romance of an \u201ceveryman\u201d being thrust into the presidency.",
      "\u201cThe idea of, you\u2019re just a random Cabinet official, and then something terrible happens and, all of a sudden, you\u2019re president of the United States,\" said Graff, author of \u201cRaven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government\u2019s Secret Plan to Save Itself \u2014 While the Rest of Us Die.\u201d",
      "Until the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, designated survivors had more control over where they went outside Washington. President Bill Clinton's energy secretary, the late Bill Richardson, was picked in 2000 and simply moved up a planned weekend trip with his wife to Oxford, Maryland, a waterfront town about 80 miles away, so he'd be there during the State of the Union.",
      "When Dan Glickman, Clinton\u2019s agriculture secretary, was tapped during the 1997 State of the Union, his hometown of Wichita, Kansas, was too far away, so he chose New York, where his daughter lived.",
      "\u201cI thought it was kind of exciting. But I wasn\u2019t hyped up from a dangerous perspective,\u201d Glickman said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think anybody told me to be careful.\u201d",
      "Alberto Gonzales, Bush's attorney general, was the designated survivor during the 2007 State of the Union. He said White House chief of staff Josh Bolten called a few days before and gave a couple of options for where he could hunker down.",
      "Gonzales chose to be in flight, and he arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to find \u201cmembers of every major department and agency\u201d there to ride with him. They carried thick binders stuffed with memos and protocol instructions, just in case.",
      "He said there were a series of briefings that may have stretched right into Bush's speech, which he watched from the air.",
      "\u201cIt was during that time that it sort of suddenly hit me, if something happened in the Capitol and everyone's killed, that I'd be president,\u201d Gonzales said. \"It's sort of sobering. And you wonder, would I be up to governing a wounded nation?\u201d",
      "In \u201cRaven Rock,\u201d Graff details how the designated survivor concept was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations amid fears that Soviet subs just off the Atlantic Coast could fire nuclear missiles and wipe out Washington with barely 10 minutes\u2019 warning.",
      "Beginning in April 1980, the White House Military Office tasked the Federal Emergency Management Agency with ensuring succession. An aide was directed to recommend to the president who should skip events when all possible successors were together outside the White House.",
      "Officials still prepare for a massive attack or disaster. The military helicopter that collided with a regional jet outside Reagan National Airport in January was on a continuity of government mission \u2014 training to keep the federal government functioning in case of catastrophe.",
      "The first time that a Cabinet member being kept away from a presidential speech to Congress was publicly divulged was President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Education Secretary Terrel Bell in 1981. But Bell wasn\u2019t identified until afterward.",
      "Today, TV images from the House chamber allow political junkies to spot the missing Cabinet member within minutes.",
      "Nicholson said Bush\u2019s then-chief of staff, Andy Card, had asked him a few weeks before the State of the Union to take on the role. He was a natural fit given that his agency played an important role in continuity of government exercises due to its numerous hospitals and clinics nationwide.",
      "Nicholson flew by helicopter to a destination only divulged once he was in the air, and later sat in a command center, where he underwent briefings before watching Bush\u2019s speech.",
      "He was served a \u201cwonderful\u201d dinner, prepared onsite by personnel from the White House mess, though he can't recall if it was T-bone steak or prime rib or something similar. \u201cIt made you think that, at least, if this awful thing happened, you\u2019d be well fed,\" he said.",
      "\u201cThe enormity of that job. You think about, remote as it is, this is something you might have to do,\u201d he said of becoming president. Nicholson's wife was attending the State of the Union, meaning that if something happened, she could be among the victims, which only added to the pressure.",
      "When it was over, Nicholson wasn't asked to fill in his predecessor in the role, Gonzales, or future designated survivors.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a club,\u201d he laughed. \"We should.\u201d",
      "Glickman recalls boarding an Air Force G-3 from Andrews along with Secret Service agents, a military official and a series of advisers not on his usual staff. A three-car motorcade later carried him from LaGuardia Airport to his daughter's apartment near Union Square in Manhattan.",
      "She wanted to invite others to watch the speech with them, but Glickman nixed that. \u201cThis was not a party,\" he said.",
      "It wasn't all serious, though. Glickman said he was told he didn't need to dress up, so he didn't wear a suit. Instructions not to study up spared him from reading briefing books or memorizing security protocols.",
      "After the speech, the Secret Service asked if Glickman wanted a ride to the airport. He declined, saying he planned to have dinner with his daughter. It was sleeting when the motorcade left without him, making taxis scarce and the sudden return to real life especially abrupt.",
      "\u201cI was the most powerful man on the face of the earth, theoretically,\" Glickman remembered joking to his daughter. \"And then I can't even get a cab.\u201d",

      "Democrats filled Republican town halls during the congressional break to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s power grab in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Furious Democrats filled Republican town halls across America last week to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s power grab in Washington.",
      "But in recent days, the activists behind those protests have turned their anger toward elected officials in their own party, who they believe are not fighting the Republican president and billionaire adviser Elon Musk with the urgency, aggression or creativity that the moment deserves.",
      "\u201cAre we in a constitutional crisis or not?\u201d said Ezra Levin, co-founder of the anti-Trump resistance group Indivisible, which encouraged progressives to attend town halls and protest outside Tesla dealerships.",
      "Of Democratic leaders, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s zero tactical or innovative leadership.\u201d",
      "Indeed, as Trump moves to consolidate control in Washington with little regard for precedent or judges ruling against him, the nation's most powerful Democrats are offering mixed messages while struggling to break from the rules and norms that have long governed U.S. politics.",
      "Key Democratic governors have spoken out with varying levels of concern, but they have also promised to work with the Trump administration to ensure resources flow to their states.",
      "House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has taken heat for spending part of last week's congressional recess promoting a children's book he wrote about democracy. Asked about activists' frustration, he pointed to his party's united opposition to the GOP budget bill and to the more than 100 lawsuits brought against the president.",
      "\u201cWe have to continue to push back aggressively in every way possible in defense of the American people,\" Jeffries insisted, acknowledging voters' \u201cconcern, fear, shock and anxiety.\u201d",
      "Republicans have control of the House and Senate. Some Democrats think they are nearing the limit of what they can do to stop Trump, and so the party should stand back.",
      "Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville said as much out loud earlier in the week in a New York Times opinion piece in which he encouraged his party to embrace a \u201cstrategic retreat\u201d to let Trump and his Republican allies take the blame for the chaos they create.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead,\u201d Carville wrote.",
      "The piece infuriated Democratic activists. But some officials in Washington quietly welcomed Carville\u2019s call for Democrats to get out of Trump\u2019s way.",
      "\u201cThe Carville point was that there\u2019s got to be an opportunity for people to start experiencing and coming to their own conclusion,\u201d said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s easier said than done on Carville is that people are freaked out and they do want us to do something and we want to do something,\u201d Welch added. \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma.\u201d",
      "In Trump's first month in office, he and Musk have moved with extraordinary speed to cut tens of thousands of jobs from the federal workforce. The president is trying to eliminate entire agencies established by federal law. He has signed dozens of executive orders and begun to exact retribution against perceived political enemies across the government, firing independent inspectors general, federal prosecutors and FBI agents involved with his previous prosecutions.",
      "Trump and his allies have lashed out against judges and threatened to defy court rulings.",
      "So far, neither Jeffries nor Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York has been willing to employ perhaps the most dramatic tool at their disposal to stop Trump: their vote \u2014 and the ability to withhold their vote in protest \u2014 even if it means shutting down the government.",
      "There are some Democrats who want their party to pursue a shutdown on March 14 when current funding expires. But historically, shutdowns have been a Republican strategy only. Democrats generally see themselves as the political grown-ups in the room.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Democrats \u201cneed to be more imaginative and ingenious and aggressive in our tactics.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut that should not mean that we depart from basic values,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cCourt orders should be obeyed. We have to respect the rule of law. But we also have to be more nimble and agile in the tactics and tools we use, and be exhaustive in every legal means of fighting back.\u201d",
      "Democratic governors \u2014 and 2028 presidential prospects \u2014 have spoken out with varying levels of concern.",
      "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer dined at the White House with Trump last week as part of the National Governors Association annual meeting. Afterward, she told Michigan media that she continues to look for \u201ccommon ground\u201d with the president.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who this past week announced a new podcast featuring Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d allies, has softened his stance on Trump in an effort to ensure the Republican administration doesn\u2019t block disaster funding for the state\u2019s devastating wildfires.",
      "Whitmer and Newsom have also been sharply critical of Trump throughout their careers. At the same time, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker used his recent State of the State address to liken Trump\u2019s power grabs to the conditions that preceded the Holocaust.",
      "\u201cIt took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,\u201d Pritzker charged. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.\u201d",
      "Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, took to the Senate floor last week to call on his colleagues to \u201cwake up.\u201d In a subsequent interview, King described what he called Trump\u2019s \u201cassault on the Constitution \u2014 the most serious in the history of the country.\u201d",
      "The senator said Democrats cannot simply assume that the courts will rein in Trump. But he also acknowledged that they had relatively few tools to push back as the minority party in both chambers of Congress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory. There\u2019s no playbook for this,\u201d King said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to figure out what\u2019s effective.\u201d",
      "The Democratic base is not in a patient mood.",
      "Lori Goldman, who leads the Michigan-based activist group known as Fems for Dems, was enraged when asked for her assessment of Democratic leaders.",
      "\u201cWe need all hands on deck, and we\u2019re not getting it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no room or time or space to act like we\u2019re in normal times.\u201d",
      "Klein, of Indivisible, is growing increasingly pessimistic that Democratic leaders in Congress are listening even after his group took credit for town halls that shaped the debate on Capitol Hill.",
      "\u201cI was hopeful that they were coming over to our side to lead the opposition, and in the absence of that, I think you\u2019re going to just see distance between them and their own constituents grow and grow and grow,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t have positive consequences.\u201d",

      "In January, an endangered Florida panther known as UCFP479 became the first to die this year in a vehicle collision along a rural southwestern Florida road",
      "FLORIDA PANTHER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Fla. -- In January, an endangered Florida panther known as UCFP479 became the first to die this year in a vehicle collision along a rural southwestern Florida road.",
      "The male panther, just under 2 years old, will not be the last.",
      "In 2024, 36 panther deaths were recorded by state wildlife officials, which was the most since 2016. The majority of those deaths are the result of collisions with vehicles, including one that was struck by a train, state statistics show.",
      "An estimated 120 to 230 adult Florida panthers live in the wild in the state's southwestern corner, where they are faced with a booming human population and the accompanying development.",
      "The Florida panther, which is similar to but smaller than the Western cougar or mountain lion, once roamed across a large swath of the southeastern U.S. Hunting and habitat loss have decimated the species' numbers and confined them to a shrinking space of about 2 million acres (809,000 hectares), according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "Indeed, along what were once narrow country roads in eastern Collier and Lee counties there are numerous major projects under way that will create tens of thousands of homes and the traffic that comes with them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at a critical juncture now,\u201d said Michael McGrath of the Sierra Club, which recently led a tour of panther country for journalists and activists. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more and more deaths. Sprawl kills.\u201d",
      "Environmental groups have been fighting an uphill battle to curb some of the development and vow to continue those efforts.",
      "\u201cYou can see all of that land is primary panther habitat,\u201d said Amber Crooks, environmental policy manager at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. \u201cWe have to fight until that last decision is made.\u201d",
      "The Florida panther is the only established population of pumas east of the Mississippi River, according to the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. They have been listed as federally endangered since 1967. A 26,600-acre (10,700-hectare) panther refuge was established in 1989 next to the Big Cypress National Preserve, west of the Everglades.",
      "In 1981, the state began capturing panthers to check their health, administer vaccines, take genetic samples and fit them with radio collars to track them.",
      "The panther population at one point in the 1990s dropped to around 50 animals, in part because of inbreeding that caused numerous health problems. That led officials to import eight female Texas pumas to Florida to breed with males, helping boost panther numbers and improving their genetic diversity. The offspring are considered to be Florida panthers and are protected under the Endangered Species Act, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "Florida panthers resemble the cougars and pumas found in the American West, with beige or tan fur and white markings underneath. They eat various types of prey, especially deer and raccoons.",
      "Males tend to roam more than females in search of territory and sometimes are spotted near the Orlando area. One male was shot and killed by a hunter in Georgia in 2008, wildlife officials say. Because males roam more, they are more prone to being struck by vehicles.",
      "Panthers face the threat of disease, including a form of feline leukemia transmitted to them by domestic cats. Bobcats also are prone to the disease.",
      "A 2002 outbreak of feline leukemia killed at least five panthers, federal wildlife officials say.",
      "Another emerging disease appears to cause weakness in the rear legs of panthers and bobcats, many of them seen walking unsteadily on trail video cameras.",
      "\"We encourage the public to continue to submit footage and pictures of wildlife that appear to have problems with their rear legs,\u201d the Florida wildlife commission said in an online post.",
      "Some are killed through fights among themselves, especially males.",

      "Actor Gene Hackman and his wife made Santa Fe their home decades ago",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The pi\u00f1on- and juniper-scented Rocky Mountain foothills overlooking Santa Fe have helped the city earn a reputation as a refuge for famous actors and authors seeking to escape the spotlight.",
      "Sometimes the world's attention is unavoidable, as it was this week when Oscar-winner Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead inside their home in those very foothills.",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, eschewed fame and made Santa Fe their home decades ago, like many other acclaimed artists, including the former playwright Sam Shepard, actors Shirley MacLaine and Ali MacGraw, and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "In addition to the fresh air and mountain vistas, Santa Fe \u2014 situated more than a mile above sea level \u2014 is known for Pueblo-style architecture, Southwest-themed art galleries and turquoise jewelry-filled boutiques. Initially settled by Indigenous people and once colonized by Spain, the capital city of New Mexico today embraces a low-key vibe where young skateboarders share the sidewalks with wealthy retirees decked out in Pendleton cardigans and cowboy boots.",
      "It's not uncommon to see a famous person strolling downtown, dining out or hiking on the numerous trails; it's just that locals know not to gush over them.",
      "\"You recognize that celebrities who come here are coming here for the same reason. They just want to live and be normal people,\u201d artist Kristin Bortles said, taking a break from planning a mural for a new coffee shop.",
      "The normally laid back city was in collective shock Thursday as news spread about Hackman and Arakawa. The last time a crush of media descended on Santa Fe was when Alec Baldwin shot and killed a cinematographer on the set of the movie \u201cRust.\u201d",
      "On Friday, conversations about what had happened to Hackman and his wife always came back to Santa Fe's reputation as a place where celebrities could unwind and live unassuming lives far from the glitz of Los Angeles or New York City \u2014 and even some of the more glamorous Rocky Mountain enclaves, like Vail, Colorado.",
      "Hackman retired in the early 2000s after a decades-long career that included roles as villains, heroes and antiheroes in dozens of dramas, comedies and action films. Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen on the Hollywood social circuit.",
      "He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe and wrote a novel about the American West centered on New Mexico called \u201cPayback at Morning Peak\u201d and coauthored one on the Civil War entitled \u201cEscape from Andersonville.\" (A real life battle took place just east of Santa Fe in 1862, at Glorieta Pass.)",
      "Hackman and Arakawa lived in a multilevel Pueblo-style home that blends in with the surrounding geography. He enjoyed weekly Pilates classes, bicycle rides along paved trails and getting fresh eggs dropped off by friends.",
      "While Hackman kept a tight circle of friends and didn't go out much, he was sometimes spotted downtown. But one of the most accomplished actors of his generation mostly blended in.",
      "\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve learned about Santa Fe is that you never know who you\u2019re talking to, you never know who you\u2019re going to meet or who\u2019s around the corner,\u201d said Gabriel Garcia, whose family has been selling jewelry and leather crafts on the Santa Fe Plaza for more than 60 years.",
      "Hackman usually was in jeans, a flannel shirt and sometimes a baseball cap, said friend Stuart Ashman, the former head of the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs and past CEO of the International Folk Art Market.",
      "\u201cObviously he was a huge star,\" Ashman said, \"but you would never know it when you talked to him because he had that sort of what I call a princely attitude, where he\u2019s focused on you and asks you about you, not talking about himself.\u201d",
      "Hackman enjoyed painting and was drawn to the beauty of the hills surrounding Santa Fe and the light of the high desert, Ashman said.",
      "Arakawa, a classical musician, was soft spoken and never one to expect special treatment, said Larry Keller, owner of a high-end furniture and art store where she would shop.",
      "Being a part of the Santa Fe community, he said, means not drawing extra attention to someone because of their celebrity status.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re too cool for school, you know. That\u2019s the Santa Fe vibe,\u201d Keller said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- All it took was 90 seconds for weeks of tortured diplomacy to unwind in spectacular fashion.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office thrashing of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday laid bare the limits of a full-court press by America\u2019s allies aimed at reshaping Trump\u2019s determination to end Russia\u2019s invasion even if the terms are not to Ukraine\u2019s liking.",
      "It also stressed the profound ways Trump feels emboldened to redirect U.S. foreign policy priorities toward his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda in ways that extend well beyond those of his tumultuous first term.",
      "The sudden blowup was the most heated public exchange of words between world leaders in the Oval Office in memory, as the usual staid work of diplomacy descended into finger-pointing, shouting and eye-rolling.",
      "The encounter left the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv\u2019s ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia, in mortal jeopardy.",
      "\u201cYou either make a deal or we are out,\u201d Trump told Zelenskyy, underscoring the American leader\u2019s plans to dictate a swift end to the war or leave its longtime ally to continue the fight without its strongest backer.",
      "The stunning episode capped a week of what turned out to be largely futile efforts by U.S. allies to paper over differences between Washington and Kyiv and to try to steer Trump away from his flirtations with Moscow.",
      "On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron huddled with Trump to lay the groundwork for an eventual European-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine aimed at deterring future Russian aggression and to encourage the U.S. president to be more skeptical of Vladimir Putin.",
      "But even as Trump and Macron greeted each other with a vise-like grip, the U.S. was splitting with its European allies at the United Nations by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in a series of resolutions marking the three-year anniversary of the war.",
      "On Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited Washington and appealed to Trump for a U.S. \u201cbackstop\u201d for European nations who would provide front-line security for Ukraine. He was in essence looking for insurance that, should a peace deal be reached, Russia won\u2019t restart the fighting in the future. Starmer brought flattery and a state visit invitation from King Charles III to soften the ask.",
      "The approach seemed to work, as Trump struck a more conciliatory tone toward Ukraine, calling America\u2019s support for the country against Russia\u2019s invasion \u201ca very worthy thing to do\u201d and disclaiming any memory that he had called the Ukrainian leader a \u201cdictator.\u201d",
      "But Trump also brushed aside Putin\u2019s past broken diplomatic promises, claiming they occurred under different presidents, and saying the Russian leader had never violated a commitment to him. It came as his aides were planning a series of negotiating sessions with Russian officials to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Trump and Putin in the coming weeks.",
      "All the while, Trump was focused on securing a financial stake in Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals to recoup the tens of billions the U.S. has given to Kyiv to defend itself. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, wanted more than Washington\u2019s vague promises that the U.S. would work to preserve its economic interest in Ukraine under the agreement and pushed for more concrete security guarantees.",
      "But Trump would not budge, and U.S. officials repeatedly said Zelenskyy would not be welcome to meet with the president to discuss Trump\u2019s push for negotiations with Russia until it was signed. After weeks of browbeating, Zelenskyy\u2019s government on Wednesday formally agreed to the proposal, clearing the path for Friday\u2019s meeting.",
      "It started off cordially enough, as Trump and Zelenskyy spoke politely, even with admiration, of one of another for the first half-hour of the meeting. Trump even suggested he would continue some military assistance to Ukraine until he could secure an enduring peace deal with Russia.",
      "But when the Ukrainian leader raised alarm about trusting any promises from Putin to end the fighting, Vice President JD Vance rebuked him for airing disagreements with Trump in public. It instantly shifted the tenor of the conversation. Zelenskyy grew defensive, and Trump and his vice president blasted him as ungrateful and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and issued stark warnings about future American support.",
      "South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, both a defense hawk and a strident ally of Trump\u2019s, said he had warned Zelenskyy ahead of the meeting \u201cnot to take the bait\u201d in his dealings with Trump, who has repeatedly shown a penchant for throwing criticism but a deep resistance to receiving it.",
      "It was Vance \u2014 a longtime critic of American support for Ukraine \u2014 who dangled it, when he insisted diplomacy was the only pathway forward.",
      "\u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\u201d Zelenskyy said, listing Russia\u2019s past violations of ceasefires. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m talking about the kind of diplomacy that\u2019s going to end the destruction of your country,\u201d Vance responded before tearing into the Ukrainian leader. \u201cMr. President, with respect, I think it\u2019s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\u201d",
      "Trump then let loose, warning the Ukrainian leader, \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you\u2019re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that\u2019s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\u201d",
      "At another point, Trump declared himself \u201cin the middle,\u201d seeming to formally break from years of American support for Ukraine. He went on to deride Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201chatred\u201d for Putin as a roadblock to peace.",
      "\u201cYou see the hatred he\u2019s got for Putin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\u201d Trump said to Zelenskyy as the two leaders talked over each other.",
      "The episode was just the latest instance of Trump's brazen moves to shift long-held American policy positions in his first six weeks back in office, portending even more uncertainty ahead for longtime American allies and partners who have already felt pressed to justify their place in Trump's eyes. It comes just weeks after Trump floated a permanent relocation of Palestinians in Gaza and an American takeover of the territory, and as he has doubled down on plans to put stiff tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada starting next week.",
      "After the Oval Office dustup, Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House by top Trump advisers \u2014 scrapping plans for a lunch, a joint press conference and the signing of the economic agreement, even as the Ukrainian leader and his aides pushed for a \u201creset\u201d on the meeting.",
      "Trump later told reporters he didn\u2019t want to \u201cembolden\u201d the Ukrainian leader if he didn\u2019t want \u201cpeace\u201d with Russia \u2014 flipping what Ukraine had seen as an inducement for security guarantees into a cudgel.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t embolden somebody who does not have the cards,\u201d Trump said.",
      "After the disastrous encounter, Zelenskyy appeared on Fox News on Friday evening and told Bret Baier that his public spat with Trump and Vance was \u201cnot good for both sides.\u201d But Zelenskyy said Trump \u2014 who insists Putin is ready to end the three-year grinding war \u2014 needs to understand that Ukraine can\u2019t change its attitudes toward Russia on a dime.",

      "Collins \u2014 a guitar-playing researcher and evangelical Christian known for finding common ground between religion and science \u2014 gave no reason for his abrupt departure. He issued a statement that he\u2019d been honored with a nearly four-decade career at an agency \u201crightfully called the crown jewel of the federal government for decades.\u201d",
      "The $48 billion NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research and has long had strong bipartisan support.",

      "\u201cWhen you hear about patients surviving stage 4 cancer because of immunotherapy, that was based on NIH research over many decades. When you hear about sickle cell disease being cured because of CRISPR gene editing, that was built on many years of research supported by NIH,\u201d Collins wrote.",

      "NEW YORK -- The American Civil Liberties Union is seeking to represent two restaurant workers in a gender identity discrimination lawsuit after a U.S. agency that enforces civil rights laws filed to drop the case in response to President Donald Trump's recent executive order targeting transgender people.",
      "The lawsuit against a Culver\u2019s restaurant in Clarkston, Michigan, is one of seven cases involving gender identity discrimination the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed to dismiss. The EEOC has argued in court filings that pursuing the lawsuits conflicts with Trump's executive order, which declared that the government would only recognize the female and male sexes and ordered federal agencies to take steps to comply.",
      "The EEOC sought to dismiss the lawsuit against Culver's on Monday just four months after filed it following a yearslong investigation. EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas declined to comment on the seven cases the agency is seeking to drop, but in a statement to The Associated Press, she said the EEOC, as an agency of the executive branch, will \u201crobustly will comply with the President\u2019s executive orders.\u201d",
      "The original lawsuit alleges that Culver's fired a transgender man, Asher Lucas, and two female employees, Regina Zaviski and Savannah Nurme-Robinson, after they repeatedly complained to managers that another employee had been harassing and misgendering Lucas. The lawsuit says that managers warned the employee about her behavior but when Lucas, Zaviski and Nurme-Robinson complained that the harassment did not stop, all three were fired.",
      "The ACLU filed a motion to intervene on behalf of Zaviski and Nurme-Robinson on Thursday while Lucas had previously decided to pursue the lawsuit on his own.",
      "\u201cIf this administration does not want to protect the rights of transgender people and their allies, we want them to know that we will,\u201d said Syeda Davidson, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan.",
      "An attorney representing Culver's in the lawsuit did not immediately return an email seeking comment. In court filings, the defendants have denied allegations of discrimination.",
      "Lucas had already filed a motion to intervene \u2014 or pursue his own lawsuit \u2014 in November out of fear that the EEOC would no longer advocate on his behalf after Trump won the presidential election, according his attorney, Angela Mannarino.",
      "Lucas, 21, told The AP that he has kept pursuing his case over the years because he wants to stand up for transgender people and make sure they don't go through what he did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad to be the person who can be able to do that,\u201d he said.",
      "The EEOC's decisions to abandon the seven lawsuits signaled a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law.",
      "Last year, the EEOC updated its guidance to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment. That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Nearly all workplace discrimination charges must pass through the EEOC at least initially. After a lengthy process, workers can seek the right pursue lawsuits on their own from the EEOC but that means they must shoulder the cost of litigation on their own and are deprived of the agency's investigative resources.",
      "Lucas, the acting chair, announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be \u201cdefending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\u201d Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that \u201cimplicate\u201d Trump\u2019s order should be elevated to headquarters for \u201creview.\u201d",
      "In fiscal year 2023, the agency received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.",

      "The graves of hundreds of African American tenant farmers and their families are being moved in Virginia to make way for an industrial park",
      "DANVILLE, Va. -- A decision to move the remains of hundreds African American tenant farmers from a former Virginia tobacco plantation to a dedicated burial ground has elicited a range of emotions among the sharecroppers\u2019 descendants.",
      "Some worry about the implications of disturbing the graves of people who were exploited and enslaved. Others hope the remains can be identified and reburied with more respect than they were afforded in life.",
      "The mostly unidentified remains are being moved from a site that had been part of one of the nation\u2019s largest slave-owning operations, to make way for an industrial park.",
      "When they were buried they weren't considered fully human, but now they are \u201cpatriots who are coming out of their graves with equal rights in 2025,\u201d one descendant, Cedric Hairston, said.",
      "Archaeologists have already started exhuming the approximately 275 plots, and some of the remains of tenant farmers and their families are already in a funeral home but will be moved to the new burial site about a mile away. Officials have been consulting with descendants about genetic testing on unidentified remains as well as designs for the new cemetery, including a memorial archway.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would want their ancestors exhumed or moved,\u201d said Jeff Bennett, whose great-great-great grandfather was buried at the plantation. \u201cBut for them to give us a lot of say so in the new cemetery, down to the design details and the plaques and memorials that we put up, I feel like (they\u2019re) really doing it in a dignified way, in a respectful way.\u201d",
      "African American cemeteries have suffered neglect, abandonment and destruction over the centuries. But efforts to preserve them are gaining momentum, with communities unearthingand rebuilding these crucial links to past generations.",
      "While generally supportive of the project to move the graves, Hairston worries about the indignity of exhuming the graves of people who were brutalized as slaves and exploited as sharecroppers.",
      "\u201cIt just seems that 100 or so odd years after their death, there\u2019s still no rest,\u201d he said.",
      "Oak Hill was part of a family empire that enslaved thousands of people across 45 plantations and farms in four states, according to \u201cThe Hairstons,\u201d a 1999 book by Henry Wiencek that chronicles the Black and white Hairston families.",
      "Samuel Hairston, the plantation's owner, was reputedly the largest enslaver in the South, Wiencek wrote.",
      "But the grand property has stood mostly empty and unused since sharecropping ended last century. The 1820s plantation house was destroyed by fire in 1988.",
      "Many who were enslaved at Oak Hill left after emancipation, Wiencek wrote. Those who remained as tenant farmers were often cheated of wages and faced crushing poverty and sometimes violence in the Jim Crow South.",
      "Some tenant farmers took the Hairston surname, in part because \u201cwe had no other name to identify with, as the government was collecting data for the census. We brought no last name with us from Africa,\u201d Cedric Hairston said, adding, \u201cMany of our women carried and birthed a Hairston child, never with the support of the law to report that they were raped.\u201d",
      "One of the sharecroppers was Fleming Adams Sr., Bennett\u2019s great-great-great grandfather. Known as \u201cFlem,\u201d he was born into slavery on another plantation in 1830. He later worked at Oak Hill, where he had to duck through doorways because he was so tall, Bennett said.",
      "Adams and his wife Martha raised three sons \u2014 George, Daniel and Flem Jr. \u2014 before he died in 1916. His death certificate lists his burial place as Oak Hill.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that we can discover where Flem is,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe was 7 feet tall, so they\u2019d be looking for a bigger coffin. And hopefully there\u2019d be enough of his remains where they could do a DNA sample.\u201d",
      "Most of the graves in the two secluded sharecropper cemeteries were marked only by moss-covered stones without inscriptions. Rows of depressions in the earth showed where the wooden coffins had collapsed below. Needles from loblolly pines covered many of the plots.",
      "A public entity, the Pittsylvania-Danville Regional Industrial Facility Authority, acquired 3,500 acres (1,400 hectares) of land that included the former Oak Hill plantation, and Tennessee-based Microporous announced in November it would build a $1.3 billion battery production facility there. It expects to create 2,000 jobs.",
      "Virginia's Department of Historical Resources granted a permit in late November to move the graves, noting that relocation is consistent with the desires of the descendant families. Bennett and others visited the sites in December.",
      "Silence fell as they walked into the first cemetery. J.D. Adams, an Oak Hill descendant, said a historical marker must be placed there.",
      "\u201cWe need some time in order to determine what it is we want and how we want it,\u201d Adams told Matt Rowe, Pittsylvania County\u2019s economic development director.",
      "Rowe replied: \u201cI\u2019m open to anything and everything.\u201d",
      "The industrial authority has raised $1.3 million from logging the land to fund the project, which is being handled by engineering and consulting company WSP.",
      "WSP's archaeologist, John Bedell, said everything would be collected from each grave shaft, even if it is mostly soil, and transferred to its new space, including the stone that marked it.",
      "The firm hopes to finish transferring the graves by early March. Work on the new burial site and a dedication ceremony will follow in the coming months.",
      "Bennett and others recently viewed personal items found in the graves. Protected in plastic bags, they included eyeglasses, a medicine bottle and a 5-cent coin from 1836. One man was buried with a light bulb, socket and electrical cord. Another man's grave was lined with bricks, indicating he was wealthy, Bennet said.",
      "Those bricks will be repurposed at the new burial site, possibly in the memorial archway, and inscribed with the names of the deceased, he said.",
      "Descendants are reviewing funeral home records to try to identify those buried in unmarked graves. Given the challenging nature of the task, they may inscribe the names of everyone who lived in the area.",
      "\u201cI feel like we're reemphasizing the significance of our ancestors,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt's been generations since people used that area to bury people. And now we're rediscovering their stories. And hopefully we can continue to tell those stories to the next generations.\u201d"

      "Abdisatar Ahmed Hassan, 22, made his first court appearance on a charge of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He was ordered held without bail until a detention hearing March 5.",
      "The chief federal defender for Minnesota, Katherian Roe, said her office will represent him but declined to comment on the case.",
      "The criminal complaint against Hassan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, alleges that he tried twice in December to travel from Minnesota to Somalia to join the group but did not succeed. It says he claimed he was going to visit family but had none there.",
      "Prosecutors said the FBI\u2019s investigation established that Hassan expressed public support for the group in multiple posts on social media and also praised Shamsud-Din Jabbar on TikTok over the New Orleans attack.",
      "Investigators say Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texas native and U.S. Army veteran, posted videos professing allegiance to the Islamic State group and an intent to harm others before he plowed a pickup through a crowd of New Year\u2019s revelers on Bourbon Street on Jan. 1. Police fatally shot him during an exchange of gunfire at the scene.",
      "Hassan also allegedly posted a video last week, of himself driving while holding an Islamic State group flag inside his vehicle. The FBI said it also observed him driving with the flag Wednesday. He was arrested on Thursday.",
      "The charging documents also say police in New York notified the FBI last May that Hassan had made social media posts in support of the Somali group al-Shabab. An affidavit from an agent says investigators spotted al-Shabab and Islamic State group propaganda videos on his TikTok and Facebook accounts. It also alleges that he exchanged messages with a Facebook account that encourages Somali-speaking individuals to travel and fight on behalf of the Islamic State group.",
      "FBI agents were watching when Hassan went to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Dec. 13, authorities say. He allegedly tried to check in for a flight to Somalia but left after an airline employee told him he lacked required travel documents.",
      "He allegedly tried again Dec. 29. Agents saw him board a flight to Chicago, where Customs and Border Protection officers interviewed him extensively before his scheduled flight to Ethiopia but did not detain him. He missed the flight and returned to Minneapolis, the affidavit says.",
      "Hassan is the latest of several Minnesotans suspected of leaving or trying to leave the U.S. to join the Islamic State group in recent years, along with thousands of fighters from other countries. In 2016 nine Minnesota men were sentenced on federal charges of conspiring to join the group, and a Minnesotan who actually fought for the group in Iraq was sentenced last June to 10 years in prison."

      "\u201cLet the 5,000-mile border between Canada and the United States stand as a symbol for the future,\" Reagan said upon signing a 1988 free trade pact with America\u2019s northern neighbor. \"Let it forever be not a point of division but a meeting place between our great and true friends.\u201d",
      "But a point of division is here. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump plans to impose a 25% tariff on most imported Canadian goods and a 10% tariff on Canadian oil and gas. Canada has said it will retaliate with a 25% import tax on a multitude of American products, including wine, cigarettes and shotguns.",
      "The tariffs have touched off a range of emotions along the world\u2019s longest international border, where residents and industries are closely intertwined. Ranchers in Canada rely on American companies for farm equipment, and export cattle and hogs to U.S. meat processors. U.S. consumers enjoy thousands of gallons of Canadian maple syrup each year. Canadian dogs and cats dine on U.S.-made pet food.",
      "The trade dispute will have far-reaching spillover effects, from price increases and paperwork backlogs to longer wait times at the U.S.-Canada border for both people and products, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University.",
      "\u201cThese industries on both sides are built up out of a cross-border relationship, and disruptions will play out on both sides,\u201d Trautman said.",
      "Even the threat of tariffs may have already caused irreparable harm, she said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has urged Canadians to buy Canadian products and vacation at home.",
      "The Associated Press wanted to know what residents and businesses were thinking along the border that Reagan vowed would remain unburdened by an \u201cinvisible barrier of economic suspicion and fear.\u201d Here\u2019s what they said:",

      "Today, Skagway trades on its past, drawing more than 1 million cruise ship passengers a year to a historic downtown that features Klondike-themed museums. But the municipality with a population of about 1,100 still holds deep ties to the Yukon.",
      "Skagway residents frequently travel to Whitehorse, the territory's capital, for a wider selection of groceries and shopping, dental care, veterinary services and swimming lessons. The Alaskan city's port, meanwhile, still supports Yukon mining and is a critical hub for fuel and other essentials both communities need.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a special connection,\u201d Orion Hanson, a contractor and Skagway Assembly member, said of Whitehorse, which sits 110 miles (177 kilometers) north and has 30,000 people. \u201cIt\u2019s really our most accessible neighbor.\u201d",

The lines traverse a continental pivot point -- Montana is the only state with rivers that drain into the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Canada\u2019s Hudson Bay \u2013 and deliver to refineries around Billings.",
      "\u201cCanada is one of our major supply sources for oil across the United States,\u201d said Dallas Scholes, the government affairs director of Houston-based refinery company Par Pacific, which runs a processing facility along the Yellowstone River. \u201cIf tariffs are imposed on the oil and gas industry, \u2026 it\u2019s not going to be good for consumers.\u201d",

      "That means a 10% tax on Canadian energy resources would be felt broadly. The state\u2019s farmers would be among those hit more severely, given the large volumes of gasoline needed to run tractors and other equipment, according to Jeffrey Michael, director of the University of Montana\u2019s Bureau of Business and Economic Research.",
      "\u201cIt will be painful, but there are larger concerns if I were an agricultural producer in Montana,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI\u2019d be worried about the trade war escalating to where my products start to get hit with reciprocal tariffs.\"",

Also unclear is how a separate 25% levy on steel and aluminum that Trump said would take effect starting March 12 factors into the mix.",
      "D\u2019Eramo understands the impulse to strengthen U.S. manufacturing but says the U.S. doesn\u2019t have the capacity to make all the tooling Martinrea would need if it were to shift production there.

Canadians regularly cross one of the four international bridges into the region to shop, go to sporting events and sip Buffalo's beers.",
      "Brewers and other businesses fear there may be less of that, though, if the tariffs on Canada and aluminum go into effect. Trump's repeated comments about making the neighboring nation the 51st U.S. state already offended its citizens - so much so that Buffalo\u2019s tourism agency paused a campaign running in Canada because of negative comments.",

      "The relationship between American and Canadian fishermen can sometimes be fraught, but harvesters on both side of the border know they depend on each other, Drouin said. Maine fishermen catch millions of pounds of lobsters every year, but much of the processing capacity for the valuable crustaceans is in Canada.",
      "If Trump follows through with the threatened tariffs next week, lobsters sent to Canada for processing would be subject to customs duties when they return to the U.S. to go to market. Drouin fears what will happen to the lobster industry if the trade dispute persists and Canada enacts a retaliatory tariff on lobsters.",

      "MIAMI -- A group of American citizens and immigrants is suing the Trump administration for ending a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there's war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.",
      "The lawsuit filed late Friday night seeks to reinstate humanitarian parole programs that allowed in 875,000 migrants from Ukraine, Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who have legal U.S. resident as sponsors.",
      "President Donald Trump has been ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the U.S. and implementing campaign promises to deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The plaintiffs include eight immigrants who entered the U.S. legally before the Trump administration ended what it called the \u201cbroad abuse\u201d of humanitarian parole. They can legally stay in the U.S. until their parole expires, but the administration stopped processing their applications for asylum, visas and other requests that might allow them to remain longer.",
      "None are identified by their real names because they fear deportation. Among them are Maksym and Maria Doe, a Ukrainian couple; Alejandro Doe, who fled Nicaragua following the abduction and torture of his father; and Omar Doe, who worked for more than 18 years with the U.S. military in his home country of Afghanistan.",

They followed the rules,\u201d Kyle Varner, a 40-year-old doctor and real estate investor from Spokane, Washington, who sponsored 79 Venezuelans and is part of the lawsuit, told The Associated Press. \u201cThey have done nothing but work as hard as they can. ... This is just such a grave injustice.\u201d",
      "Almost all of the immigrants sponsored by Varner have lived in his house for some time. He paid their plane tickets. He helped them learn English and get driver\u2019s licenses and jobs. He had 32 applications that were awaiting approval when the Trump administration ended the program in January.",
      "Other plaintiffs include two more U.S. citizens who have sponsored immigrants, Sandra McAnany and Wilhen Pierre Victor, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a California-based organization that assists immigrants with legal advice.",
      "\"The Trump administration is trying to attack parole from all angles,\u201d said Esther Sung, an attorney from the Justice Action Center, which filed the lawsuit with Human Rights First in federal court in Massachusetts and provided the AP a copy in advance. \u201cThe main goal, above all, is to defend humanitarian parole. These have been very, very successful processes.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Parole authority began in 1952 and has been used by Republican and Democratic presidents to admit people unable to use standard immigration routes because of time pressure or because their home country's government lacks diplomatic relations with the U.S.",

      "Thanks to a lack of snow, this year's edition of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race needed a new route across the Alaska wilderness. The course change adds more than 100 miles (161 kilometers), so teams of dogs will have to pull their mushers over 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) to the finish line.",
      "The number of mushers participating this year is down from previous years, and tied with 2023 as an all-time low. This year is the fourth time the starting line has moved to Fairbanks due to barren ground near Anchorage or elsewhere on the trail.",
      "Here's a by-the-numbers look at the grueling event, which begins with a ceremonial start in Anchorage on Saturday, followed by the start of the race in Fairbanks on Monday. The winning team is expected in the Gold Rush town of Nome about 10 days later.",
      "Only 33 mushers will start this year\u2019s race, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever.",
      "The largest field ever was 96 mushers in 2008.",
      "This drop in participants raises concerns about the viability of the iconic race, which has suffered from inflation, pressure from animal rights groups and climate change.",
      "The first Iditarod was held in 1973, making this year\u2019s race the 53rd.",
      "The inaugural event had 34 mushers start the race, only one more than the smallest fields in 2023 and 2025.",
      "Sled dogs were once the main form of transportation in Alaska. Dog teams hauled freight, brought people to other villages and even provided transport for the Alaska Territorial Guard, or the famed Eskimo Scouts, which patrolled the western coast against Japanese attack in World War II.",
      "Dog teams were supplanted by snowmobiles in the 1960s, but interest was growing to honor Alaska\u2019s traditions as the 100th anniversary of its purchase by the U.S. from Russia neared in 1967.",
      "Dorothy Page and Joe Redington Sr. conceived the idea of a long-distance race to honor the Iditarod Trail, a freight-and-mail route from Seward to Nome, which eventually led to the first Iditarod.",
      "This year the Iditarod will honor another famous route: the 1925 Serum Run, in which sled dog teams saved Nome from a deadly diphtheria outbreak.",
      "That\u2019s a lot of dogs.",
      "Each musher must have at least a dozen dogs to start the race, but throughout the course, they can have up to 16, meaning there could be up to 528 canines on the trail.",
      "It won\u2019t be that crowded in Anchorage, however. Mushers are limited to eight dogs each for the ceremonial start, or a total of 264 tail-waggers.",
      "The Iditarod is typically called a 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race as mushers and their dogs battle the most challenging elements an Alaska winter can throw at them.",
      "However, that mileage has always been approximate.",
      "Organizers alternate between different routes most years to allow more villages in rural Alaska to serve as checkpoints. In odd-numbered years, the race goes 998 miles (1,606 kilometers) along the southern route. In even-numbered years, the race\u2019s mileage drops to 975 miles (1,569 kilometers) on the northern route.",
      "This year's event will set a record for the longest Iditarod: 1,128 miles (1,815 kilometers). Organizers had to reroute competitors around a stretch of trail without snow.",
      "A lack of snow this winter in the state's largest city also has curtailed the ceremonial start. Usually the teams course through 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) of Anchorage streets. This year, it's less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers).",
      "The Iditarod\u2019s four-legged athletes will go through a total of about 100,000 booties during the race. They help protect the dogs\u2019 paws from snow, ice and frigid temperatures.",
      "Mushers pack supplies they will need during the race but can't carry. The supplies, including about 180,000 pounds (81,647 kilograms) of dog food, are delivered to checkpoints ahead of the race."

      "That was back when gestures of bipartisanship and appeals to national unity were still in the mix on the night the president comes before Congress to hold forth on the state of the union. Trump, then new at the job, was just getting his footing in the halls of power and not ready to stomp on everything.",
      "It would be three more years before Americans would see Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, then the House speaker and his State of the Union host in the chamber, performatively rip up a copy of Trump\u2019s speech in disgust over its contents.",
      "On Tuesday, Americans who tune into Trump's address will see whether he speaks to the whole country, as he mostly did in his first such speech in the chamber as president, or only to the roughly half who voted for him.",
      "They will see also whether he hews to ceremony and common courtesies, as he did in 2017, or goes full bore on showmanship and incitement.",
      "He comes into it days after assailing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face and before the cameras in the Oval Office for not expressing sufficient gratitude for U.S. support in Ukraine's war with Russia. It was a display of public humiliation by an American president to an allied foreign leader with no parallel in anyone's memory.",
      "Jarrett Borden, walking to lunch on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, Florida, this past week, expressed ambivalence about Trump, having heard a lot of \u201chogwash\u201d from him even while liking some of what he has done. Borden anticipates a good show Tuesday and will watch.",
      "\u201cI want to see if he\u2019s going to leave the mic open for Elon Musk, like it\u2019s an open mic at a club or something,\" he said, citing the billionaire architect of Trump's civil service purge. \"This is what he\u2019s been doing recently, which is comical.\u201d",
      "In Philadelphia, visual artist Nova Villanueva will spend Tuesday evening doing something \u2014 anything \u2014 else. She is into avoiding politics and social media altogether these fraught days.",
      "\u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of sad,\u201d she said. \"It\u2019s almost like I have to be ignorant to be at peace with myself and my life right now.\u201d",
      "A new president's first speech to Congress is not designated a State of the Union address, coming so close to the Jan. 20 inauguration. But it serves the same purpose, offering an annual accounting of what has been done, what is ahead and what condition the country is in, as the president sees it.",
      "It is customary in modern times for the president to say the state of the union is strong, no matter what a mess it may be in. Trump won the election saying the state of the union was in shambles and he was going to make it right.",
      "The Trump who addressed Congress on Feb. 28, 2017, is recognizable now, despite the measured tone and content of that speech. After all, he had already shocked the political class by assailing \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d from the inaugural stage.",
      "He told Congress that night he wanted NATO members to spend more on their armed forces, wanted trade to be \u201cfair\u201d as well as free, and wanted foreign countries in crises to be made stable enough so that people who fled to the U.S. could go back home. But he did not open his first term with the wrenching turns in foreign policy, civil service firings, stirrings of mass deportation or cries of \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d of today.",
      "In a line that could have come from any president of either party, Trump noted in his 2017 speech that, \u201cwith the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\u201d",
      "Now he belittles Trudeau as \u201cgovernor\u201d of a land he wants to make the 51st state and is about to slam with tariffs, along with Mexico. Canadians, not known for displays of patriotism, are seething about their neighbor and rushing to buy and fly their flag.",
      "In Philadelphia, small-time entrepreneur Michael Mangraviti cannot help but take some satisfaction in Trump's scouring of the bureaucracy as the firings pile up with scant regard for how well people did their jobs or how those jobs helped keep services to the public running.",
      "\u201cHe said for years and years, \u2018Drain the swamp, drain the swamp,\u2019\u201d Mangraviti said. \u201cBut, you know, now is the time to actually drain the swamp.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen time and time and time again that the government is horribly, horribly ineffective at everything it wants to do,\u201d he went on. \"The fact that they\u2019re actually taking action on something that they say they\u2019re going to do, the fact that they\u2019re ready to take the ax and take it to our government, is something I appreciate.\u201d",
      "To Cassandra Piper, a Philadelphia instrumentalist, Trump's move to stop making pennies was a \u201cfine decision\" \u2014 unlike everything else he has said and done.",
      "\u201cI comprehensively disapprove of the changes that are being made,\" Piper said, stopping to speak while walking by the Liberty Bell Center. \u201cNot that I was all too happy with the status quo beforehand in the first place, but there\u2019s absolutely no good that can come from the inhumanity of mass deportation, something that this country has already been scarred by.\u201d",
      "So, too, with Trump's selection of vaccination skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and his choice of Musk to lead the effort to \u201ceffectively plunder the government of its resources,\u201d in Piper's view.",
      "In Hollywood, Florida, Borden, who is Black, said that to the extent Trump can take money that Washington spends overseas and pump it into the U.S. economy, \u201cthen you are making America great again. But do that without the racial overtones. Do that without the negative energy, and we\u2019re going to be OK.\"",
      "\u201cI think the world is just the world, and we should all just love each other,\u201d he said.",
      "Abraham Lincoln might have agreed, as he summoned the \u201cbetter angels of our nature\u201d in an inaugural speech, a month before the Civil War, that pleaded with Americans not to \u201cbreak our bonds of affection.\"",
      "Trump had something to say on that subject, too, in 2017: \u201cWe all bleed the same blood.\u201d",

      "A Mississippi judge has nixed her order that a newspaper remove its editorial criticizing local officials",
      "A Mississippi judge on Wednesday vacated her order that a newspaper remove its editorial criticizing local officials, days after a city decided to drop the lawsuit that spurred it.",
      "The judge's order had been widely condemned by free speech advocates as a clear violation of the paper's First Amendment rights.",
      "Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin had issued the restraining order against the Clarksdale Press Register last week, telling it to remove from its website a Feb. 8 editorial titled \u201cSecrecy, Deception Erode Public Trust.\u201d The piece criticized the city for not sending the newspaper notice about a meeting the board held regarding a proposed tax on alcohol, marijuana and tobacco.",
      "The board of commissioners dropped the suit Monday at the request of Mayor Chuck Espy, who cited an offer from the paper's owner to run a clarification. However, Emmerich Newspapers president Wyatt Emmerich said he made that offer before the city filed its lawsuit and that it was no longer on the table.",
      "Emmerich had offered to clarify that the council said the lack of notification wasn\u2019t a deliberate attempt to hide the meeting, according to a text message Emmerich sent to the city attorney.

    "story": [
      "The latest increase in rail fares in England and Wales is set to pile \"further misery on hard-pressed households\", a campaign group has said.",
      "From Sunday, regulated rail fares in England and Wales have risen by 4.6% and the price of most railcards has increased by \u00a35.",
      "The government says fares need to rise so it can invest in the rail system, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged passengers were \"frustrated\" by delays and cancellations.",
      "The Campaign for Better Transport said people were being \"priced off the railways\" by fare increases.",
      "The rail fare rise for regulated tickets includes most season tickets covering commuter routes in England, which can cost thousands of pounds.",
      "Some off-peak returns on long-distance journeys, and flexible tickets for travelling in and around cities will also rise.",
      "Train operators set their own prices for unregulated fares, but these tend to increase by a similar amount to regulated fares, including on lines that have already been renationalised.",
      "About 45% of train fares are regulated in England, Wales and Scotland, but the 4.6% rise relates to travel in England and Wales only.",
      "In Scotland, rail fares are set to increase by 3.8% in April.",
      "In Northern Ireland, the nationalised Translink service said no decision had yet been taken by the Department for Infrastructure on whether rail fares will go up in 2025.",
      "The cost of most railcards has also gone up by about \u00a35, from about \u00a330, but disabled railcards remain the same price.",
      "The Campaign for Better Transport said the fare increases would add to the pressure on households, coming on top of higher food and energy costs.",
      "Michael Solomon Williams, head of campaigns at the group, said high ticket prices were the \"number one barrier to getting more people travelling by rail\", and called on the government to bring down fares as part of rail reforms.",
      "\"People are being hit hard,\" he told the BBC. \"People want to take the train and they're being priced off the railways.",
      "\"At the same time fuel duty's being frozen. Government has the choice, it can choose to intervene.\"",

      "\"The cost is prohibitive,\" he says.",
      "\"I would happily take the train, but for over four times the cost? I could have a week's holiday for that money.\"",
      "But Celia Downie, who uses the train regularly for work and leisure, says she will continue to do so \"however much it costs\", because \"I can work on the train and I believe it is environmentally proper to do so\".",
      "But the 68-year-old from Bristol, who has a Senior Railcard, also believes prices are too high for families and says sometimes the experience of cramped carriages is \"absolutely appalling\".",
      "'Not fit for purpose'",

      "It is setting up a new arms-length body, Great British Railways (GBR), to take over service contracts currently held by private firms as they expire in the coming years.",
      "Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said price increases showed that Labour's pledges to make rail fares cheaper were \"meaningless\" and commuters were instead facing \"chaos, confusion and cancellation\" on the railways.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly44dknrj8o",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:25:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it",
    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",
      "But this government has staked its reputation on overcoming opposition to projects that it believes will boost growth, indicating it wants to see airport expansion despite the objections.",

      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

    "story": [
      "Skype, the video-calling service that had hundreds of millions of users, is closing in May, its owner Microsoft has said.",
      "It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free.",
      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",
      "In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.",
      "Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News.",
      "First released in 2003, Skype was bought by the tech giant in 2011 for $8.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) - its biggest-ever acquisition at the time.",
      "As Microsoft once outlined, Skype became integrated with the company's other products such as Xbox and Windows devices.",
      "In December 2010, tech industry commentator Om Malik called it one of the \"key applications of the modern web\", when the website suffered a two-day global outage.",
      "'It felt like magic'",
      "Following news of its imminent closure, Skype users past and present described their memories of using the service for video calls and the impact it had on their lives.",
      "\"My best friend and I share many good memories on Skype,\" one X user said. \"This is a sad day and almost a feeling of losing yet another fragment of my adolescence.\"",
      "Another early user of Skype called Louise told the BBC she and her partner used the service to chat when they \"embarked on a transatlantic relationship\".",
      "\"Skype was such an exciting invention at the time - before smartphones and WhatsApp calls,\" she said.",
      "\"It's so easy to assume that we've always been able to freely talk to people across the world but that's such a recent development really.\"",
      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:06:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.",
      "The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.",
      "The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.",
      "If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.",
      "\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.",
      "Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process.",
      "The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.",
      "Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.",
      "On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".",
      "The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.",
      "An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.",
      "Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".",
      "Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.",
      "It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.",
      "But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.",
      "Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. \"The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,\" he added.",
      "Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.",
      "\"People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,\" he added.",
      "Union Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\".",
      "Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be \"a win for everyone\".",

      "\"We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,\" she said.",
      "The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.",
      "Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.",
      "On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.",
      "Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released.",
      "But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.",
      "The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights.",
      "Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.",
      "China's ministry of foreign affairs said it \"strongly\" expressed its \"dissatisfaction and resolute opposition\" to the plans.",
      "Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March.",
      "Trump's comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan.",
      "Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.",
      "He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.",
      "On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.",
      "\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\"",
      "She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\".",
      "Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.",
      "Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.",
      "Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.",
      "China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.",
      "Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.",
      "Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.",
      "A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Lin Jian, said that Trump was using the issue of the drug fentanyl entering the US from China as an \"excuse\" to threaten tariffs, adding it had one of the \"strictest\" drug control policies in the world.",
      "\"Pressure, coercion, and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,\" he said.",
      "Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, had earlier said that his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.",
      "\"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\".",
      "\"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University.",
      "On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.",
      "Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.",
      "Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.",
      "Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.",
      "Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.",
      "\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said.",
      "The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.",
      "But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.",
      "China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.",
      "Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy."

      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has said the water sector in England and Wales \"urgently needs fixing\".",
      "Reed has ruled out nationalisation, saying it would cost up to \u00a3100bn, and that waterways would continue to be polluted while private ownership structures were unpicked.",
      "Instead, the government wants private investment to upgrade the sewerage system and reservoirs.",
      "To get that, regulator Ofwat has allowed the water industry to raise bills, which will go up by an average of \u00a3123 a year from April.",
      "There were 3.6 million hours of sewage spills into England's lakes, rivers and seas by water companies in 2023, which is more than double the amount of the previous year.",
      "Sir Jon said there were \"serious\" and \"interlocking concerns\" with the sector which need \"ambitious changes\", and acknowledged that \"trust in the system\" had \"broken down on all sides\".",

      "Sir Jon is expected to recognise the widespread dissatisfaction at multiple failings and will seek submissions from regulators, investors, industry leaders and the public on potential reforms.",
      "He will acknowledge the tensions between different regulators, the increasing demands place on the system by climate and population growth, and making the sector attractive to private investors.",
      "Sir Jon told the BBC the commission's report would be \"as radical as we need to be to reset the system\".",
      "The plight of Thames Water has been one of the most high-profile issues in the sector, with the company struggling with about \u00a319bn of debt.",
      "It recently won a crucial High Court battle to secure a \u00a33bn rescue loan, staving off the prospect of the company coming under government control.",
      "Sir Jon's review comes as six companies - including Thames - are appealing against decisions by Ofwat to limit bill increases over the next five years.",
      "The commission's report, expected in June, will not affect that process.",
      "Sir Jon said regulation of the water sector would be a \"key area\" that the commission will examine.",
      "\"Regulation needs to balance the cost to the bill payers with the needs of investment, not just to ensure that we've got supply of clean water for the future, but also investment to protect the environment.",
      "\"There is probably a bigger role for government, both at the national and at the local level, for giving guidelines for how those priorities should be managed,\" he added.",
      "To try to make companies more accountable, the government has brought in a law which gives regulators the power to ban bonuses for water company bosses.",

      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are due to go up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming in April.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are set to rise by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",

      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will go up \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",

      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, based on the inflation rate last December, plus an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",

    "summary": "The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has made headlines by pulling its most advanced data security tool for UK customers.",
      "It is removing Advanced Data Protection (ADP) after the Home Office asked for the right to be able to access data which it is applied to - something even Apple itself cannot currently do.",
      "Rather than comply with that request, on Friday the tech giant said it would halt new UK sign-ups to the tool and remove existing user access at a later date.",
      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "Items including back-ups, photos, notes and voice memos are given standard encryption by default.",
      "The company can be ordered to hand over this data by law enforcement.",
      "ADP, meanwhile, applies an extra level of protection through what's known as end to end encryption, which means Apple cannot see or access the data - only the user can.",
      "Because Apple does not have a key, losing access to your account can mean losing your data altogether.",
      "It also means law enforcement agencies have no way of accessing such data either.",
      "The tool is independent of the protections for blue messages sent with iMessage, passwords stored in iCloud keychain, Health app data and Facetime, which are end to end encrypted by default.",
      "What does this mean for my iCloud data?",
      "If you are in the UK and have not turned on ADP, you will not see a change to the way your data is protected as a result of Apple disabling it.",
      "Your iCloud data will remain protected by standard encryption and, as before, can still be accessed by Apple.",
      "But it does mean you now cannot apply to protect iCloud storage with end to end encryption, even if you want to.",
      "Meanwhile, people in the UK who had ADP enabled prior to Friday's change will lose access to it a later date.",
      "Apple has not said when, nor how many UK users will be affected.",
      "Some experts have raised alarm over its removal, saying it will leave users less protected and also have wider, global consequences.",
      "Graeme Stewart of cybersecurity firm Check Point said it would not mean \"a complete free-for-all\" as law enforcement must have a warrant to request iCloud data.",
      "But he said other governments may look to replicate the UK's demand of Apple for a so-called \"backdoor\" to encrypted cloud data.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have likened the idea of creating a backdoor to someone leaving their house keys under their doormat - essentially creating a vulnerability which anyone, including bad actors, can exploit.",
      "Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that if Apple had complied with the request, it would have created a backdoor not just for UK users \"but for people around the world, regardless of where they were or what citizenship they had\".",
      "Apple told the BBC in a statement that it had \"never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will\".",
      "What protections do Google and Android offer?",
      "Like Apple, Google says it uses standard encryption across a range of its services to protect data as it moves between users' devices, its services and data centres.",
      "The search giant, which owns Android, has provided further protections for Android phone system back-ups since 2018.",
      "It uses a mechanism that generates a random security key on a device, which is encrypted by a user's lock-screen passcode, pattern or pin.",
      "Google says it cannot see this security key and that the passcode-protected information is sent securely to high security chips in its data centres.",
      "But the same protections do not extend to Google Photos or content stored in Google Drive - which are not end to end encrypted.",
      "It also has an Advanced Protection Program for people who want further security for their account.",
      "This relies on using passkeys to verify the account holder.",
      "Some Samsung Galaxy smartphones also have \"enhanced data protection\" which encrypts back-ups of messages, call logs, apps and settings and more end to end.",

      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",

      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",

      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",

      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",

      "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.",
      "We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.",
      "What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.",
      "A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.",
      "\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.",
      "Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.",
      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",
      "\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"",
      "However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.",
      "Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.",
      "His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.",
      "He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.",
      "\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.",
      "Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.",
      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",
      "Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

    "story": [
      "Children from poor households should be enrolled for free school meals automatically to prevent thousands going hungry, a report by MPs has found.",
      "The education select committee called for the change \"without delay\", warning that pupils who should be fed free of cost are missing out because their parents have not signed up to the scheme.",
      "As of June 2024, around 2.1 million children were known to be eligible for free school meals in England - nearly a quarter of pupils.",
      "A Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said the government \"welcomed\" the proposals and would carefully consider the recommendations.",
      "In England, families are eligible to apply for free school meals if they are on universal credit and have a household income below \u00a37,400 per year, after tax, alongside other benefits.",
      "However, the committee heard evidence from an expert who estimated that one in 10 children in poverty are not receiving the meals.",
      "Earlier this month, Kate Antsey, of the Child Poverty Action Group, told MPs that it was often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process experienced by their parents.",
      "Another estimate published in April 2024 by the think tank Policy in Practice put the number of children needlessly missing out on free school meals at 471,000.",
      "The cross-party education committee said the government should change the current rules using the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - to remove the need for manual enrolment.",
      "Failing to address the issue would be a \"missed opportunity\" to feed hungry children at school, the report concluded.",
      "It added that low uptake of free school meals contributes to hunger at school for children living with deprivation.",
      "The MPs also accused the government of rushing the bill through the House of Commons \"at the expense of time for proper scrutiny\".",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called it a \"landmark\" bill to \"seek to keep children safe\".",
      "It includes plans for all children to have a unique identifier number, a bit like a National Insurance number, for safeguarding purposes.",
      "It also includes other wide-ranging proposals, such as universal free breakfast clubs in all primary schools, and changes to academy schools' powers.",
      "Some of its proposals - particularly around academies - have been criticised, including by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who called it educational \"vandalism\".",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders' union NAHT, agreed with the committee's calls for auto-enrolment for free school meals, adding: \"Too often social stigma means parents do not register.",
      "\"Crucially, enrolment for free school meals also unlocks pupil premium money for pupils, so without registration they also miss out on this vital additional support.\"",
      "Campaigners say automatic enrolment would also bring in millions in extra funding for schools via pupil premium grants.",
      "The government pays schools \u00a31,455 per primary pupil on free school meals or \u00a31,035 per secondary pupil, per year, for at least six years.",
      "Other recommendations in the report include ensuring that children with special educational needs and disabilities can access universal free breakfast clubs, strengthening the access of children in care to mental health support, and developing a national care offer.",
      "Education committee chairwoman Helen Hayes said: \"The committee has made recommendations designed to strengthen support for the most vulnerable children in society, based on compelling evidence from experts and from young people who shared with us their deeply moving experiences of life in care.\"",
      "The committee called on the government to develop a consistent national offer for care leavers across the country, to support vulnerable young people with things like transport costs and access to apprenticeships.",
      "The DfE said the \"landmark\" schools bill would break the \"unfair link between background and opportunity\".",
      "\"Despite the challenging inherited fiscal context, we are introducing landmark measures to support family finances, including rolling out free breakfast clubs in every primary school and capping the number of branded uniform items parents have to pay for, as well as prioritising reform across children's social care.\"",

      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",

      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",

      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",
      "However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.",
      "The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.",
      "\"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said.",
      "He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx04vrlqn0o",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 04:48:18 GMT",
    "summary": "From Jade's problematic dress, to Stormzy's eye injury - here's what really went down at the Brits.",
    "story": [
      "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.",
      "Charli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.",
      "US star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.",
      "But no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.",
      "Most predictable winner: Charli XCX",
      "Listen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night.",
      "The pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.",
      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",
      "\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.",
      "\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"",
      "Best visual pun: This coat",
      "Teddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.",
      "Least practical dress: Jade Thirlwall",
      "Jade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all.",
      "As well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.",
      "Over the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.",
      "Sneakiest host: Jack Whitehall",
      "Jack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.",
      "As ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.",
      "\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.",
      "Later, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".",
      "\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"",
      "Speaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.",
      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",
      "\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"",

      "One of Jade Thirlwall's dancers mooned at the camera.",

      "I'd guess that ITV's responses to Ofcom are going to make an interesting read.",

      "As fans applauded, the singer grimaced: \"They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.\"",
      "Most criticised industry: The music industry",
      "The Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.",
      "But lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.",
      "\"Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments - because moments fade and careers take time,\" said Myles Smith. \"So please stick with artists past a viral hit.\"",
      "Chappell Roan, who won best international artist, had a similar plea.",
      "\"I had to write a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones - and artists deserve that freedom, to explore horrible concepts, and to flop, and rise, and not be pressured into making music based off of what's trending.\"",
      "Charli XCX's multiple victories proved their point. Signed at the age of 14, she had to fight to make the music she wanted - after years of being told her songs were too abrasive and uncommercial.",
      "\"It feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven't made any sacrifices,\" she said.",

      "Asked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.",

      "Sabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of bearskin-wearing guards and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.",
      "But was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.",

      "",
      "Best speech: Ezra Collective",
      "Ezra Collective made history by becoming the first jazz band to win the Brit Award for best group - beating previous title-holders like Coldplay, The Cure and Bring Me The Horizon.",
      "Taking to the stage, frontman Femi Koleoso had a few words to say about cuts to music education, and the lack of funding for youth clubs like Tomorrow's Warriors - where his band got their start.",
      "\"I'll bang this drum a bunch of times and I'll continue to do so until the entire country gets it\", he said.",
      "\"This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music.",
      "\"The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK...  we're unsure of how to fix it, but the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies in giving a young person a saxophone.",
      "\"Because when you do that, you give them a dream, an aspiration and a goal.\"",
      "To prove his point, he invited the London youth group Kinetika Bloco onto the stage of the O2, to blast through Ezra Collective's infectiously upbeat jazz anthem Shaking Body.",

      "This year's Brit Award trophies, designed by Gabriel Moses, were cast in bronze... And they were heavy.",
      "Weighing 1.6kg each, you could break a toe if you dropped one. And Charli had to pick up four of the things for her winner's photo.",
      "It took approximately six people to arrange them in her arms (\"don't push them between my boobs\", she squealed at one point) before she was ready for the flashbulbs.",
      "\"Is this lame?\" she asked at the last moment. \"It feels lame.\"",

      "The family of pop star Liam Payne have criticised the media for causing \"indescribable, lasting damage\" through its coverage of his death.",
      "In a statement released on Sunday morning, the family said that persistent \"attention and speculation\" in the press had exacerbated their suffering, and that of Payne's young son, Bear, in particular.",
      "\"The family has always wished for privacy to grieve and asks that they be given the space and time to do so,\" they added.",
      "Payne died last October after falling from a balcony at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. He was 31 years old.",

Instead, Bear has lost his father, Geoff and Karen have lost their son, Ruth and Nicola have lost their brother and all of Liam's friends and fans have lost someone they held very dear.",
      "\"We understand that the investigation into Liam's death was absolutely necessary, and the family recognises the work done by the Argentinian authorities.  However, the family accepts the Court of Appeal's decision to drop all charges.",

      "The night also included a memorable, blush-inducing performance from US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter, who was handed the global success award at London's O2 Arena.",
      "The arena fell silent near the end of the show for a moving video tribute to the late Liam Payne, who died last October.",
      "The year of the Brat",
      "Despite not performing, Charli XCX stole the show by winning the biggest awards of the night - artist of the year, album of the year for her cultural phenomenon Brat, and song of the year for Guess.",
      "\"This is cool, I'm really happy that a song about underwear now has a Brit award, very important stuff\", said Charli, dryly, on stage after collecting her first award.",
      "\"I'm sure that that proves something about songwriting but I'm not sure what.\"",
      "She went on to thank Eilish - the first non-Brit to appear on a best song-winner - for her guest vocals on Guess which she delivered at just three days notice. \"Thank you Billie for running and gunning...\"",

      "In her speech for best dance act, she spoke of the importance of the night-time genre. \"I feel like dance music, electronic music gets a really bad rep' because everyone is like, 'it's not that deep, is it?'. And I kind of feel it is,\" she said.",
      "\"This genre of music for me is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"",
      "As she collected her fifth and final award of the night for best album, Charli told the crowd how she had \"always felt like an outsider\" up until this point.",
      "\"Culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us - I am living proof that it takes a long time but you don't need to compromise your vision,\" she added.",
      "Sabrina rules the Brits",
      "It's always difficult getting the tone of the opening performance right - but Carpenter certainly nailed the brief with her mash-up of mega-hit Espresso and recent favourite from her best-selling album, Bed Chem.",
      "Fans of the star who have been eagerly following her Short n' Sweet Tour will have recognised some elements of it in her Brits performance - which was given a suitably British update with the opening strains of Rule, Britannia! and a, ahem, close encounter with a red-coated, bearskin-wearing \"soldier\".",
      "Carpenter also became the first international star to accept the returning global success award, jokingly saying it was \"an insane honour, for such a tea-drinking country you streamed the [heck] out of Espresso.\"",
      "Wearing some lingerie that might have been a little bit too racy for the pre-watershed slot, her performance around a heart-shaped bed was energetic and embodied her cheeky style that has elevated her fame in recent months.",
      "Best pop act winner, Jade - of Little Mix fame - attempted to top this with a performance of her song Angel Of My Dreams.",
      "In it she appeared in a blonde wig and big white fur coat before disappearing briefly somewhere in a crowd of dancers and re-emerging as an angel suspended above the stage.",
      "Protecting artists and spaces",
      "Several artists used their winning platform to urge the powers-that-be to do more to protect artists and give them the time, space and funds to develop.",
      "Jazz group Ezra Collective - who closed the night with an upbeat performance alongside Jorja Smith - won group of the year, with Femi Koleoso expressing that giving a young person at a youth club a trumpet, for example, could help to fix \"so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK\".",
      "Chappell Roan, who won best international act and international song for Good Luck, Babe!, noted via a video link how she had to write \"a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones\".",
      "Rising star winner Myles Smith - or \"The Luton Bob Dylan\", as host Jack Whitehall called him - performed his hit Stargazing and called on the government to stop treating British music as an \"after thought\". \"How many more venues need to close?\" he asked, before urging the music industry itself to stick with artists past their first viral hits and tours.",

      "It's four years since Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards - with Mo Gilligan filling the gap - and he noted how broadcasters ITV \"had to come crawling back to an ex\" in asking him back.",
      "He poked fun at the stars in the audience, underlining how Charli, in true British style, \"had asked not to perform on the show so she can get drunk\".",
      "And referencing Stormzy's recent high profile adverts, he called the star \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald - he's loving it\".",
      "Aiming one of many light digs at YouTuber KSI, the host joked: \"You are as good a rapper as Aitch... from Steps\".",

      "Tributes paid to Liam Payne",
      "Liam Payne, who tragically died in Argentina aged 31, had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist.",
      "The ceremony included a touching tribute to the star, which was a bit of a gear shift towards the end of the fun-packed show, as Whitehall queued up a sombre black and white montage of Payne's career, including music and quotes from him and his bandmates.",
      "\"I hope that me singing today brings enjoyment to someone,\" he was heard saying.",
      "Seven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa won nothing on the night despite having received four nominations.",

      "Wicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.",
      "US comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).",
      "You can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Here are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.",
      "Which films are in the running?",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).",
      "It is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken.",
      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).",
      "However, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.",
      "Chasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.",
      "Wicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.",
      "Meanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.",
      "All the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "The film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.",
      "But there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.",
      "What else is there to look out for?",
      "This has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.",
      "In the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.",
      "But it's a tight race.",

      "This is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.",
      "Best actor may also be up in the air. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "Last week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.",
      "In the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "10 years since #OscarsSoWhite",
      "It's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.",
      "This year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.",

      "Most of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.",
      "There had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "Presenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.",
      "What impact have the wildfires had?",
      "This year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.",
      "The nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.",
      "There's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.",
      "Cancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.",
      "She told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.",
      "\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.",
      "Who is performing?",
      "This year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.",
      "Instead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "I can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.",
      "Who is this year's host?",

      "\"He loved being an actor, and hated all the stuff that surrounds being an actor.\"",
      "That, for film director Barry Sonnenfeld, is how he'll remember Gene Hackman, who has died at the age of 95.",
      "The endless hours in hair and makeup, repeated takes, and studio notes all frustrated Hackman, Sonnenfeld told BBC News.",
      "So too did actors who showed up not knowing their lines - notably John Travolta, who Hackman clashed with on the set of 1995 film Get Shorty, which Sonnenfeld directed.",
      "In the days since the news of Hackman's death, I've been speaking to people here in Los Angeles and beyond, who, like Sonnenfeld, knew and worked with him.",
      "What's immediately clear is how seriously Hackman took acting, and how meticulously he dealt with scripts.",
      "But what's also clear is that he was wary of the trappings of Hollywood.",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, died alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog at his home in New Mexico. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February, 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "'He put the fear of God into me'",
      "In LA, Hackman's face is everywhere on television bulletins and on newspapers.",
      "His death was all anyone was talking about as stars gathered for pre-Oscars parties.",
      "I was at one of those events on Thursday night, where the American actor John C Reilly told me that he expected the Academy to commemorate Hackman on Sunday. \"I don't see how you could have the Oscars without mentioning a great like him who's passed.\"",
      "For Sonnenfeld and for the Irish director John Moore \u2013 who directed Hackman in 2001's Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 it was Hackman's way of dealing with scripts that demonstrated his brilliance. He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"So he had unique cut and pasted scripts that had no information from the writer about anything, because he wanted to make those choices, not the writer.\"",
      "Moore recalls a similar incident from the very first time he filmed with Hackman.",
      "\"He was just quietly sitting there, taking script pages out, cutting them up, removing extraneous stuff like scene descriptions, and then sticking them back onto blank pages,\" he said.",
      "He said Hackman told him: \"Acting is my job, you do the rest.\"",
      "\"It put the fear of God into me,\" Moore said, laughing.",
      "\"It was essentially him saying: 'I don't need anything, as I'm that good. You better bring your A-game, as I'm bringing mine.'\"",
      "It wasn't just superfluous studio notes that bothered Hackman.",
      "\"He had this conflict in that he was this brilliant actor but he hated the tropes of what it took to act in movies,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "\"[He] hated putting on makeup. The putting on of wardrobe. The wardrobe person after takes, taking their lip brush and rubbing down their wardrobe. The makeup person recombing his hair while he's talking to me,\" he said.",
      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",
      "Nor did he often want to socialise after filming, said Moore.",
      "\"I'd try and have a drink with him after we'd shoot, and go up to the minibar,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd have one, that was it. [Betsy] would give him that look, and off it would be to bed. And he was in great shape in the morning as a result.\"",
      "\"For Gene, it was all about the acting,\" added Sonnenfeld. \"End of story. Get me out of here as fast as possible.\"",

      "Hackman responded: \"Nothing except learn the lines,\" to which Travolta replied, \"Well that's a waste of a weekend,\" according to Sonnenfeld.",
      "As filming went on, Hackman grew \"angrier and angrier\" at his co-star not knowing his lines.",
      "Sonnenfeld said he let Hackman take out his rage on him.",

      "Miranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.",

      "When she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.",
      "\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.",
      "They \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.",
      "We've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.",
      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:16:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Fallout from the film about Gaza's children is a reputationally damaging mess, says the BBC's media editor Katie Razzall.",
    "story": [
      "As guests sat down on the red cinema-style seats in the screening room of a plush central London hotel, nobody could have imagined that, less than a month later,  the BBC would find itself forced to apologise for serious and unacceptable flaws in the documentary that was about to be shown.",
      "In the darkness, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone unfolded over an hour, telling in bleak and upsetting detail the story of Gaza's children over recent months of the war.",
      "Screenings are standard practice for media companies, primarily for outside press to review a programme ahead of broadcast.",
      "Also in the room was BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and other senior executives from the BBC's news and current affairs to view what one described as a \"landmark\" piece of filmmaking.",
      "But after the programme went out on BBC Two, it emerged that the child narrator at the heart of the film, 13-year old Abdullah, was the son of a Hamas government official. The outcry and accusations of anti-Israel bias and lack of transparency led the BBC to pull the film from iPlayer.",
      "Questions were asked in Parliament.",
      "'Fell short of expectations'",
      "Criticism continued about the programme's subtitling choices \u2013 including contributors using the Arabic word for \"Jews\" on camera, which was translated in the subtitles as \"Israelis\" or \"Israeli army\". Some argue that the BBC covered up antisemitism. Others have claimed the subtitles are closer to what the speaker intends rather than a literal translation.",
      "After an initial investigation, the BBC said the programme, which had been commissioned by the BBC and made by an outside production company, \"fell short of our expectations\".",
      "It launched a further review headed by the director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston. He will look at whether editorial guidelines were broken and whether anyone should be disciplined.",
      "It's a reputationally damaging mess, but how could it have happened? How did the commissioners of the programme not know that the child narrator's father was a deputy minister for agriculture in the Hamas-run government?",
      "The BBC says it had asked the production company \"a number of times\" in writing during the making of the film about any connections he and his family might have with Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation by the US, UK and others.",
      "In a statement on Thursday the BBC said Hoyo Films, the maker of the film, acknowledged it \"never told the BBC this fact\".",
      "But what did it tell the BBC about the child?",
      "Crucially, the BBC failed to uncover the information itself.",
      "Embarking on a documentary about one of the most polarising and contested issues of our age was always going to be challenging.",
      "The talented director at Hoyo, Jamie Roberts, has won an Emmy award for his film about the evacuation of Kabul. He's award-nominated for a powerful documentary about the events of 6 January in the US. He also made a searing film for the BBC about the Ukraine war.",
      "But he hadn't directed a documentary set in the Middle East before. He was working with the Palestinian journalist, Yousef Hammash, whose Gaza reporting for Channel 4 has won him a Bafta and an Emmy last year.",
      "The BBC commissioners in current affairs will have known the programme wasn't without risk.",
      "In circumstances like this, it's even more difficult to understand how the failings that have driven headlines for days - and done terrible damage to the BBC's reputation - could have occurred.",
      "Programme-makers and commissioners have previously told me they draw up risk grids to ensure they have the answers to any criticism thrown at them about their documentaries. They check and check and check to ensure they won't face problems after their programmes go out - or if they do, that they have the counter-argument ready.",
      "Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4's head of news and current affairs until 2020, told BBC Radio 4's Media Show she would have done her own checks rather than relying on the independent company.",
      "\"If I was making this film, I wouldn't just ask who the boy was, who his father was, who his mother was, I would ask for the entire family tree. They could easily have found out about him, it shows that due diligence was not done.",
      "\"I didn't wait for people to inform me of things,\" she added. \"I asked them the right questions.\"",
      "Byrne says in her view the film isn't \"pro-Hamas\".",
      "Watching it, I was struck by the efforts at balance. It contains voices who curse the leaders of Gaza.",
      "BBC impartiality",
      "One of the children followed by the documentary, 11-year old Zakaria, says he doesn't like Hamas \"because they started the war, they caused all this misery, this is wrong\". A woman says \"they are causing us harm\". There's a conversation about why taking Israeli civilians hostage is wrong.",
      "But we also see the horrors and violence of what's taken place in Gaza -  through the eyes of children. Zakaria, who hangs around the hospital to help the paramedics rather than remaining with his family because, he says, there's no food and water where they are, tells the camera he thinks he's seen 5,000 dead bodies.",
      "Renat who's 10 and is building up a social media presence with an online cookery show, describes drones that shoot bullets. She smiles and laughs wildly on camera, as she describes, still clearly traumatised, how a bomb just exploded right next to her as she was walking outside her apartment.",
      "As the press release put it, the documentary is an \"unflinching and vivid view of life in a warzone\". It's the kind of programme Turness said, as the BBC apologised, that her department \"should be doing\".",
      "But she added \"Of course we have to get it right.\"",
      "The BBC brand is based on impartiality - on being trusted around the world. All of us in news and current affairs take fact-checking very seriously. Mistakes are sometimes made, of course. But on this occasion both the independent production company and the BBC made serious errors which threaten trust in the corporation.",
      "Since joining the BBC as head of news in 2022, Turness has prioritised transparency to grow trust. Not informing viewers about the child narrator's family story is the opposite of transparent.",
      "She will have trusted the experienced BBC commissioners who oversaw the programme to do the appropriate due diligence. They will have trusted the filmmakers and the executive working with them.",
      "This isn't the end of the story and questions still remain. What exactly did the BBC ask about the boy and his family's potential connections to Hamas? Hoyo Films has said it's \"co-operating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston to help understand where mistakes have been made\".",
      "There's also the question about exactly how much was the \"limited sum\" paid for the young narrator's work - and whether that money ended up in the hands of Hamas. Yesterday in Parliament, Lisa Nandy said she had sought assurances from the BBC that it hadn't.",
      "The scandal comes in a week in which the BBC already was apologising over its failure to tackle behaviour by the DJ Tim Westwood - after a separate review that cost more than \u00a33m.",
      "Formal complaint",
      "What's happened has damaged trust in the BBC in so many ways. Those who argue the corporation is biased against Israel will feel vindicated.",
      "Leo Pearlman, co-CEO of the major British production company Fulwell 73, told us on Radio 4 that the BBC has \"gaslit the Jewish community\" in the 16 months since October 7th and that this documentary parroted 'the propaganda of Hamas\".",
      "For others who view the BBC as having anti-Palestinian bias, the decision to pull the documentary and apologise will confirm their beliefs. Artists For Palestine, which includes Gary Lineker, Anita Rani, Riz Ahmed and Miriam Margolyes, says the claims about the identity of the child's father are \"misleading\" and that to conflate his \"civil service role\" with terrorism is \"factually incorrect\".",
      "The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians has lodged a formal complaint against the BBC for taking down the documentary and \"suppressing the testimony of Palestinians\". It says the deputy minister for agriculture's role involves \"food production relating to crops, fishing and livestock\".",
      "What's unfolded since the programme's broadcast is unlikely to change minds on any side.",
      "The losers in all this are the young citizens of Gaza. The stories of the children in this film - and the suffering they have endured - aren't now being seen.",
      "Hoyo Films said it believes \"this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors \u2013 who have no say in the war \u2013 should have their voices heard\".",
      "The BBC has made clear it has no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer.",

      "GB News has won its judicial review of decisions made by TV watchdog Ofcom, that two shows hosted by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg breached the broadcasting code.",
      "The High Court judgment by Mrs Justice Collins Rice concluded that Ofcom's rulings were unlawful. It is the first time the watchdog has lost such a case.",
      "The judgement said Ofcom's initial rulings -  that the 9 May and 13 June 2023 broadcasts were in breach of its codes on \"due impartiality and due accuracy in news\" - were unlawful.",
      "GB News CEO Angelos Frangopoulos said the decision \"vindicates GB News' position as the fearless defender of free speech in the United Kingdom\", while Ofcom said it \"accepted the court's guidance\".",
      "'Fundamental failure'",
      "Mr Frangopoulos added: \"I call on the government and Parliament to consider the seriousness of this fundamental failure by Ofcom.\"",
      "The judge's ruling stated: \"I am minded to quash the two decisions in this case, and remit them to be reconsidered by Ofcom, subject to whatever further procedure may be fairly indicated.\"",
      "The court found that Ofcom had misapplied Rule 5.3 of the code, saying the provision only applies to \"news programmes\" and not to current affairs shows, such as the one Sir Jacob hosts.",
      "The decisions had been made as part of five GB News rulings by Ofcom in March last year, including three about shows hosted by Esther McVey and Philip Davies.",
      "Ofcom's rulings had said the State of the Nation shows hosted by Sir Jacob broke rules stating politicians should not usually front news coverage.",
      "The Ofcom code says a politician can't be a newsreader, interviewer or reporter in a news programme \"unless, exceptionally, it is editorially justified\". They can, however, front current affairs shows.",

      "Ofcom paying legal costs",
      "During the programmes, the \"host politicians acted as newsreaders, news interviewers or news reporters in sequences which clearly constituted news - including reporting breaking news events - without exceptional justification\", according to Ofcom investigations last year.",
      "The regulator concluded at the time: \"News was, therefore, not presented with due impartiality.\"",
      "But GB News responded to the rulings, saying: \"These decisions go against established precedent and raises serious questions about Ofcom's oversight over its own regulations.\"",
      "Ofcom said on Friday:  \"We accept the court's guidance on this important aspect of due impartiality in broadcast news and the clarity set out in its judgment.",
      "\"We will now review and consult on proposed changes to the broadcasting code to restrict politicians from presenting news in any type of programme to ensure this is clear for all broadcasters.\"",

    "story": [
      "The long-awaited first trailer for the new Shrek 5 film has been criticised by some film fans over the way characters have been animated, giving them different facial features.",
      "In the 27-second clip, recurring characters Shrek, Donkey, Pinocchio and Princess Fiona appear alongside Felicia - one of Shrek and Fiona's now grown-up children.",
      "The short teaser announces that Zendaya is joining the cast as Felicia, whilst also reintroducing Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy who are all reprising their roles.",
      "Oli Hyatt, who runs Blue Zoo Animation, told the BBC there's often \"an instant reaction\" when changes are made to a film like Shrek, due to its \"nostalgic properties\".",
      "Some users on social media have described the changes as \"disrespectful to the original art style\" and \"an AI interpretation of what Shrek 5 could look like\".",
      "Others have compared it to the film animation of video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, which Paramount Pictures changed after fan backlash in 2019.",
      "Hyatt added: \"The generation of children that watched Shrek back [when it was first released in 2001] are now adults.",
      "\"There's usually a feeling of 'this isn't what I knew' or 'I want the old show I remember back'\", he says.",
      "Hyatt, whose team contributed to The Adventures of Paddington and Lego City - No Limits, said that \"because the trailer is so short it's hard to tell how its going to look in general\".",
      "But, he added: \"You can see from a technical perspective, the advancement in technology.",
      "\"That means that on a similar or lower budget, you can producer a higher sheen and render quality, so it doesn't look quite as CGI (computer-generated imagery) and feels more tangible and real\".",
      "He doesn't feel like much has changed from the original \"art style\" of Shrek, but says \"the colours, vibrancy and realism\" have changed, which is a symptom of animation technology improving.",
      "In the short trailer, Shrek (Mike Myers), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Felicia (Zendaya) gather round a magic mirror to ask \"Who's the fairest of them all?\".",
      "The face in the mirror, which also appears to have had a bit of a makeover, responds that it is Shrek, with images then flashed up on screen of Shrek wearing glasses and posing, then dancing in a skintight catsuit before appearing with rippling abdominal muscles.",
      "This pays tribute to some of the internet's favourite Shrek memes, whilst giving viewers a first look at the now grown-up Felicia, who first came to life in Shrek The Third in 2007, alongside her triplet siblings Fergus and Farkle.",
      "Shrek's return was teased at the end of the Puss In Boots sequel in 2022, so fans have been expecting this new film for quite some time.",
      "Its perhaps why the much-loved film has sparked so much pushback, with fans joking that Shrek looks like he's has had \"botox and a face lift\" whilst others have criticised the characters for having rounder faces.",
      "But not everyone has a problem with the new looks - some have praised the animators for ageing the characters with greying hair and wrinkles, whilst others say the updated animations are just a symptom of CGI improving.",
      "'Forgotten in two minutes'",
      "Hyatt said that despite the criticism that's been levelled at the trailer, he believes it will be \"forgotten within two minutes of watching the movie\".",
      "\"Shrek has never been about looking cute or beautiful, it's about being gross with all the jokes and silliness,\" he says.",
      "\"If they [the producers] have got the script right and the characters right, then people will still love it, it's still a great franchise.\"",

    "story": [
      "The BBC has apologised and admitted \"serious flaws\" in the making of a documentary about children's lives in Gaza.",
      "The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from iPlayer last week after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "It said it has \"no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer\".",
      "Hoyo Films, the production company that made the documentary for the BBC, said it felt it was \"important to hear from voices that haven't been represented onscreen throughout the war with dignity and respect\".",
      "The company added it was \"cooperating fully\" with the BBC to \"help understand where mistakes have been made\".",
      "The BBC removed the documentary after concerns were raised that it centred on a boy called Abdullah who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others.",
      "It also launched a review into the film, and the BBC's Board met earlier on Thursday to discuss it.",
      "In the statement, a BBC spokesperson said both the production company and the BBC had made \"unacceptable\" flaws and that it \"takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation\".",
      "It added the BBC had not been informed of the teenager's family connection in advance by the film's production company.",
      "The spokesperson says: \"During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas.",
      "\"Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy's father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government; they have also acknowledged that they never told the BBC this fact.",
      "\"It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.\"",
      "Hoyo Films have told the corporation that they paid the young boy's mother \"a limited sum of money\" for narrating the film via his sister's bank account, the BBC statement added.",
      "It said Hoyo assured the BBC that no payments were made to any members of Hamas or its affiliates \"either directly, in kind or as a gift\", and that it is seeking \"additional assurance\" around the programme's budget.",
      "In its statement, Hoyo added: \"We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors \u2013 who have no say in the war \u2013 should have their voices heard\".",
      "'No stone unturned'",
      "A full audit of the expenditure on the film will be undertaken by the BBC, and it will be asking for the relevant financial accounts of Hoyo Films so this can be carried out.",
      "The BBC spokesperson said the incident had \"damaged\" the trust in the Corporation's journalism - and \"the processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations\".",
      "They added the director-general of the BBC had asked for complaints to be expedited to the Executive Complaints Unit, \"which is separate from BBC News\".",
      "A separate statement from the BBC Board added: \"The subject matter of the documentary was clearly a legitimate area to explore, but nothing is more important than trust and transparency in our journalism. While the board appreciates that mistakes can be made, the mistakes here are significant and damaging to the BBC.\"",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about the film during a press conference with US President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he had been \"concerned\" about it, adding that \"the secretary of state has had a meeting with the BBC\".",
      "On Friday, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she was going to have an \"urgent meeting\" with the BBC chair Samir Shah later that day.",
      "She said the BBC had \"acknowledged serious failings\" by them and the production company Hoyo Films.",
      "\"I want assurances that no stone will be left unturned by the fact-finding review now commissioned by the BBC's director general,\" she said.",
      "\"This review must be comprehensive, rigorous and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened in this case. It is critical for trust in the BBC that this review happens quickly, and that appropriate action is taken on its findings.\"",
      "Earlier this week, the BBC was criticised for pulling the programme by more than 500 media figures, including Gary Lineker, Anita Rani and Riz Ahmed.",

      "In the series, Hardwicke's character Rob suffers from depression and takes his own life, causing Connell's mental health to suffer.",
      "But Hardwicke said that it's not the fact he wouldn't be in any sequel, that makes him not want one.",
      "\"I'd be very happy to watch it as a punter, because then I could enjoy it,\" he said, speaking at the annual Oscar Wilde event to celebrate Irish talent.",
      "He also admitted that he can see why some people want to revisit the series.",
      "\"Of course, part of me is curious, I'd love to see those characters in 15 years,\" he said.",
      "\"I just adore Sally [Rooney]'s writing so much, I'm excited every time she releases a new book, so I'm just looking forward to reading what she does next.\"",
      "Hardwicke said he still speaks to his Normal People co-stars.",
      "\"We all stay in touch, which is nice. It was a really special thing for all of us,\" he said.",
      "\"I think that will never change. It will always be a really foundational job for all of us, so we do stay in touch.",
      "\"Every now and then we meet for a pint and go, 'God, wasn't that mad'.\"",
      "More recently, Hardwicke starred as murderer Benjamin Field in BBC One true crime drama The Sixth Commandment.",
      "The series follows the death of Peter Farquhar in Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire in 2015, and Field's later seduction of Farquhar's elderly neighbour, Ann Moore-Martin, who died in 2017.",
      "Hardwicke said he didn't have an answer for why people are so fascinated by true crime, but said as an actor, \"you just want to work on stuff that has that depth\".",
      "\"There's a responsibility to telling true stories, to know why you're doing it, why you're telling the story, what's the point,\" he said.",
      "\"It was approaching true stories in a different way. I felt, when I read that script, it was doing it with scrutiny and care and it didn't feel at all manipulative.\"",

    "story": [
      "A man accused of stealing a \u00a34.8m golden toilet used it on a visit to Blenheim Palace the day before the heist, describing it as \"splendid\", a court has heard.",
      "The artwork, called America, was taken from the stately home in Oxfordshire in the early hours of 14 September 2019, two days after it went on display.",
      "Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, denies one count of burglary. Frederick Doe, 36, from Windsor and 41-year-old Bora Guccuk, from west London, both deny conspiring to transfer criminal property.",

      "The 18-carat gold, fully-functional toilet was part of an exhibition by the Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan.",
      "The court previously heard Mr Jones had visited the palace twice before the theft.",
      "Prosecution barrister Julian Christopher KC  asked Mr Jones why he had taken a half-day off work on the Friday to visit the palace, rather than waiting until the weekend.",
      "Mr Jones admitted he did not often book half-days off work to go to museums and exhibitions but it was because he \"was interested to go and see it\".",
      "Members of the public booked slots to use the toilet in its cubicle as part of the exhibition.",
      "Photos he had taken were again listed to the jury and Jones said he took many of them because they were \"interesting\" views or pieces of art.",
      "One was of the window later broken to steal the gold toilet, jurors were told.",
      "A lock on the cubicle to the toilet was also photographed.",
      "Jones said it was because he thought it was \"quite funny that you could actually lock yourself in the toilet\".",
      "Questioned if he \"took advantage of\" the gold toilet's \"facilities\", he told the court that he did make use of it.",

      "A fourth man, James Sheen, 40, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, has previously pleaded guilty to burglary.",
      "Jones told the court he was friends with Sheen and that he worked as a roofer and general builder for Sheen's building firm.",
      "During his evidence he said that messages and voice notes between the two of them around the time of the heist were work-related or about a large dog kennel he was planning to help Sheen collect from Milton Keynes immediately after his visit to the exhibition.",
      "He denied that his two visits to the palace in the days before the raid were as reconnaissance for the robbery.",
      "He told the jury he went to the palace on 7 September to see a car show and again on the 13 September to see the exhibition.",
      "The toilet weighed 98kg and was insured for $6m (\u00a34.8m). Gold prices at the time would have seen the gold alone worth \u00a32.8m, the court heard.",

    "story": [
      "When Japanese journalist Shiori Ito decided to speak up about her rape allegations, she knew she would do so in the face of a society that prefers silence.",
      "\"I'm scared\u2026but all I want to do is to talk about the truth,\" she says, in the opening scene of her Oscar-nominated documentary Black Box Diaries.",
      "Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, of rape. He denies the charges.",
      "Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice, after authorities found insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.",
      "But there is one country where the documentary has still not been aired: Japan - where it has run into huge controversy.",
      "Shiori's former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage that she did not have permission to use, which, they maintain, has violated trust and put her sources at risk.",
      "She defends what she did as necessary for \"public good\".",
      "It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke. Then 28 years old, Shiori had chosen to ignore her family's request to remain silent about the alleged rape. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Yamaguchi - and won $30,000 (\u00a322,917) in damages.",
      "Shiori told the BBC making the film involved \"re-living her trauma\".",
      "\"It took me four years [to make the film] because, emotionally, I was struggling.\"",

      "Shiori claims she was raped following a dinner in Tokyo with Mr Yamaguchi, who has always denied the allegations.",
      "CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel forms part of the more than 400 hours of footage which she has edited for the documentary.",
      "Shiori, who directed and wrote Black Box Diaries, describes the editing process as \"really challenging\".",
      "\"It was like hardcore exposure therapy,\" she says.",
      "But when the film was released, the CCTV footage included in the documentary became a source of friction between the director and the team of lawyers who had helped her win her civil case.",
      "The lawyers stated her use of CCTV footage was unauthorised - and that Shiori had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .",
      "Last week, her former lawyers - led by Yoko Nishihiro - held a press conference, in which she said Shiori's use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.",
      "\"If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,\" Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "Ms Nishihiro claimed Shiori also used unauthorised recordings in the film, which the lawyer only discovered following the screening of the film last July.",
      "The documentary included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower in relation to the investigation process, as well as video of a taxi driver who had provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape.",
      "Both the detective and the taxi driver, the lawyers have argued, were identifiable in the film - and neither had given their consent to be featured.",
      "\"I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,\"  Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "\"I want her to explain and be held accountable.\"",
      "Shiori has previously acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV footage, but has argued that it provided \"the only visual evidence\" of the night she claims she was sexually assaulted.",
      "She said including audio of the police detective was necessary because of \"the cover-up of the investigation\", and has insisted she was releasing the video \"for the public good\".",
      "\"We are standing in different points of view,\" she said, referring to her fall-out with her former lawyers.",
      "\"For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.\"",
      "There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. According to Shiori, \"Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]\".",
      "However, it remains unclear how far the lack of distribution might also be due to legal hurdles.",
      "In her most recent statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals could not be identified. She said a redacted version would be screened at a later stage.",
      "\"There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of - but I wanted to put all of it, and to show we are also human,\" she told the BBC.",

      "Why is Japan redefining rape?",
      "In the nine years since the assault, Shiori's fight against Japan's justice system has been well-chronicled in the media - and is something she says she wanted to detail in her documentary.",
      "She was met with a wave of backlash when she went public in 2017, receiving hate mail and online abuse.",
      "\"People were telling me you're not crying enough\u2026 you're not wearing proper clothes... you're too strong.\"",
      "Some criticised the way she was dressed at the press conference where she first accused Yamaguchi  \u2013 they said her shirt had been buttoned too low down. Shiori said she left Japan for a few months, fearing for her safety.",
      "Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from \"forcible sexual intercourse\" to \"non-consensual sexual intercourse\" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.",
      "Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: \"Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.\"",
      "For now it's unclear if her  film will ever be screened in Japan, but she says that its homecoming would be her ultimate prize.",

    "story": [
      "On the other side of west Belfast's peace wall, Young Spencer is rapping about subjects similar to Kneecap.",
      "Like them, he references drugs, paramilitaries and identity.",
      "But - it's told from a totally different perspective to the famous (and infamous) Irish language hip-hop trio.",
      "While Kneecap wrap themselves in the Irish tricolour, in one of his songs Young Spencer continually talks about the red, white and blue of the Union flag.",
      "Yet recently they shared a stage in the city and thousands of Kneecap's fans sang along with a man who describes himself as proud to be British.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, the rapper said his appearance in front of the sold-out SSE Arena crowd was about bringing communities together based on more than just their religion.",
      "\"At the end of the day, to me that was more so about the unification of the city,\" he said.",
      "\"Yes, you're from the Falls and I'm from the Shankill, but it's more so about this city that we come from.\"",
      "He said when the west Belfast rap trio first reached out about performing at their show in December there were nerves.",
      "\"There's just as much reason to say no as to say yes, and people would go 'why is that? It's the biggest opportunity of your life',\" he added.",
      "\"You are still driven with fear as much as you are driven with love, and you're still worried that people aren't receptive to where you're from and when you're talking about greatness and moving the city forward and the country forward as a whole.",
      "\"Maybe some people won't understand Kneecap and Young Spencer on the same stage until 20, 30 years' time, but that's ok because what's supposed to be understood will be understood.\"",
      "From the Shankill to the SSE",
      "Young Spencer is the alter-ego of Gareth Spence, who during the day works in a school in Belfast.",
      "He was raised on the Shankill Road, which he admits saw guns, drugs, paramilitaries and division during many troubled years in Northern Ireland.",
      "But living there has been in his own words \"a gift\" as well as a curse.",
      "Now 30 years old, he got into rapping as a teenager after getting therapy, and said personal traumas have influenced his music.",
      "\"We're all reporters... we have a responsibility to speak on these issues and be a voice for the voiceless and we will always be a voice for the city.",
      "\"Real change happens and I feel like that's what the show represented more than anything.\"",
      "Gareth said we can't be shy of acknowledging that there is always likely to be division.",
      "Yet he believes more is shared across Belfast's working-class areas.",
      "\"A lot of people have this sort of warped opinion of the communities that we're from too, whether it be the Shankill or the Falls, anywhere in Belfast because they go back to this troublesome period from 30 years ago and they still stay stuck in that.",
      "\"But you'll find unification in so many ways and so many different forms now in the city than you ever have.\"",
      "United more than divided",
      "The rapper said we're \"a lot closer to peace now than we've ever been\".",
      "\"There will always be division of some extent, we will never get away from that completely because that's life and not everybody likes each other and that's just plain and simple,\" he told Good Morning Ulster.",
      "\"But everybody has the right to be identified as who they identify as.",
      "\"My thing is that being a proud Protestant, being from Belfast, being from the Shankill, doesn't take away from them being proud Catholics and being from west Belfast and being from the Falls Road, why can't we unite?\"",
      "Across Young Spencer's social media platforms is the acronym P.R.O.D - but it is used more so as a set of principles to live by rather than a label.",
      "\"Passion, persistence, respect, resilience, opportunity to overcome, dedication, determination,\" he explained.",
      "\"You can look into the colours and identify my background, pick here and there and do whatever you want, but that's the core set of values and principles that got me to where I am here today and help me keep living my dream.\"",
      "So what's next for the Shankill's son?",
      "\"Inspire to inspire, motivate to motivate. Persisting with my passion when they chose to hate,\" he said.",
      "\"Respect is earned, resilience is where I was raised, opportunity comes, overcome and make your name. Determined and dedicated to making a change and that's P.R.O.D.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not.",
      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "- - - - -",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for acting, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",
      "\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "12. Clarence Maclin knows what time it is",
      "Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.",
      "But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.",
      "Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.",
      "In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.",

    "summary": "The Monster Hunter series exploded in popularity globally after years of success in Japan. How did they do it?",
    "story": [
      "The latest release in one of Japan's most popular video game series has had one of the most successful debuts of all time.",
      "More than one million players have logged on to the PC version of Monster Hunter Wilds within hours of its launch, according to figures from online store Steam.",
      "There have been complaints from the first wave of players on Steam about the game's performance on computers, but its critical response has been positive.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to director Yuya Tokuda and producer Ryozo Tsujimoto prior to the release of Wilds about turning the game into a global hit.",
      "Monster Hunter first launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004.",
      "As the title suggests, players spend the game navigating an area known as The Forbidden Lands capturing and battling a cast of increasingly fearsome beasts.",
      "Long-time fans of the series are drawn in by its challenging, complex systems and option to play co-operatively, teaming up with friends to take down massive foes.",
      "Breakout 2018 hit Monster Hunter World has has sold 21.3 million copies, according to publisher Capcom, rising to 28.1 million when sales of an upgraded 2019 edition are included.",
      "Producer Mr Tsujimoto told BBC Newsbeat the game was a culmination of all the work and lessons learned from previous titles on the series.",
      "\"Anything that we hadn't been doing we really tried to do with Monster Hunter World to get everything ready so that the game was ready to break through,\" he said.",
      "Games industry layoffs and studio closures in the West and Europe have led to fears of \"brain drain\" - a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.",
      "Japan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.",
      "Monster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.",
      "\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.",
      "\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"",
      "Other Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.",
      "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020.",
      "The company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time.",
      "This can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.",
      "'We're working in our own lanes'",
      "The Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way.",
      "More recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.",
      "At last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".",
      "That includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.",
      "\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.",

      "Developer of indie video game hit Balatro wins battle over age rating",
      "Japan does face some of the same challenges as other developers worldwide.",
      "Player habits are changing, with PC gaming increasing in popularity, and as technology becomes more advanced making games becomes more expensive.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\".",
      "\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"",
      "The games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.",
      "It leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.",
      "\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.",
      "\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"",
      "For an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.",
      "\"You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,\" he says.",
      "\"But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through.\"",

      "The Last Showgirl has received a mixed reception from critics, though most have praised Anderson's performance.",

      "In 1979, about 10,000 people worked at Corby's steelworks, but, with Britain experiencing a decline in heavy industry, steel production became uncompetitive, leading to the site's closure in 1980.",

      "A 1999 Northamptonshire Health Authority study found no unusual cluster of birth defects.",
      "However, solicitor Des Collins, after reading about the cases, conducted his own investigation, revealing birth defects in Corby were three times higher than in the surrounding area.",
      "Mr Collins assembled a team of experts, including toxicologists and pollution specialists, to argue that the council's mismanagement of toxic waste had spread contaminated dust throughout the town.",
      "The heavy metal cadmium was identified on the former steel site, and a medical expert cited research linking it to birth defects in animals.",

    "summary": "Amanda Pritchard's exit comes as the government moves to assert more direct over healthcare.",
    "story": [
      "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, would have regular Monday meetings with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to review performance and address challenges. But last Monday was different. After discussing the state of the health service, she announced she was stepping down - with just one month's notice.",
      "It came as a shock to many in the organisation, under which there are 1.4 million staff who deal with 1.7 million patients everyday. But those in the know had suspected something was happening - though not the timing.",
      "That meeting between Pritchard and Streeting was the natural conclusion of changes which had been rumbling on in the corridors of power for some time.",
      "NHS England was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2013. The aim was to free the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Under Sir Simon Stevens - now Lord Stevens - NHS England developed into what looked like a rival power base and led by an alternative health secretary. He was at the heart of work drawing up long-term NHS plans under David Cameron and Theresa May. Lord Stevens knew his way around Whitehall and knew how to win backroom battles with ministers.",
      "Amanda Pritchard had been deputy to Lord Stevens since 2019 and played a vital role in the NHS response to the pandemic, including the vaccine roll-out. It had seemed inevitable she would take over the top job in 2021. Understandably, she expected to continue in the same vein as her predecessor. But with the arrival of a Labour government last year that certainty began to weaken.",
      "The first clue that things would be going back to a more traditional management regime, with more direct government control, came when two health experts were appointed from previous Labour governments: Alan Milburn, Blair's health secretary, and Paul Corrigan, an adviser. It became clear that they would be involved in shaping policy with Wes Streeting.",
      "One well-placed health source said those two \"remembered the old days\", before the NHS's shift to autonomy, which they felt made the system \"too bureaucratic\".",
      "Another clue came when work began on a new NHS 10-year plan for England. With previous plans Lord Stevens had \"held the pen\", but this time the government brought in Sally Warren from the King's Fund think tank - outside NHS England management - to head up the work.",
      "At the same time, noises were being made about slimming down NHS England management - and instead devolving money to local health boards and patient services. Government sources deny that NHS England is being subsumed into the health department but say it will have a \"leaner\" role, cutting out duplication.",
      "Amanda Pritchard was well aware of the direction of travel. She could see that her job was going to change and had considered stepping down later this year. There has been no suggestion of any row or confrontation with Wes Streeting.",
      "NHS officials say that the decision to leave at the end of March was because it will be the end of a financial year - and there was no need to stay for the launch of the 10-year plan in the early summer.",
      "In January Ms Pritchard had a bruising experience at the hands of two parliamentary select committees. One suggested she and colleagues were \"complacent\" and another said they were disappointed with \"lengthy and diffuse answers\". In a BBC interview she admitted that \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings\" but it was right to be scrutinised. Privately, according to sources, she found the process \"frustrating given how much time she had given to the role\" under some of the most difficult years in the history of the NHS.",
      "She will be replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, an experienced NHS trust boss, who is being titled the \"transition\" chief executive. Policy will be run by Wes Streeting's department with Sir Jim, we are told, focusing on delivery including cutting the hospital waiting list of nearly 7.5 million. He had recently helped draft a recovery plan for planned treatment and appointments.",

      "So where does all this leave the NHS?",
      "On one hand, Amanda Pritchard has provided consistent leadership in various roles under six different health secretaries. The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.",
      "But on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.",
      "One health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover. But another suggested it was \"a bit of a mess\" and there could now be instability and distractions for NHS administrators when they need to focus on wider health challenges.",
      "Much will depend on how much money is allocated in the Treasury spending review.",
      "It's patients that matter - and it's not yet clear whether or not these changes will help them."

      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",

      "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",
      "\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"",
      "He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",
      "\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.",
      "In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.",
      "And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.",
      "An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.",
      "The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.",
      "And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",
      "Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.",

      "Ketamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'",
      "But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.",
      "'It's in the schools, it's in the parks'",
      "One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",
      "The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.",
      "Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"",
      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

      "Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending.",
      "In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her \"hard work, deep commitment and friendship\".",
      "He said cutting aid was a \"difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\" adding: \"We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development.\"",

      "She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance].",
      "However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to \"absorb the entire burden\".",
      "She said the cuts would \"likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\".",
      "\"It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations.\"",
      "The spending cuts mean \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income.",
      "The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support.",
      "He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move.",
      "Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister.",
      "But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \"only make the world less safe\".",
      "Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \"shameful\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds.",

      "However one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \"disgraceful and cynical actions\". \"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Two independent MPs are calling for changes to the way seats on parliamentary committees are allocated, saying the current system is \"undemocratic\".",
      "Shockat Adam and Iqbal Mohamed, who were elected in 2024 as independent MPs, want to sit on select committees, which can question ministers; or bill committees, which scrutinise legislation in detail.",
      "Speaking to BBC News, Mohamed said the call was about having equal opportunity to contribute and being a \"good parliamentarian\".",
      "Their comments followed a Procedure Committee hearing earlier this week where MPs heard about their experiences as independent members.",
      "During the hearing both Adam and Mohamed said the lack of committee membership opportunities impacted their ability to fully represent constituents.",
      "Adam, who represents Leicester South, said it felt as though independent MPs were \"not able to contribute\" with their expertise to committees.",
      "\"We're still as elected as any other individual from any political party, we hold the same mandate.",
      "\"That is one area that we miss out and I feel that my constituents miss out on,\" he said.",
      "Corbyn forms new group with four pro-Gaza MPs",
      "Speaking to BBC News following the hearing, Mohamed, who represents Dewsbury and Batley in West Yorkshire, said his desire to sit on a select committee was about equal opportunity.",
      "\"It's being a good citizen, a good parliamentarian and having that opportunity to contribute in the same way as other MPs.",
      "\"It does come across as slightly undemocratic, but the aim isn't to be the same or replace or kick out other people; it's just having that same opportunity to contribute to the governance of our country,\" he said.",
      "Under current parliamentary rules independent MPs are not automatically entitled to membership on select or bill committees.",
      "For select committees, political parties control the process and allocate seats in proportion to the size of each party's parliamentary intake.",
      "This means that the Labour Party gets the largest share of select committee seats, then the Conservatives, followed by the Liberal Democrats and so on.",
      "However, parties are able to voluntarily give up a seat for an independent MP or an MP from a different party, such as when the Green party's Caroline Lucas was given a spot on the Environmental Audit Committee from 2015 to 2024.",
      "All MPs can ask questions in the Commons chamber and participate in debates there and in Westminster Hall, as well as submitting written questions to ministers.",
      "Mohamed said his background in science and engineering was one thing he could bring to a select or bill committee.",
      "He also mentioned the \"wide breadth of experience\" independent MPs have across their alliance, as well as their interest in foreign affairs - several won their seats on pro-Gaza platforms.",
      "\"We're at a point in history where the public have lost faith in politics and politicians - and I'm including myself in that group because I'm part of that elected group now. And anything we can do to rebuild that trust and to demonstrate fairness, impartiality, transparency, balance...I think it's only a good thing,\" he said.",
      "Five of the independents - including Adam, Mohamed and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - wrote to the Speaker in September announcing they were forming an \"independent alliance\" in Parliament.",
      "This is known as a technical grouping, differing from a political party as members are bound by shared interests and ideology rather than under an official organisation.",
      "This prompted the Procedure Committee to begin holding inquiries into the status of parliamentary groupings and independent MPs as a whole.",
      "A spokesperson for the Procedure Committee said: \"The Procedure Committee has undertaken an inquiry into the status of independent MPs in House procedures.",
      "\"The inquiry is still ongoing and the committee will report back with its proposals in due course.\""

      "The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments.",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices.",

      "GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under.",
      "Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments.",
      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",
      "More money to cover rising costs",
      "The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.",
      "The total figure includes almost \u00a3800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients.",
      "Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff.",
      "GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations.",
      "Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\".",
      "\"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.",
      "\"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment.",
      "\"This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs' time and backing them with an extra \u00a3889m next year.",
      "\"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\"",
      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",
      "\"There is little in this contract that is going to help patients access care quicker than they do already because it hasn't managed to address the underlying issue of national insurance contributions and the vast sums of money that will need to go towards that,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, Azeem Majeed, London GP and professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said overall, the contract was a positive development.",
      "\"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.",
      "\"The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,\" he said.",
      "\"But it will take some time for people to see improvements from this investment.\""

    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

    "story": [
      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.",
      "Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.",
      "1. A surprise letter to Trump from King Charles",
      "Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.",
      "Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.",
      "Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"",
      "After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting",
      "Trump's letter from the King: What does it say and what does it mean?",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.",
      "Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".",
      "2. Trump wanted to take charge",
      "While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.",
      "The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.",
      "A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.",
      "Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.",
      "At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.",
      "Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.",
      "3. The similarities between Starmer and Trump",
      "To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.",
      "But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"",
      "What else do they share? Trump said: \"We like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country.\"",
      "But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.",
      "4. Starmer a 'tough negotiator'",
      "Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference the president called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".",
      "Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".",
      "Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".",
      "5. Trump 'minded' to accept UK's Chagos deal",
      "Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.",
      "The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.",
      "The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.",
      "But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".",
      "6. 'Did I say that?' Trump walks back comments on Zelensky",
      "Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.",
      "An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"",
      "In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".",
      "Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.",
      "7. Starmer hits back at free speech criticism",
      "At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"",
      "Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".",
      "That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

    "story": [
      "Andrew and Tristan Tate, the controversial British-American social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, have been freed from travel restrictions in Romania after several high-level White House officials took an interest in their case.",
      "It's unclear what, if any, role Donald Trump's administration may have played in their release, but one of Trump's top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month.",
      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",
      "On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.",
      "Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.",
      "What is the White House saying?",
      "When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"",
      "But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania.",
      "Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers' case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times.",
      "And Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich.",
      "Hurezeanu said the Tates were mentioned during that conversation, but denied being pressured to release the pair.",

      "One of Tate's lawyers now works as White House liaison to the US justice department.",
      "Paul Ingrassia was part of a team representing the Tate brothers in a defamation lawsuit they filed in Florida against several of their alleged victims.",
      "Ingrassia also acted as Tate's publicist and says he got the influencer onto a show hosted by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host.",
      "He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".",
      "Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.",
      "Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"",
      "The statement alleged that the Tates and others are victims of \"weaponised legal systems\" and \"politically motivated prosecutions\".",
      "McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.",
      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",
      "Like many other extreme influencers, in the face of criticism he often claims his posts are satire or jokes, mocking his detractors as his messages spread further, propelled by online outrage.",
      "'He's just a bro': Trump's attempts to woo the 'manosphere'",
      "'He's just a bro': Trump's attempts to woo the 'manosphere'",
      "Trump supporters split",
      "The pair's supporters were thrilled with his release and eager to proclaim their innocence, despite the outstanding charges against them.",
      "Four British women who have filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate meanwhile issued a statement calling on UK authorities to \"take action\", saying they were \"in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news\".",
      "And support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers.",
      "Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where Tates landed on Thursday, said of their activities: \"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct.\"",
      "The state's attorney general later said he would open a preliminary inquiry into the Tates and said Florida has \"zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women\".",
      "In the conservative Washington Examiner, podcaster Brady Leonard wrote: \"Tate's obnoxious, misogynistic brand is toxic to everyone besides electorally insignificant corners of social media.\"",
      "Matt Lewis, a US conservative political commentator who has been critical of Trump in the past, said advocating on behalf of Tate \"fits in with the ethos of the Maga world right now, which is: 'let's be tough guys'\".",
      "\"But I also think it speaks to a legitimate problem, which we have seen in the last couple decades, a problem with men...where there's an epidemic of loneliness, a sense the world is passing them by, a sense that modernity has made it harder to be successful as a husband and a father. I think that's had some real psychic effects,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",
      "Prison gangs: \u2018I've chopped people,  attacked staff, hidden drugs\u2019",
      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",
      "But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.",
      "Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.",
      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",
      "The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.",

      "Take a look at the Labour Party's election manifesto, written less than a year ago, if you would like proof of that.",
      "On page 125, it says: \"Labour is committed to restoring development spending at the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as soon as fiscal circumstances allow.\"",
      "The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite \u2013 cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it.",
      "There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind \u2013 and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic.",
      "Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later.",
      "But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence.",
      "The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. \"It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy,\" as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance.",
      "Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two.",
      "Little wonder, then, that we have seen a blitz of the jitters in European capitals as presidents and prime ministers try to work out what it may or may not mean.",
      "The task facing Starmer - the second strand of the European tag team of leaders to visit Washington, after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday - is to attempt to mould President Donald Trump's position.",

    "story": [
      "The uncertain future of two killer whales is no closer to being resolved despite the closure of their marine zoo home two months ago.",
      "Wikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo are still being kept at Marineland Antibes, located in southern France, after it closed in January due to a forthcoming law banning the use of orcas in shows.",
      "For months managers at Marineland have tried to send the killer whales to other marine zoos but this has angered animal rights campaigners who want them housed in a sanctuary, where the orcas won't have to perform or be used for breeding.",
      "The orcas were expected to go to another marine zoo in Spain when the French government rejected a move to a proposed sanctuary in Canada a few weeks ago.",
      "But now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.",
      "'Humans are all they know' - Fate of whales uncertain as marine zoo shuts",
      "France bans captive breeding of dolphins",
      "The ecology ministry, when asked by the BBC, had no further information on where a sanctuary might be located or who would fund its construction and running costs.",
      "Loro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.",
      "Christoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.",
      "Most designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - are properly fed and looked after.",
      "Kiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".",
      "Campaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.",
      "Managers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.",
      "They also fear Wikie might be used for breeding. Loro Parque announced in January that Morgan, the only female of the three orcas currently kept there, is pregnant.",
      "Katheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.",
      "She added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"",
      "Marineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.",
      "'The water is too warm for orcas'",
      "The whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.",
      "They were told the site they had selected in Nova Scotia was too far away and that the water there was too cold for Wikie and Keijo, who have spent their whole lives in southern France.",
      "Following Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.",
      "They wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"",
      "He added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\"",
      "The directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.",
      "Other animal rights groups have been more welcoming of Pannier-Runacher's announcement, saying a European sanctuary would still be better for the orcas' welfare than life in another marine zoo.",
      "Sea Shepherd, a marine conservation society, replied to the minister on Instagram saying this was a chance to achieve what the zoo industry calls \"impossible\" - the building of an ocean sanctuary where captive orcas can enjoy the rest of their lives.",
      "Pannier-Runacher said in her video she was keenly aware of the strong feelings people had about where Wikie and Keijo should be rehomed.",
      "She did not rule out sending them to Loro Parque or other marine zoos, only that she would \"oppose any transfer to a site that is not suitable for accommodating\" orcas.",
      "Last November she blocked an application by Marineland to send the killer whales to a marine zoo in Japan, citing lower animal welfare regulations in the country.",
      "The 'Year of the Sea' is currently underway in France, a government initiative to raise awareness about the importance of the ocean, and Pannier-Runacher believes the creation of a European whale sanctuary would be a fitting testament to it.",
      "\"I'm not telling you that it will work,\" she told Instagram users. \"But nothing ventured, nothing gained.\"",

    "summary": "The decision follows years of trials but some farmers are concerned there could be negative impacts.",
    "story": [
      "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.",
      "The decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.",
      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

      "Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash.",
      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",
      "The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum.",

      "The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.",
      "Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.",
      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",
      "Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.",
      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",
      "The scientists believe the skull gave some protection to the brain.",

      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",

      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",

      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",

    "story": [
      "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.",
      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",
      "Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.",
      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",
      "\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.",
      "\"It will save the economy money by 2040, it saves people money on their energy bills, it saves people money on their driving costs, but all of that is underpinned by a cheaper electricity price.\"",

    "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

    "summary": "The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister.",
    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

      "It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free.",
      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",
      "In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.",
      "Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News.",

      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 13:29:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",
      "Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature",
      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",
      "However Mr Painter agreed \"100%\" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.",

      "The group owned several leading visual effects studios including MPC, Mikros Animation and The Mill, with operations in the US, UK, Canada and India.",
      "Technicolor's directors had been looking to sell the business, but were not able to find a buyer.",
      "Its administrators said \"the majority\" of the more than 440 people it employed in the UK have been made redundant. The appointment of administrators relates only to the UK arm of its business.",
      "\"The economic headwinds which are affecting companies right across the creative industries have proved too challenging to overcome, which has led to Technicolor's UK business being placed into administration today,\" the firm's joint administrator Nick Holloway said.",

      "As well as purely animated films and TV, many live action releases are in large part the work of the employees of VFX studios.",

      "She also said the US writers' strike which led to a slow-down in demand for VFX work causing \"severe\" pressure on cashflow.",
      "Those same issues will add to the anxiety of staff and may fear re-entering what has been a relatively lean jobs market for VFX professionals.",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "In the days since the news of Hackman's death, I've been speaking to people here in Los Angeles and beyond, who, like Sonnenfeld, knew and worked with him.",

He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",

      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Outlawed Kurdish group the PKK has declared a ceasefire with Turkey after its jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan called on the movement to lay down its arms and dissolve.",
      "In Saturday's statement, the PKK said it hoped Turkey would release Ocalan, who has been imprisoned in solitary confinement since 1999, so he could lead a process of disarmament.",
      "It follows his call this week aimed at ending four decades of armed struggle in south-eastern Turkey in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.",
      "His announcement came months after Devlet Bahceli, the leader of Turkey's ultra-nationalist MHP party and an ally of the Turkish government, launched an initiative to bring an end to the conflict.",
      "The PKK - which stands for the Kurdistan Workers' Party - has waged an insurgency since 1984, with the initial aim of carving out an independent homeland for Kurds, who account for about 20% of Turkey's 85 million people.",
      "The group has since moved away from its separatist goals, and is now pushing for more autonomy and greater Kurdish rights.",
      "It is banned as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.",
      "Who are the Kurds?",
      "Who are the Kurds?",
      "Ocalan - affectionately referred to as Apo by Kurdish nationalists - met MPs from a pro-Kurdish party this week on Imrali, an island in the Sea of Marmara, south-west of Istanbul, where he is imprisoned.",
      "\"In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today,\" the PKK executive committee said in a statement on Saturday, quoted by the pro-PKK ANF news agency.",
      "\"None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,\" it added.",
      "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said later on Saturday that military operations would resume against the PKK if \"promises given [by the group] are not kept\" and the disarmament process stalled.",
      "The PKK said Ocalan's prison conditions must be eased, adding he \"must be able to live and work in physical freedom and be able to establish unhindered relationships with anyone he wants, including his friends\".",
      "Calling for disarmament, Ocalan had appealed to members of the PKK in a letter read out by Dem party members Ahmet Turk and Pervin Buldan in both Kurdish and Turkish.",
      "He said \"all groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself\", adding that his movement was formed primarily because \"the channels of democratic politics were closed\".",
      "However, Bahceli, backed by positive signals from Erdogan and other political parties, had created the right environment for the PKK to lay down its arms, Ocalan added.",
      "Kurdish leaders largely welcomed the development. Local reports said thousands of people gathered to watch the statement on big screens in the cities of Diyarbakir and Van in the predominantly Kurdish south-east.",
      "However, significant questions remain among both the Kurdish and Turkish public over what the next steps might be - and not everyone was convinced things would change.",
      "Last week, senior PKK commander Duran Kalkan said Turkey's ruling party, the AKP, was not looking for a solution but to \"take over, destroy and annihilate\".",
      "Turkish-backed forces in north-eastern Syria have intensified their campaign against Kurdish forces and last month called on Syria's new leaders to eliminate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.",
      "Pro-Kurdish politicians have been targeted by a wave of arrests and jail sentences in recent years in Turkey.",
      "Some 40,000 people have died since the PKK's insurgency began.",
      "There was a spike in violence in south-eastern Turkey from 2015 to 2017 when a two-and-a-half year ceasefire broke down.",
      "More recently, in October the PKK claimed an attack on the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) headquarters near Ankara which left five people dead."

      "\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\" said Zelensky, who has been critical of direct talks between Washington and Moscow. \"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance responded, tearing into the stunned Ukrainian leader.",
      "\"Mr President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"",
      "He also accused Zelensky of having campaigned on behalf of Democrats during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a munitions factory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met Trump's rival, Kamala Harris, at the White House.",

      "The contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater.",
      "But Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly sceptical of US aid to Ukraine.",
      "When he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: \"I've got to be honest with you. I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.\"",
      "The vice-president derided Trump as an idiot eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement.",

      "One common thread is that many victims of Vance's tongue-lashing are America's allies.",
      "It began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there.",
      "But Vance used the occasion to launch a blistering assault on the state of European democracy, accusing continental leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.",
      "\"If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,\" he said.",
      "The audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was horrified.",
      "This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security.",
      "This was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent.",
      "Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party.",
      "His speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics.",
      "Yet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson.",
      "Vance accused him of \"moralistic garbage\", \"historical illiteracy\" and - worst of all - of being a \"globalist\".",
      "And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week.",
      "Out of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens\".",
      "The prime minister pushed back firmly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\u2026 We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "This was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms.",
      "The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.",
      "Several questions present themselves. Was Vance's attack on Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe?",
      "White House sources have told US papers it was not.",
      "Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to dish out punishment to the president's opponents?",
      "Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again?",
      "Whatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two."

    "story": [
      "A plane crash in South Korea last December left Park Guen-woo an orphan. The 22-year-old had barely found space to mourn his parents when he came across a torrent of online abuse, conspiracies and malicious jokes made about the victims.",
      "The Jeju Air plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, crash-landed at Muan International Airport on 29 December and exploded after slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, killing 179 of the 181 people on board.",
      "Police investigations have identified and apprehended eight people who have been accused of making derogatory and defamatory online posts. These included suggestions that families were \"thrilled\" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were \"fake victims\" - to the extent that some felt compelled to prove they had lost their loved ones.",
      "Authorities have taken down at least 427 such posts.",
      "But this is not the first time that bereaved families in South Korea have found themselves the targets of online abuse. Speaking to the BBC, experts described a culture where economic struggles, financial envy and social issues such as toxic competitiveness are fuelling hate speech.",
      "Financial resentment",
      "Following Seoul's Halloween crowd crush in 2022, victims and bereaved families were similarly smeared. A man who lost his son in the incident had his photo doctored by hate groups - showing him laughing after receiving compensation.",
      "People whose loved ones died in the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 - a maritime disaster that saw 304 people killed, mostly schoolchildren - have also for years been the targets of hate speech.",
      "The tragedy saw the government pay out an average of 420 million won ($292,840; \u00a3231,686) per victim - triggering comments that claimed this figure was unreasonably high.",
      "\"People who are living day by day feel the compensation is overrated and say the bereaved are getting 'unfair treatment' and that they are making a big deal when everyone's life is hard,\" Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, told news site The Korea Herald.",
      "In later comments to the BBC, Prof Koo suggested that economic stress and a competitive job market - particularly in the wake of Covid - has left many people feeling socially isolated, exacerbating the issue of hate speech.",
      "Many South Koreans, he says, now \"view others not as their peers, but as adversaries\", pointing to a widespread culture of comparison in South Korea.",
      "\"We tend to compare a lot... if you put someone else down, it's easier to feel superior yourself,\" he told the BBC. \"That's why there's a bit of tendency in Korea to engage in hate speech or make derogatory remarks, aiming to diminish others to elevate oneself.\"",
      "Mr Park says the families of the Jeju Air crash victims have been characterised as \"parasites squandering the nation's money\".",
      "By way of example, he refers to a recent article about an emergency relief fund of three million won ($2,055; \u00a31,632) that was raised for the bereaved through donations. That article was met with a flood of malicious comments, many referencing the erroneous suggestion that taxpayers' money was used for the fund.",
      "\"It seems like the families of the Muan Airport victims have hit the jackpot. They must be secretly delighted,\" said one such comment.",
      "Mr Park says these comments were \"overwhelming\".",
      "\"Even if compensation for the accident comes in, how could we possibly feel like recklessly spending it when it is the price of our loved ones' lives?\" he says. \"Every single one of those comments cuts us deeply. We're not here to make money.\"",
      "\"Too many people, instead of being sensitive, build their entertainment on others' suffering,\" he adds. \"When something like this happens, they belittle it and spew hateful remarks.\"",
      "Joshua Uyheng, a psychology professor in the Philippines who studies online hate,  says that hate is often \"directed towards [those] we believe are gaining some advantage at our expense\".",
      "\"We feel hatred when we [think we] are getting the short end of the stick.\"",
      "'Taking advantage of others' pain'",
      "In the case of the Jeju Air crash, political dynamics only made things worse.",
      "The accident came amid a period of political turmoil in South Korea, with the country reeling from suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock decision to enact martial law - an incident that politically divided the country.",
      "Many supporters of President Yoon's right-wing People Power Party have, without evidence, pinned blame for the crash on the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), pointing to the fact that Muan Airport was originally built as part of a political pledge by the DP.",
      "\"The Muan airport tragedy is a man-made disaster caused by the DP,\" read one comment on YouTube. Another described it as \"100% the fault\" of the party.",
      "Park Han-shin, whose brother died in the plane crash, says he has been accused of being a DP member and \"fake bereaved family member\". So extensive were these claims that his daughter took to social media to call them out.",
      "\"It pains me deeply to see my father, who lost his brother in such a tragedy, being labelled a 'scammer'. It also makes me worried that this misinformation might lead my father to make wrong choices out of despair,\" she wrote on Threads two days after the incident.",
      "Park Han-shin says he is stunned by how people seem to \"enjoy taking advantage of others' pain\".",
      "\"That's simply not something a human being should do,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"I am just an ordinary citizen. I am not here to enter politics. I came to find out the truth about my younger brother's death.\"",
      "While there are no perfect solutions to hate, experts say social media companies should establish policies on what constitutes hate speech and moderate content posted on their platforms accordingly.",
      "\"Online users should be able to report malicious posts and comments smoothly, and platform companies must actively delete such content,\" Prof Koo says. Law enforcement agencies should also take perpetrators to task, he adds.",
      "Reminding people of their shared identities may also help, says Prof Uyheng.",
      "\"The less people feel that they are on opposite ends of a zero-sum game, perhaps the more they can feel that tragedies like these are the shared concern of us all - and that victims deserve empathy and compassion, not vitriol and condemnation.\"",

    "summary": "Former surgeon Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec is accused of abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children, including Mauricette Vinet's grandson",
    "story": [
      "This story contains distressing details from the start",
      "When Mauricette Vinet speaks of her grandson, her voice grows warm with affection.",
      "\"He was a lovely little boy. He had a strong personality, for sure! But he always thought of others, always asked if he could help,\" says the French retiree, in her 80s.",
      "\"He loved to be out in the garden with his grandfather, picking green beans. He was a charming boy, Mathis,\" she adds.",
      "\"But, as you know, there was a 'before' - and there was an 'after'.\"",
      "Mauricette and her husband Roland are among the 267 plaintiffs who have pressed charges against Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, the French former surgeon who is accused of abusing almost 300 people - mostly children, and almost all his patients - over the course of several decades. The trial started in Vannes, Brittany, on Monday.",
      "Le Scouarnec and Mathis only crossed paths once, when Mathis, aged 10, was hospitalised overnight at the clinic in the small French north-western town of Quimperl\u00e9. Le Scouarnec - a mild-mannered, respected gastroenterologist - told Mathis' parents the boy had to be kept overnight for checks.",
      "It turned out Mathis only had a stomach ache, and he was sent home the next day. But Mauricette is convinced the brief hospital stay changed Mathis forever.",
      "\"The unease set in, little by little. It happened gradually in the first year; then he stopped being happy and became aggressive with everyone,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "There is no way to establish conclusively whether Mathis' troubles were linked to the surgeon. What is certain is that in his teenage years Mathis distanced himself from his family and started using increasingly hard drugs; later, he spent time in detox and rehab centres.",
      "Then, in 2018, police knocked on his door.",
      "They told him a man named Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec had been arrested the year before for raping his six-year-old neighbour. During a search of the surgeon's home, police uncovered stacks of diaries and hard disks in which Le Scouarnec appeared to list hundreds more victims. Mathis' name was among them.",
      "Mauricette said Mathis told her police then read out an excerpt of the diary to him, which seemed to detail abuse Le Scouarnec's inflicted on him during his hospital stay.",
      "\"Then they left. Mathis shut the door and was left on his own, with no help. And that was the beginning of a descent into hell,\" Mauricette says.",
      "The police visit helped Mathis make sense of flashbacks that had long plagued him, Mauricette says: \"His malaise finally made sense; he traced it to the source.\"",
      "Mathis pressed charges against Le Scouarnec, but the revelations sent him down a spiral which came to an abrupt end on 14 April 2021, when Mathis overdosed and died. He was 24.",
      "Mauricette and her husband pressed charges the very next day, and they are now listed as \"indirect victims\" of Le Scouarnec. They have attended court in Vannes, north-western France, every day since the trial opened on Monday.",
      "It has not been an easy listen.",
      "The testimony of witnesses - mostly close relatives of Le Scouarnec, now 74 \u2013 painted a picture of an apparently ordinary middle-class family which, behind the scenes, has been ravaged by child abuse, incest and sexual violence.",
      "Annie, Le Scouarnec's sister, said she had been \"taught to keep quiet\".",
      "This week, it was all brought out in the open.",
      "All three sons of Le Scouarnec struck an almost apologetic tone as they told the court about their happy childhoods with a cultured, intellectual father who may not have been particularly present but who was kind, patient and supportive.",
      "\"We had holidays, nice houses - everything that constitutes a normal family,\" said one.",
      "The youngest son \u2013 who said he stopped contact with Le Scouarnec in 2017 \"to preserve the image of him I have from my childhood\" \u2013 said he now \"looked upon everyone with distrust\" and never left his own toddler alone with anybody.",
      "\"I am always worried that if my father could do this then my neighbour could, my partner, anyone,\" the 37-year-old said.",
      "Later the middle son \u2013 a tall man in his early 40s who admitted he was a \"not totally abstinent alcoholic\" \u2013 shared his memories of being abused at the hands of his paternal grandfather, Le Scouarnec's father.",
      "He was shocked as he was told for the first time in court that among his father's alleged victims were some of his childhood friends.",
      "And, on Friday, a stunned silence descended upon the courtroom as Le Scouarnec admitted he had abused his granddaughter - his eldest son's daughter when she was under five years old. Moments after the revelation, the 44-year-old and his partner left the room to be assisted by a psychologist.",
      "Other witnesses sparked consternation in the plaintiffs. Due to their sheer number, they sit in a separate room \u2013 a former university lecture hall \u2013 and follow proceedings via video link.",
      "Christian D., a friend of Le Scouarnec now aged 80, often answered questions from the court sarcastically and repeatedly minimised the events at the centre of the trial, declaring that he could not \"afford to cry over everything that happened in the world\".",
      "Later, he insisted that he \"never saw anything, therefore had nothing to say\" about the devastating allegations against his friend. When he stated that he would take in Le Scouarnec if he was ever to leave jail, many alleged victims in the lecture hall got up and left their seats.",
      "But most difficult for Mauricette and Roland was the much-awaited testimony of Marie-France L., Le Scouarnec's ex-wife.",
      "It has been alleged that she was at the centre of the omerta that reigned in the Le Scouarnec family, as she was repeatedly made aware of her husband's obsession with children but did nothing to stop it.",
      "Many lawyers and plaintiffs now believe she could have spared hundreds of children from being abused. Le Scouarnec's brother - who was also heard this week - openly wondered whether she had been too enamoured by the lifestyle provided by her husband's salary to speak out.",
      "Marie-France has always denied this and, at the stand, was frequently defiant in the face of the accusations levelled at her.",
      "\"Catastrophe has struck: she knows I am a paedophile,\" Le Scouarnec wrote as early as the mid-1990s in his diary. \"Perhaps he was talking about his conscience,\" Marie-France told the court.",
      "She also suggested her five-year-old niece \u2013 who Le Scouarnec has been convicted of raping \u2013 had most likely \"manipulated\" her husband.",
      "\"She's devious, that one. She loves the attention,\" she said. Later, she complained that she was being \"blamed\" for everything. Only when she was shown an indecent photo montage Le Scouarnec made of their son as a child did she look visibly shocked.",
      "\"That was absolute theatre,\" Mauricette told the BBC, adding that Christian D.'s testimony had been \"vile\" and that she thought Marie-France was living in \"pure denial\".",
      "As the gut-wrenching events played out, Le Scouarnec sat in his box \u2013 mostly reactionless, but at times noticeably agitated, his voice cracking as he asked his sons for forgiveness. He flinched when excerpts of his diary were read out, and averted his eyes as indecent photographs he took of his nieces were shown.",
      "His lawyers have said he admits to the \"majority\" of the charges against him, and that he will explain himself over the course of the trial, which is due to last until June.",
      "The alleged victims will take the stand from next week; Mauricette and Roland will do so in April. \"I will look at Le Scouarnec and tell him what is deep in my heart - he killed my grandson,\" Mauricette says.",
      "\"Not with a gun, but he killed him,\" she adds. \"He's going to get 20 years, but his victims... will have to live with this their whole lives.",
      "\"Their sentences will be longer than his.\"",
      "Throughout the week, over in the victims' hall, people came and went, but the majority stayed for hours on end each day.",
      "As descriptions of trauma and abuse poured in, one middle-aged woman covered her face with her hand and kept it there a long time.",
      "Next to her, a young man rubbed his eyes repeatedly, then stood up and left.",

    "summary": "Scandal surrounds King Misuzulu's attempts to take a third wife - and to divorce his first one.",
    "story": [
      "The love life of South Africa's Zulu king has the country agog - and has scandalised his socially conservative subjects as he messes with tradition by seeking a divorce.",
      "Polygamy is part of Zulu culture, but King Misuzulu kaZwelithini has taken the unusual step of going to court to divorce his first wife, Queen Ntokozo kaMayisela.",
      "\"Everyone was puzzled. People were not expecting the king to go so far as to file for divorce,\" Prof Gugu Mazibuko, a cultural expert at South Africa's University of Johannesburg, told the BBC.",
      "\"In Zulu culture, there is no divorce. You are not supposed to chase away your wife,\" she said.",
      "Regarded as the \"lion of the nation\", the Zulu king is the custodian of age-old traditions that place marriage and polygamy at the heart of royal success.",
      "His role within South Africa may only be ceremonial, but he remains hugely influential, with a yearly government-funded budget of several million dollars.",
      "The monarch - who grew up in neighbouring Eswatini, studied in the US and came to the throne in 2021 - seems to court controversy.",
      "His coronation was challenged in court by his elder half-brother, who has been trying to snatch the crown from him.",
      "His second marriage appears to be shaky, his attempt to take a third wife hit the buffers and there are also reports of another dalliance with a young princess.",
      "However, the 50-year-old's troubled personal life used to be discussed in hushed tones - that is until he filed divorce papers in December.",
      "Prof Mazibuko acknowledged that historical records appeared to suggest that a Zulu monarch in the 20th Century had divorced one of his queens, but it had been a \"top royal secret\", given royal divorce is not the norm.",
      "\"If a marriage does not work out, the wife will still live in the king's homestead. She will be given her own space. She will not have a relationship with the king, but she and her children will be well-cared for.\"",
      "It was just before his accession to the throne - following the sudden death of his father and mother four years ago - that the then-Prince Misuzulu married Ntokozo Mayisela.",
      "The two were already a couple and had two children together, but according to another cultural expert, Prof Musa Xulu of the University of Zululand, the decision to marry appeared be be hurried.",
      "\"It seems as though he felt he could not be a king without a wife,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Queen kaMayisela came from an \"ordinary family\" - as many of the wives of Zulu kings do - in a small mining town in KwaZulu-Natal province.",
      "It was as a cabaret singer performing at a restaurant in the coastal city of Durban that she caught the royal eye, the academic said.",
      "Her senior status in the family was made clear at the king's state coronation in December 2022 when she sat by his side.",
      "But her position is now under threat, with the monarch saying in court papers that they have not lived as husband and wife for at least year and their marriage has irretrievably broken down.",
      "The palace followed this by sending out invitations for the king's wedding to a new bride, Nomzamo Myeni, set to take place in late January. The bride-price, known as lobola, had already been paid in cattle - a prized asset in Zulu culture.",
      "Queen kaMayisela did not take any of this lying down, instituting separate court action to halt the wedding, which was postponed as a result.",
      "Her argument was that the king - known to his subjects as \"Ingonyama\", meaning Lion - would be committing the offence of \"bigamy\" without first \"converting\" his civil marriage to her into a traditional Zulu marriage.",
      "But the judge threw out her case, saying she had had a \"turnaround\" in attitude as she had already agreed her husband could take other wives.",
      "He noted the monarch had already done so - marrying Nozizwe kaMulela, the MD of Eswatini Bank, in 2022.",
      "Prof Mazibuko explained that polygamy was not initially part of Zulu culture, in fact the first two kings were bachelors.",
      "But it was embraced by their successors - King Misuzulu is the ninth monarch of the Zulu nation - and has become part of Zulu culture.",
      "\"That's how we build families, especially the royal family,\" Prof Mazibuko said.",
      "Queen kaMulela comes from an influential family in Eswatini and the marriage was apparently arranged to strengthen the ties between the royal families.",
      "Yet it is unclear whether the pair are still in a relationship, as the high-powered banker has not been spotted at Zulu cultural events for a while - with speculation   their final marriage rituals have not been completed.",
      "The current king's various marriage problems seem to stem from the fact that tradition has not been properly followed.",
      "In the case of the first wife, he opted for a modern-day marriage, without a traditional wedding.",
      "\"For a marriage to be perfected under Zulu custom, there has to be a public gathering, with song and dance,\" Prof Xulu said.",
      "\"You, as the bride, must lead with a solo song and the bride-maids dance with you, and you carry a spear which you give to the king - and then there is no going back.\"",
      "This has left Queen kaMayisela without the protection of tradition - and only the offer of monthly maintenance of $1,100 (\u00a3850) for a year, though she was likely to demand more before returning to the life of a commoner, Prof Xulu said.",
      "In the case of the second wife, the academic said lobola had been paid in January 2022, but royal insiders suggest the king felt \"those who went to pay didn't have the authority to do so\" - plus this union has not been marked with a public ceremony.",
      "The fortunes of the would-be third wife, Nomzamo Myeni, remain unclear as the king failed to marry her in January despite the court giving the go-ahead.",
      "Prof Xulu said that in Zulu culture a \"postponed\" marriage usually never takes place.",
      "Though Ms Myeni is still being seen with the king, accompanying him to a state event last week where she was referred to as a queen, suggesting their wedding may take place once the king's divorce goes through.",
      "Yet as a commoner she would bring no powerful connections with her, which may be why one of the monarch's aides recently confirmed to local media there was \"a new queen-to-be\" - Sihle Mdluli, who hails from the royal family of a small ethnic group in South Africa.",
      "The aide suggested she might be named \"the mother of the nation\" - a title that would make her the most senior queen with her children likely heirs.",
      "But Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if that wedding also failed to take place, as the king's relationships all seemed to run into trouble.",
      "\"I am not sure whether he was ready to be king, and whether he has good advisers,\" the academic said.",
      "He pointed out that the monarch had also been behaving erratically in his public life, sacking several senior officials in his retinue.",
      "On top of this, he has installed himself as the chairman of the board of a financially lucrative land trust, of which he is the sole trustee.",
      "The trust was controversially established shortly before South Africa became a democracy in 1994, giving it control of about 2.8 million hectares (seven million acres) of land in KwaZulu-Natal.",
      "King Misuzulu has also suspended all members of the board, bar one, accusing them of being uncooperative.",
      "He did this against the advice of the government, which pointed out that as chairman he would be required to account to parliament about the trust's operations - something that would not be in keeping with his status as a constitutional monarch.",
      "The dispute remains unresolved, giving the government a major political headache as it tries to avoid going head-to-head with the king.",
      "Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if at some point a powerful rival faction within the royal family launched a fresh bid to dethrone him by asking the courts to rule that he is not \"fit and proper\" to be king.",
      "The monarch's half-brother, Prince Simakade Zulu, who is the late king's eldest son, has long coveted the crown, but his backers were outmanoeuvred by Misuzulu's allies in succession discussions.",
      "President Ramaphosa later gave Misuzulu a \"certificate of recognition\", paving the way for him to be funded by the government.",
      "But Prince Simakade's supporters did not give up - going to the High Court to declare his state coronation \"unlawful\" - and won.",
      "The court ruled that President Ramaphosa had failed to comply with the law, which required him to order an investigation into objections to Misuzulu's accession.",
      "The status quo remains, pending the outcome of an appeal.",
      "The scandals have the potential to weaken the king's position should it come to another tussle for the crown.",
      "Though Prof Mazibuko noted there had always been fierce competition for the Zulu crown - except these days it takes place in court instead of a bloody battlefield.",
      "\"He is not the first king to go through a lot,\" she said. \"I hope he survives, and everything settles down.\"",

But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (\u00a380,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".",
      "\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"",
      "Two years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.",
      "But now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.",
      "Corporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.",
      "The moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.",
      "Since assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "In the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.",
      "At first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".",
      "The making of a backlash",
      "Programmes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.",
      "Under names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.",
      "As the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.",
      "DEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.",
      "The programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs \u2013 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.",
      "But almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".",
      "More recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.",
      "The roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".",
      "Social media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.",
      "One of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.",
      "Another major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.",
      "The ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.",
      "Business under pressure",
      "The speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.",
      "Martin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "But not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.",
      "Surveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".",
      "So does it actually work?",
      "Much rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.",
      "Some research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.",
      "This research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.",
      "Google joins firms dropping diversity recruitment goalsMeta and Amazon scale back diversity initiativesApple boss says its DEI programmes may change",
      "Google joins firms dropping diversity recruitment goals",
      "Meta and Amazon scale back diversity initiatives",
      "Apple boss says its DEI programmes may change",
      "The problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.",
      "She cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.",
      "But Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.",
      "And when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives \u2013 like Walmart's equity centre \u2013 Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.",
      "Where studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.",
      "A mixed picture in education",
      "Supporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.",
      "Last autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year \u2013 43 \u2013 and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024.",
      "Colleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded.",
      "But the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision.",
      "For the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students.",
      "Because of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling.",
      "But another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective.",
      "Dartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release.",
      "Looking ahead",
      "It's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi.",
      "Michelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups.",
      "\"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\"",
      "But as to the question at the centre of her book \u2013 is DEI dead? \u2013 Jolivet says the answer is no.",
      "The companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits.",

      "She gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team.",
      "\"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\"",
      "But not everyone is reassured.",
      "Back in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain.",
      "She fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\".",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:05:52 -0500",
    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",

      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",

      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",

      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

      "The film brings a humanity to the strivings of Anora (who favors the name Ani), a young woman who realizes too late that virtually no one around her has her best interests at heart \u2014 not even her newly-hitched husband.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2014 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "A former NYU film student, Sean Baker had not slipped into the Hollywood industry like some of his classmates, including Todd Phillips (\"Joker\"), instead making small independent features (\"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine,\" \"Red Rocket\") that focused on people living on the margins of mainstream society, cast with both professional actors and non-actors.",
      "After contemplating \"a bro movie with Russian gangsters,\" he switched to a story of a sex worker in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach. He and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, moved there to absorb the atmosphere. \"We don't like to go to a place and say we're just going to get a surface view,\" Baker told the Associated Press. \"We really embed ourselves in that place. We talk to people. We get to know everyone. The research is us being there and soaking things up.\"",
      "Baker, who won the Directors Guild of America Award for \"Anora,\" based the film on research he did into the lives of sex workers. \"I don't want to say in any way that I ever faced the hardships of an undocumented immigrant or a marginalized sex worker,\" he said. \"But being an independent filmmaker for 30 years, there was a hustle. Up until fairly recently, I was struggling to pay rent.\"",
      "Madison told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Heavily influenced by 1970s New York films like \"The French Connection\" and \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,\" Baker shot \"Anora\" on 35mm. \"We're living in a day and age where the technology, analog meeting digital right now, actually opens up so many doors to the artists,\" Baker told Forbes. \"I mean, you can shoot on film and capture your images on this gorgeous medium, but then you have the digital tools to help clean up and perfect. We're living in a great time. I wish more filmmakers would appreciate the fact that using tools from both sides of years of technology is a wonderful thing.\"",

      "In the film's stirring opening scene, T\u00f3th arrives in New York Harbor, with a skewed view of the Statue of Liberty that portends an unequal assimilation into the promise of America. (Cinematography by Lol Crawley. Music by Daniel Blumberg.)",
      "Brody, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of a musician struggling to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" is nominated for his performance as T\u00f3th, who is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2014 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. But Toth's ambitions clash with his patron, who seeks in T\u00f3th a talent he wishes to dominate.",
      "In this extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Brody described his performance as T\u00f3th and the influence of his mother, the acclaimed photographer Sylvia Plachy: \"I've had a lifetime of influences and preparation so to speak to portray L\u00e1szl\u00f3 in this movie. It's a character that I relate to many things, and I see a lot of parallels in my own yearnings as an artist and in the yearnings of the people that I collaborate with. I can relate to how the struggles my mother has had to overcome in fleeing Hungary with her parents, my grandparents, in 1956 during the revolution and her journey coming to America and the sense of loss as a young girl and starting again. It's really shaped \u2014 I think she's an empathetic person by nature, but she has certain sensitivity and eye for others and those who are vulnerable, or outsiders, and captures that quite beautifully.\"",
      "Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Corbet's monumental post-war drama (which he co-wrote with his wife Mona Fastvold) is a challenging and invigorating epic, a three-and-a-half hour tale of an artist striving to create in the face of terrible external pressures \u2014 commercial, societal, marital. Though set for the most part in Pennsylvania, much of the picture was shot in Hungary, on a tiny budget (approximately $10 million), employing the rarely-used VistaVision process to blow up to 70mm. \"We cut every corner we could to make sure that every single cent was on screen,\" Corbet told Variety. \"It was a Herculean effort, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because it was just years and years of essentially working for free.\"",
      "\"It helped that the film was set in an earlier period, because there were places in Hungary that looked sort of lost in the past,\" Oscar-nominated\u00a0production designer Judy Becker told Variety. \"For example, the industrial area in Budapest looked very similar to the industrial area of Philadelphia in the 1950s.\"",
      "But despite the tight budget, Corbet was not sorry he didn't have more money: \"I never thought, 'I wish I had $30 million more,'\" he told Variety. \"There's a lot of strings that come with that kind of money. It invites lots of opinions. You have all these executives who don't trust the director and bury them in notes. What you get is something antiseptic that lacks a signature.

      "James Mangold's biopic expertly dramatizes the rise of Bob Dylan as a mythic figure in the folk music scene, and his transformation into a singer-songwriter who blurred genres and confounded commercial expectations. The film, nominated for 8 Academy Awards, is grounded by best actor nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his acutely-attuned performance as Dylan.",
      "In this scene, Dylan visits an infirm Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy) in a New Jersey hospital, being tended to by friend Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton):",
      "That meeting leads to Dylan's first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he is introduced by Seeger. The club's audience, including Joan Baez (played by best supporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro), is enraptured by Dylan's \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Jay Cocks, the screenwriter of \"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Gangs of New York,\" had penned a screenplay based on the 2015 Elijah Wald book \"Dylan Goes Electric.\" Mangold (whose films include \"Walk the Line,\" \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"Logan\") worked on revising the script, which expanded the characters of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Sylvie Russo (a fictionalization of Dylan's then-girlfriend, Suze Rotolo).",
      "Mangold described to the Hollywood Reporter his initial meeting with Dylan to discuss the film: \"He said: 'So what's this movie about?' And I thought very carefully, because I knew he didn't want a 20-minute answer. I said: 'It's about a young guy in Minnesota who's suffocating and feeling desperate and who leaves everything \u2014 friends, family \u2014 behind and, with just a few dollars in his pocket, makes his way across the country and creates a new identity and makes new friends, finds a new family and blossoms, becomes successful, then starts to suffocate again and runs away.' And he smiled and that was all. Like, he didn't have anything more to say, but I knew that meant, to me, that he didn't take issue.\"",
      "The film gets a lot right in terms of the period, the feel of Greenwich Village at its height in the folk music world, and the sense of shifting sands in commercial music. Production designer Fran\u00e7ois Audouy transformed downtown Jersey City into early 1960s MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. He also recreated Dylan's apartment based on hundreds of previously-unpublished photographs \u2014 from the exact chair Dylan had, to his Decca record player, his 1954 Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter, art on the walls, books and records. \"It was like stepping into a time machine,\" Audouy told Indiewire of the apartment set.",
      "Arianne Phillips, nominated for best costume design (she'd previously been nominated for \"Walk the Line,\" \"W.E.,\" and \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\"), told The Art of Costume, \"Unlike typical biopics that span decades, this film focuses on just four years. That precision was both a challenge and an opportunity for the costumes. \u2026 The film moves through a variety of locations and scenarios, but the time period remains consistent. There's no dramatic shift in technology, architecture, or cars. Instead, the focus is on Bob's evolution \u2014 his character arc.\"",
      "The film's wardrobe was broken down into three styles: his arrival in New York in 1961, the time around the release of his 1963 album \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,\" and the more mod figure he cut in 1965. \"Chalamet had about 67 costume changes,\" Phillips said, \"and we had over 120 speaking roles with principal characters averaging anywhere from 8 to 30 changes each.\"",
      "Though much dramatized in the film did happen \u2014 including a fistfight that broke out when Dylan plugged in an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival \u2014 there were some liberties taken. \"Dylan Goes Electric\" author Elijah Wald told the Guardian, \"The movie is full of things that didn't happen, but the way they happen in those scenes feels right to me. If Pete Seeger had been at Woody Guthrie's bedside when Dylan arrived and sung him a song, then said he didn't have a place to sleep, Pete would have brought him home for the night. None of that happened, but it's all true to the characters.\"",
      "Because of COVID, Hollywood strikes, and other commitments, Chalamet ended up waiting five years before \"A Complete Unknown\" could go before the cameras. He used that time to further study Dylan (whom he had never met) and his music. In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, Chalamet mastered about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script \u2014 determined, like the young Dylan, to make it great.",
      "\"I give 170% in everything I'm doing,\" the actor told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm giving it my all. Something like the Dylan project, these aren't watered-down experiences. I'm going Daniel Day-Lewis on all of them. I'm not saying in process, but I'm saying a level of commitment.\"",
      "He says he wasn't merely trying to imitate Dylan: \"No, totally that was the tension, for me, in doing a biopic on somebody so beloved and so well-known was \u2026 where does my heart and where does my soul fit into this? Can it fit into this, particularly with someone who was so masked?\"",

      "\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.",

It could take place in Washington, D.C., or Downing Street, or a big corporation where the CEO job is vacant. So, I think that's interesting on the surface, but on a much deeper level, I really connected with what [Lawrence] is going through. He says, 'I have difficulty with prayer.' \u2026 To overcome that and go through this crisis and refine the belief in what you do, [to believe] it has some purpose, I think a lot of us go through it at some point or another in our life. To refine the purity of your job, and refine the purity of your purpose, is a constant struggle. It's an interesting path to keep recalibrating. And it's actually a very healthy path to keep recalibrating. \u2026",
      "\"What the film really deals with is doubt and certainty \u2026 It doesn't mean that every cardinal, every character in the movie, acts to the best of their conscience. But they are certain in their beliefs, or they believe that what they think is right. Bellini has a certainty that this guy is wrong and that is a certainty as well.

Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the movie was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and won six.",

      "Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles' previous films include 1998's \"Central Station\" (an Oscar-winner for best foreign language film), and \"The Motorcycle Diaries.\" At last year's New York Film Festival, Salles said that the story of \"I'm Still Here\" was very personal to him because of his own history. The son of a diplomat, Salles returned to Brazil in 1969 after living abroad for five years: \"The country I came back to was very different from the country I had left, because it was now under military dictatorship, and I was personally pretty much at loss, really at loss, until I met this family of five kids, and it was Marcelo's family. Became really good friends with his sister Nalu, and I got embraced by this family.",
      "\"I've been in that house, you know, for almost two years on a constant level,\" Salles said. \"We drifted to that house because in it you could hear the political discussions that didn't exist anymore in the exterior of that place. You could hear the music that was forbidden. \u2026 And there were no barriers between, you know, adults, adolescents, kids. This was completely different from my house. So, I was very informed by that. The moment where this was broken up was for all of us who were in that house at some moment kind of severed a line. It stipulated a before and an after, which obviously has to do with the moment when an authoritarian state invades the heart of a family. And that stayed with me for years and years and years.\"",

Following an investigation, the school was closed in 2011; subsequent diggings unearthed unmarked graves, which revealed even greater evidence of the staff's cruelties.",
      "In this extended interview from 2019, Whitehead told \"Sunday Morning\" that his book's main characters, Elwood and Turner, represented different sides of himself: \"I have an optimistic part of me that thinks that things are getting better. We are making progress as a country, in terms of race and other things,\" Whitehead said. \"And then there's a pessimistic, or realistic, part of me that says, no, things never change, and we make some progress and then we slide back. And so, Elwood and Turner in their initial incarnation represented different sides of me.",
      "\"Elwood is 16, he's a straight-A student, he's been inspired by Martin Luther King, the civil rights marches. Every week, he reads Life magazine and sees the picture of his heroes. \u2026 And he sees himself as part of the new generation that can change the old order. And then there's Turner, who is an orphan. And he's been sent to [Nickel] 'cause there's nowhere else for him to go. And he lives by his wits. He's a survivor. And he sees the system as it actually is, unchanging, casually cruel, callous. And he doesn't believe in the same sort of enlightened goals of Elwood. [He believes in] making his way through the obstacle course, getting through a day without getting beaten, and then getting out of school where he can find some other survival tactic that works in the outside world. And so, they meet, and they have to survive but also consider each other's philosophies \u2014 what works, what doesn't, and how do you maybe perhaps integrate them.\"",
      "What makes the film adaptation of \"Nickel Boys\" unique is that director and co-writer RaMell Ross, a visual arts professor at Brown University who earned an Oscar nomination for the 2018 documentary \"Hale County This Morning, This Evening,\" employs a first-person perspective for most of the film; the camera serves as the eyes of Elwood, or Turner, throughout the story, so the audience directly experiences the sensations of the characters, which can be especially disturbing when they become victims of abuse.",

      "In a New York Film Festival panel discussion, Ross, who had always wanted to make a POV film, said reading Whitehead's book was profound for him: \"And in the process of reading, it was the process of being allowed to imagine in a way that I think a lot of American writers aren't focused on.",
      "\"The way that Coulson wrote was, like, concise and spare, [he] didn't over-describe, so it allowed me to imagine myself as Elwood and truly be visual in the world,\" Ross said. \"And so, that process led to the POV notion, and ideas around at what point in time did Elwood realize that he was raced, that he realized he was Black? Which is something that I would argue all people of color go through. It's a visual thing, it's a perceptual thing, and what a devastating thing in his life as you can see in the film juxtaposed against being a sentient-innocent child and being in awe of what it means to be embodied, and then to go out into the world and to be forced to adhere by this manufactured law. It's devastating.\"",
      "Shot with Sony's Venice (a full-frame digital camera not much larger than a DSLR still camera), to allow movement through tight spaces, the camera was worn on various rigs (chest mounts, helmets, SnorriCams), as well as handhelds. In many instances, the actors wore the cameras themselves.",
      "Cinematographer Jomo Fray, who won the American Society of Cinematographers' Spotlight Award, told the New York Film Festival audience that he did not think \"POV\" was adequate as shorthand to describe its effect: \"I don't think it was about being in the point of view, but it was actually creating an image that is at one point immersive \u2014 it brings us in as an audience into the world. At a second point, it is implicative \u2014 it implicates us in the world that the image itself is seeing. And as a third point, it's an image that has a physical danger to it, that the image itself is navigating, trying to go through spaces that are naturally hostile to it. So, we wanted to shoot these scenes not from outside but be inside of the scene. \u2026 It was fundamentally, totally different than anything I've ever shot before, conceptually and otherwise.\"",

      "Fargeat, a French filmmaker whose credits include \"Revenge\" and the TV series \"The Sandman,\" told Vogue magazine that the stylized horror was purposefully made to look unreal: \"From the start I knew I wasn't interested in depicting the real Hollywood but rather what it's about. It's about beauty. It's about success. Taking it out of reality was a way to make it timeless and thus universal, like the story could happen today, yesterday, or tomorrow \u2014 as well as anywhere.\"",

Basically that's how I grew up loving films, everything that [would] allow me to escape real life, which I hated, which I felt totally unadapted to, and very bored [with].",

      "\"So, that's it's even not a question where that I choose; it's just what I do,\" she said.",
      "The film has been recognized as an indictment of sexism and ageism, in a popular culture that denigrates women who have the temerity to get older. In an extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Moore referred to a line by Dennis Quaid's character making reference to a woman's fertility being tied to their value, and to their desirability. \"There's an aspect that [and I would say up until now] kind of put women at a certain age or time in their life as, 'Well, you're now relegated to this corral because you can't be that.' And I just don't think it's the truth. I don't think that is the truth of who we are as women as we get older. And I think again, like the film, there's a part of that that we as women have bought into, and so if we want to change this, then we have to change how we're looking at it, how we're holding it, and how we see ourselves. We can't wait for it to change on the outside; we have to be that change.\"",
      "Fargeat told the Associated Press that her film was a response to the limits of female representation. \"Our society, you know, has been built on 2,000 years of being kind of one way. And to make a real sense, it's still too tiny to me. That's why I also wanted my movie to be so excessive, you know, because I think this is what we need. We can't be shy with those issue because the weight of everything is huge. The weight of all that still creates so much inequality and so much violence.

      "The show \"Wicked,\" with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, and based on Gregory Maguire's novel about the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West, opened on Broadway in 2003. It won three Tony Awards. For the film adaptation, the show has been split in half (Part Two opens this November). Far from the candy-colored vaudevillian Oz that the 1939 classic projected, \"Wicked\" has a darker subtext about tyranny and civil rights. A rebellion builds against the Wizard and the increasingly autocratic rule coming from the Emerald City, which draws Elphaba (best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo) to become a resistance figure; her empathy leads to her becoming an outcast.",
      "At the center of the narrative is the connection between Elphaba and Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande). Their frenemy relationship begins at Shiz University, but evolves as they compete for the attention of the dean of sorcery (Michelle Yeoh), and of a hunk (Jonathan Bailey), and then join as friends to meet the Wizard.",
      "In this scene, the hunk, Fiyero, a transfer student at Shiz University, makes his case for living less studiously, especially as it affords more chances to engage in a rapturous dance number in the school's library:",
      "This behind-the-scenes featurette shows how Erivo performed her flying stunts while singing \"Defying Gravity.\" \u00a0And yes, the \"Wicked\" cast were not performing to pre-recorded vocal tracks; for most of the film, Grande, Erivo, et al, were recorded singing on set by live sound mixer Simon Hayes (an Oscar-winner for \"Les Miserables\"). While it's as impressive as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing live on set for \"A Complete Unknown,\" Bob Dylan wasn't dangling in the air from a broomstick.",
      "Hayes told Playbill.com, \"There's something within the breath and the cadence of the way that the lips are moving, the breath that you're hearing as someone's walking and singing live, that just sounds real \u2014 because it is real. There's also something within the acoustic of the voice that matches the set we see, because it's a real acoustic. It's not synthetic rebuilt digital acoustic.\" Hayes is part of the sound recording and mixing team nominated for an Oscar.",
      "Watch this featurette giving a more detailed look at how the sound of \"Wicked\" was captured:",
      "Speaking of the film adaptation, Maguire told CBS Boston, \"The fact that the story of 'Wicked' continues to be pertinent 30 years after it was first published shocks me, saddens me a little bit, because it's about social ills and political stress, but also encourages me because it means we're still looking for guidance and for comfort.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:58:11 -0500",
    "summary": "David Johansen, the gravelly-voiced singer, was last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls.",
    "story": [
      "David Johansen, the wiry, gravelly-voiced singer and last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls who later performed as his campy, pompadoured alter ego, Buster Poindexter, has died. He was 75.",
      "Johansen died Friday at his home in New York City, Jeff Kilgour, a family spokesperson told The Associated Press. It was revealed in early 2025 that he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumor.",
      "The New York Dolls were forerunners of punk and the band's style - teased hair, women's clothes and lots of makeup - inspired the glam movement that took up residence in heavy metal a decade later in bands like Faster Pussycat and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.",
      "\"When you're an artist, the main thing you want to do is inspire people, so if you succeed in doing that, it's pretty gratifying,\" Johansen told The Knoxville News-Sentinel in 2011.",
      "Rolling Stone once called the Dolls \"the mutant children of the hydrogen age\" and Vogue called them the \"darlings of downtown style, tarted-up toughs in boas and heels.\"",
      "\"The New York Dolls were more than musicians; they were a phenomenon. They drew on old rock 'n' roll, big-city blues, show tunes, the Rolling Stones and girl groups, and that was just for starters,\" Bill Bentley wrote in \"Smithsonian Rock and Roll: Live and Unseen.\"",
      "The band never found commercial success and was torn by internal strife and drug addictions, breaking up after two albums by the middle of the decade. In 2004, former Smiths frontman and Dolls admirer Morrissey convinced Johansen and other surviving members to regroup for the Meltdown Festival in England, leading to three more studio albums.",
      "In the '80s, Johansen assumed the persona of Buster Poindexter, a pompadour-styled lounge lizard who had a hit with the kitschy party single \"Hot, Hot, Hot\" in 1987. He also appeared in such movies as \"Candy Mountain,\" \"Let It Ride,\" \"Married to the Mob\" and had a memorable turn as the Ghost of Christmas Past in Bill Murray-led hit \"Scrooged.\"",
      "Johansen was in 2023 the subject of Martin Scorsese and David Tedeschi's documentary \"Personality Crisis: One Night Only,\" which mixed footage of his two-night stand at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle in January 2020 with flashbacks through his wildly varied career and intimate interviews.",
      "\"I used to think about my voice like: 'What's it gonna sound like? What's it going to be when I do this song?' And I'd get myself into a knot about it,\" Johansen told The Associated Press in 2023. \"At some point in my life, I decided: 'Just sing the (expletive) song. With whatever you got.' To me, I go on stage and whatever mood I'm in, I just claw my way out of it, essentially.\"",
      "David Roger Johansen was born to a large, working class Catholic family on Staten Island, his father an insurance salesman. He filled notebooks with poems and lyrics as a young man and liked a lot of different music - R&B, Cuban, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding.",
      "The Dolls - the final original lineup included guitarists Sylvain Sylvain and Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane and drummer Jerry Nolan - rubbed shoulders with Lou Reed and Andy Warhol in the Lower East Side of Manhattan the early 1970s.",
      "They took their name from a toy hospital in Manhattan and were expected to take over the throne vacated by the Velvet Underground in the early 1970s. But neither of their first two albums - 1973's \"New York Dolls,\" produced by Todd Rundgren, nor \"Too Much Too Soon\" a year later produced by Shadow Morton - charted.",
      "\"They're definitely a band to keep both eyes and ears on,\" read the review of their debut album in Rolling Stone, complementary of their \"strange combination of high pop-star drag and ruthless street arrogance.\"",
      "Their songs included \"Personality Crisis\" (\"You got it while it was hot/But now frustration and heartache is what you got\"), \"Looking for a Kiss\" (I need a fix and a kiss\") and a \"Frankenstein\" (Is it a crime/For you to fall in love with Frankenstein?\")",
      "Their glammed look was meant to embrace fans with a nonjudgmental, noncategorical space. \"I just wanted to be very welcoming,\" Johansen said in the documentary, \"'cause the way this society is, it was set up very strict - straight, gay, vegetarian, whatever... I just kind of wanted to kind of like bring those walls down, have a party kind of thing.\"",
      "Rolling Stone, reviewing their second album, called them \"the best hard-rock band in America right now\" and called Johansen a \"talented showman, with an amazing ability to bring characters to life as a lyricist.\"",
      "Decades later, the Dolls' influence would be cherished. Rolling Stone would list their self-titled debut album at No. 301 of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, writing \"it's hard to imagine the Ramones or the Replacements or a thousand other trash-junky bands without them.\"",
      "Blondie's Chris Stein in the Nolan biography \"Stranded in the Jungle\" wrote that the Dolls were \"opening a door for the rest of us to walk through.\" Tommy Lee of Motley Crue called them early inspirations.",
      "\"Johansen is one of those singers, to be a little paradoxical, who is technically better and more versatile than he sounds,\" said the Los Angeles Times in 2023. \"His voice has always been a bit of a foghorn - higher or lower according to age, habits and the song at hand - but it has a rare emotional urgency.",
      "The Dolls, representing rock at it's most debauched, were divisive. In 1973, they won the Creem magazine poll categories as the year's best and worst new group. They were nominated several times for The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame but never got in.",
      "\"Dirty angels with painted faces, the Dolls opened the box usually reserved for Pandora and unleashed the infant furies that would grow to become Punk,\" wrote Nina Antonia in the book \"Too Much, Too Soon.\" \"As if this legacy wasn't enough for one band, they also trashed sexual boundaries, savaged glitter and set new standards for rock 'n' roll excess.\"",
      "By the end of their first run, the Dolls were being managed by legendary promoter Malcolm McLaren, who would later introduce the Sex Pistols to the Dolls' music. Culture critic Greil Marcus in \"Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century\" writes the Dolls played him some of their music and he couldn't believe how bad they were.",
      "\"The fact that they were so bad suddenly hit me with such force that I began to realize, ''I'm laughing, I'm talking to these guys, I'm looking at them, and I'm laughing with them; and I was suddenly impressed by the fact that I was no longer concerned with whether you could play well,\" McLaren said. \"The Dolls really impressed upon me that there was something else. There was something wonderful. I thought how brilliant they were to be this bad.\"",
      "After the first demise of the Dolls, Johansen started his own group, the David Johansen band, before reinventing himself yet again in the 1980s as Buster Poindexter.",
      "Inspired by his passion for the blues and arcane American folk music Johansen also formed the group The Harry Smiths, and toured the world performing the songs of Howlin' Wolf with Hubert Sumlin and Levon Helm. He also hosted the weekly radio show \"The Mansion of Fun\" on Sirius XM and painted.",
      "He is survived by his wife, Mara Hennessey, and a stepdaughter, Leah Hennessey.",

Effectiveness was 32% for children and adolescents, from the CDC's U.S. Flu VE network of health care systems. That's down from 67% in last year's estimates.",
      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",
      "\"The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients,\" the study's authors wrote.",
      "Earlier data reported by the CDC suggested that this season's flu vaccines might be poorly matched against many H3N2 strains this season. Around half of infections this past fall and winter were H3N2.",
      "Scientists say that the protection offered by flu shots varies widely based on several drivers, not just how well-matched the shots are to what strains are circulating. A major factor is what kind of immunity people have from previous infections and vaccinations.",
      "Estimates for effectiveness in adults from the same network was 36%. That is similar to the 33% at this time last year.",

    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",

      "The recent sticky CPI report had reinforced the Fed's decision in January to\u00a0pause\u00a0on additional rate cuts, but today's data suggests that the central bank could still introduce more reductions this year. That said, \"thoughts of multiple rate cuts for 2025 may be overly optimistic based on today's data,\" Sharma added.",
      "Many consumers are also expressing their concerns about stubborn inflation, with a large majority of Americans telling CBS News polling that their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation. Some are expressing concern about their ability to save or buy extras, the poll found.",
      "Consumer sentiment is souring amid stubborn inflation and other headwinds, according to some recent measures. \"The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for Democratic-leaning consumers plunged to the lowest since the economic collapse of 2008 in February,\" noted Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email.",
      "He added, \"Consumers who are worried about tariffs, DOGE cuts and fears of deportations seem to be pulling back on discretionary spending.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:41:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",
      "Americans fund the Social Security Administration's services through their payroll taxes, or FICA contributions, noted Rich Couture, the spokesman for the Social Security General Committee of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\"The public paid for access to services with their FICA contributions,\" Couture said. \"We're at a 50-year staffing low in the midst of a customer service crisis \u2014 now is the time for us to invest in Social Security with proper staffing to make further improvements.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month.

      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregorys Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

    "summary": "Musk wants retired air traffic controllers to return to their jobs amid a shortage of qualified professionals.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, who has been tasked with leading the\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, is pleading for retired air traffic controllers to consider returning to work amid an ongoing, nationwide shortage of qualified air safety workers.",
      "The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX issued his appeal on X Tuesday, citing \"a shortage of top notch air traffic controllers,\" adding that \"If you have retired, but are open to returning to work, please consider doing so.\"",
      "The FAA has faced a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, while the agency's oversight of the skies has recently faced heightened scrutiny following a\u00a0string of recent aviation incidents. Currently, more than 90% of U.S. airport towers are understaffed, and do not meet standards set by a working group that includes the FAA and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday announced an effort to \"supercharge\" the hiring of air traffic controllers following a visit to an FAA training institute in Oklahoma, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "\"I witnessed firsthand the dedication, skill and rigor that our future air traffic controllers bring to their training and the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.\"",
      "The FAA announced an air traffic controller hiring window between Feb. 27 and Mar. 17. It said the hiring process will be more efficient by becoming a five-step, rather than an eight-step process. Starting salaries for candidates are also being by 30%; the average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year, the FAA noted.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",
      "Duffy has said he wants to extend a waiver to the current controllers who are near retirement age to help expand the workfroce.",
      "Earlier this month, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing air traffic controllers, told CBS the proposal is not \"an effective solution to addressing the chronic air traffic controller staffing crisis. \"In the next 12 months, we anticipate 49 ATCs across 35 facilities will reach age 56.\u00a0This is not enough to address the nationwide staffing shortage,\" the union added.",
      "\"The solution to the ATC staffing crisis is a long-term commitment to hiring and training and the retention of the experience of all the highly skilled, highly trained air traffic controllers,\" it added.",
      "Shortage goes back to pandemic",
      "In its Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, the FAA blames its struggle to staff air traffic control facilities in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA,\" the agency said in its report. \"At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities.",
      "There are currently a number of open air traffic control jobs on the FAA's website, including for air traffic control and traffic management specialists and at various stages of their careers. Robust training is required to become an air traffic controller, including the completion of training courses at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. According to the FAA, air traffic control specialists earn a median annual wage of $127,805, plus benefits.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gold-card-eb5-visa-5-million-immigration-oligarch-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

      "Americans say their outlook for the next year is also mixed. Right now, people are more likely to say the economy is getting worse than better. Current circumstances play into this too: those most concerned about affording food today are also more apt to think things are getting worse.",
      "Evaluations, as is typical, show splits by financial circumstances though, and may speak to broader divides in the U.S. economy and in the impact of inflation.",
      "Americans who report higher incomes are far more likely to say their financial situation is good and are much more confident about their ability to save \u2013 though the majority of them, too, say income isn't keeping up with inflation.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-status-2025-irs/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

      "\"I was very conscious of anyone who comes in \u2014 I don't want to see conflicts of interest,\" Duffy said on Feb. 19 from the FAA's ATC Command Center in Warrenton, Virginia. \"So [Musk] was talking to air traffic controllers, didn't plug into the system, but looked at the terminals that they use... They had a back and forth about what works well for you, what doesn't work well.\"",
      "\"[T]hey spoke freely about these are the problems that we have. And so it was nothing about the way that SpaceX uses the airspace. It was about how do controllers do their job,\" Duffy added.",
      "Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The George Washington University Law School, noted that federal regulations prohibit government contractors from having conflicts of interest, and warn even against the mere appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog focused on reducing government corruption, told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's close relationship with President Trump could amount to a conflict of interest.",

      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

      "Depending on the type of benefit and pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person. \"Some people's benefits will increase very little, while others may be eligible for over $1,000 more each month,\" the Social Security Administration stated.",
      "As Social Security benefits are paid a month behind, most of the affected beneficiaries will start receiving their updated payments in April for their March benefit, the agency noted.",
      "The benefits hike under the law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "\"Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible,\" Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a statement.",
      "SSA in late January cautioned that those impacted might have to wait up to a year or longer to reap the benefits of the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, which\u00a0became law on January 5, 2025. At the time, the agency noted that the legislation had not provided additional financing or staff to help implement the law or deal with the increased workload.",
      "\"The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation,\" Dudek added.",
      "Most eligible Social Security recipients will get their one-time retroactive payment by the end of March, which will be deposited into their bank account on record with the Social Security Administration.",

      "To learn more about the expanded Social Security benefits, including who is eligible and when recipients will see an increase in their payments, visit the Social Security Fairness Act website.",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been in the works for decades, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The Senior Citizens League said it was pleased that the timeline for implementing the new law had been moved up, given the high cost of living that affects so many of its members, according to Shannon Benton, executive director of the group.",

    "story": [
      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "DEI, aimed at promoting fairness in the workplace and opening career paths for people of color, women and other protected classes,\u00a0gained momentum\u00a0after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

    "summary": "Sharp drop in closely watched consumer sentiment gauge marks the biggest monthly decline in confidence in more than four years.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday, with inflation seemingly stuck and a trade war under President Donald Trump seen by a growing number of Americans as inevitable.",
      "The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index sank this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That's far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "\"The Conference Board survey is the 3rd data point in less than a week (after Fri's flash PMIs and Michigan sentiment report) making it abundantly clear that Trump-linked policy uncertainty is eroding confidence and tipping the economy (at least) into a slowdown (if not something worse),\" Adam Crisafulli, president of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a note.",
      "The seven-point drop was the biggest month-to-month decline since August 2021.",
      "Markets on Wall Street immediately dropped. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% in morning trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.7%. The Nasdaq declined 1.6%.",
      "Tariff concerns",
      "Respondents to the board's survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said.",
      "Since taking office in January, President Trump has threatened sweeping tariffs which he says will bolster the U.S. economy over the long term. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025.",
      "\"The Conference Board's survey mirrors the Michigan survey in showing that consumers' confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and employment,\" Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "\"The weakness of confidence strongly suggests that recent rapid growth in spending on durable goods mostly reflects households pre-empting tariffs,\" he added.",
      "The Conference Board's report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.3 points to 72.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.",
      "\"This index says that consumers are rattled. Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" analysts with High-Frequency Economics said in report. \"The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election might not be a coincidence,\" they added.",
      "Growing pessimism",
      "Consumers' view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.",
      "\"Views of current labor market conditions weakened,\" the group said Tuesday. \"Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\"",
      "Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. However, U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with cold weather taking some of the blame for a dent in vehicle sales and at retail stores.",
      "Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of healthy gains.",
      "Inflation has also remained sticky. So much so that the Federal Reserve has taken a more cautious approach to interest rates, leaving its benchmark borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. Fed officials have also expressed uncertainty over the new administration's policies.",
      "The most recent economic data and a pessimistic turn among American households does not bode well for the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "In a note to clients, Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote: \"Based on all the indicators showing declining consumer and business confidence and sentiment, we are expecting a slowing economy.\"",

      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",

Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",

An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",

      "HIGH REPRESENTATIVE VICE PRESIDENT KAJA KALLAS:\u00a0 Europe is a peace project. You know, it was created so that we wouldn't have wars between the members of European Union, and we haven't had. And, of course, also to do things together, cooperate more. You know, coming from a country that joined the European Union 20, 20 years ago. Then, we were actually, you know, pushed by the Americans, you know, you will not get into NATO, but, but Europe, the European Union, is something that you should join because it's, it's a good project also for the transatlantic relations. So I was quite surprised to hear a comment like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Do you know what the President meant by it?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, you have to ask the President, so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, it seems to reflect that there is some fairly high tension with the US at this point.",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Yes. The question is why? We have always been good allies. I mean, we have been working together and we have been friends and allies, what comes to the world in different parts of the world, what is happening. We have been cooperating, whether it comes to Ukraine, whether it comes to, also, Middle East. And we see- in the world, we see powers like Russia, North Korea, Iran, more covertly China, working together. And I think this is the moment where we have to work together as transatlantic partners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Secretary of State Rubio, you had announced you intended to meet with him while you were here, and then that meeting was canceled. Why?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Oh, well, it was said that it's a calendar issues. But I'm sure we are going to meet again, because we had very good meetings in Munich, and there are a lot of topics that we need to discuss. So we are going to meet in G7 in two weeks time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you don't think this was a slight?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, you have to ask Secretary of State, but, I mean, we have had such good encounters before, so I don't really read into you know- I know that we are not on top of our calendars. So, so you know things might happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, you're here now, France's President Emmanuel Macron was just here, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, President Zelenskyy is flying here. Are all of the European leaders coordinating? And if so, what's the message?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: We are coordinating. And of course, the message is there are several layers. One is that the fight that Ukraine is having is not only about Ukraine sovereignty, but it's much, much broader. It's about freedom of the free world, really. It is about the world where international law applies and the world where might does not make right. It is clear that Russia attacked Ukraine. There is one aggressor and one victim. And we need to really make sure that Russia doesn't attack again. And for that, we need to concentrate our efforts. I mean putting politically and economically pressure on Russia to stop this war, but at the same time also help Ukraine to defend itself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But what you just said, is factually accurate, Russia invaded Ukraine. But the Trump administration has decided now not to say that explicitly, arguing that the President needs negotiating room. Do you think that that's persuasive to Vladimir Putin?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, it is certainly, you know, a very strong Russian narrative that they want to- want to really push saying that, you know, oh, it's a conflict between two equal parties, you know. And to clear- I mean, create this chaos where it's very clear. It is very clear. One country attacked another country, very brutally with force, and is bombing Ukraine every day. I mean, President Trump says that he wants the killing to stop. I don't think that anybody wants the killing to stop more than the Ukrainians. And in order to achieve that, we should all put the pressure on Putin, because he can stop the killing by not bombing Ukraine and the Ukrainians so that they don't have to defend themselves. And that's why our plan, our policies, to really put the pressure on Russia. We shouldn't overestimate the power of Russia and underestimate our own power. We know that their economy is not doing well. I mean, their inflation is over 20%, their National Fund is almost completely depleted. They don't have the same revenues from gas and oil that they used to to fund the war machine. So actually, if we concentrate our efforts, we can put the pressure so that they would stop the war, not to offer them anything, you know, on a plate, in addition what they have already done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why do you think acknowledging who is responsible does matter?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, it does matter who is responsible, so who is accountable for this as well. And why it also matters is that we have the United Nations Charter where we have agreed how countries are, you know, interacting with each other. And it says very clearly that you can't attack sovereignty, territorial integrity of another country, and if you do, there are consequences. And why is it important? It is important for small countries in the world for whom this is the only thing that protects them. If we don't really defend this principle, then we're going to see all these developments that we don't want to see. Because all the countries who are afraid of their neighbors will want to go for nuclear weapons, because this is the only thing that protects them. It's not the international law anymore. And all the countries who have appetite for the neighbors' territory will want to have a nuclear weapon, because it is the only thing by- you know, threatening to use this weapon, you can have what you- what you want, because this is what Russia is doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet, at the United Nations this week, you pointed out the U.S. aligned with \"new friends,\" Russia, Belarus, Sudan, North Korea, at the UN. The U.S. voted with them and against a European backed resolution about Ukraine that demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops. The Trump administration would say, it's a UN resolution. It doesn't have a practical impact. Does it?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Well, yes, not so directly. It doesn't have a practical impact, but it- clearly, I mean, it is saying what kind of principles in the world we are supporting. And of course, we were co-sponsoring, together with the United States, the resolution to support Ukraine. And it was a surprise to us that U.S. suddenly changed the position. I must, you know, really point out that we had the resolution drafted together with the new administration, regarding the support for Ukraine. But when they met the Russians, something happened after that, because the behavior changed. So- so the question is, where do we go from here? Our will and- and wish is to work together with our transatlantic partners for the principles that United States has always stood for. I mean, I'm coming from the country that regained our independence in 1991. It was the time when, you know, Ronald Reagan was really pushing hard for, you know, fight for freedom, and- and we are so grateful for America for doing this. Because we got our independence and freedom back, and therefore also the prosperity and the well being of our people. So we are very grateful. And I'm not- and I don't want to- I don't want to see this- I don't want to let this go. I mean, that, America, you know, is- is not fighting for- for freedom and independence, and, you know, the principles, the basic principles, of the international law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Zelenskyy said Ukraine has intelligence that Russia plans to send troops to Belarus, and from there stage forces, either to attack Ukraine or another European country. Do you share that assessment that Russia will continue its march through Europe?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Russia has been investing more than 9% of its GDP on military. In comparison, European countries are spending 2%. I think my own country is spending over 3%, but- but I think America is spending something around 3 or 4% of its GDP. So if you're investing so much on the military, you will want to use it again. And that's why it is very important how we- how we act here. In 2008, they attacked Georgia. Nothing happened. There was not the strong reaction from the West. In 2014, they annexed Crimea and attacked Ukraine. There was not the strong reaction. So, you know, there was a ceasefire, but ceasefire only gave them possibility to regroup and rearm. That's why it is extremely important that we don't make the same mistake again. If there is a pause, so they are able to get their forces to gather again, we will just see more wars. Everybody wants peace, but the peace has to be a lasting peace. And for lasting peace, it has to put- the pressure has to be put on Russia so that they don't do this again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the- President Zelenskyy and President Macron of France have both talked about creating Europe's own army separate from NATO. Do you see that as likely?",
      "HRVP KALLAS: I mean, NATO is a defense alliance, and- and it is comprised of 32 different armies of, of the NATO member states. So, NATO structure is the military structure, and in terms of war, very important is, who gives orders to whom? So if you have, you know, those through- 32 armies that cooperate together, and you have one structure, then it's clear who gives orders to whom. If you have--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And right now, it's the United States to the Supreme Allied Commander.",
      "HRVP KALLAS: Yes, it is true. But the- but the structure- structure is there. I mean, command structure, but also communication, everything that is necessary, how we work together. So if we say that we create a parallel structure, then, you know, when, in terms of crisis, then who gives orders to whom? Because the armies are just the 32. So that's why I haven't supported a special European army. I'm just saying that all the armies that are there in Europe, but also in NATO, need to work together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the EU right now does have sanctions on Russia, and Secretary Rubio has pointed to that, saying, Look, Europe has a say in this. They're going to have to make their own decisions on sanctions. Do you think you can keep all 27 countries in line and can keep that pressure on Russia?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: We have managed so far and- and, of course, it's getting harder all the time, but we have managed to keep this unity. And I'm--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Hungary's Prime Minister threatens that--",
      "KAJA KALLAS: -- That is true, but at the same time, I mean, we are also thinking of different plans. Because, you know, for example, the sanctions, the frozen assets, for example. I mean, we see Russia causing damage to Ukraine every day. We know what this costs. So when we have the frozen assets, then it is, you know, the proceeds can be used for, really, the damages that Russia has caused to Ukraine. And there are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- This is 200 billion Euros--",
      "KAJA KALLAS: -- 300 billion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 300 billion euros of Russian assets that are frozen. But why isn't that already being tapped? Is it just because the banking system is averse?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: There are several arguments, and some- some countries are not in favor because of the different risks. But I think, you know, in the end, everybody will come to the same conclusion. It shouldn't be our taxpayers that pay for the damages caused by Russia in Ukraine. It should be Russia who pays.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the trade dispute that seems to be brewing between the US and the EU. President Trump said he's going to put a 25% tariff on imports, on cars and all of the things. Do you think that a trade war is avoidable at this point? Do you plan to bring a complaint to the World Trade Organization?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: We don't want the trade war with United States. I think there are no winners in trade wars. And I mean, yesterday, I was here and watching the news as well, and you hear the news that consumer confidence in United States is dropping. And you know, if you have trade wars, it increases the prices, and in the end, the consumers will pay for this. So- so it is- it is not- I mean, there are no winners in trade wars, and we don't want to start one. But of course, we will also protect our interest if a trade war is started against us.",
      "10:45:23",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been meeting with American lawmakers while you're in Washington. Do you get the sense that any of them are going to persuade President Trump to change his position on Russia?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: There are strong supporters of Ukraine in, I mean, both sides of the aisle and have been very, very much understanding what is going on. I don't know their relationship with President Trump, but I have seen the strong will that there is. Maybe this critical raw materials deal that President Trump is doing with President Zelenskyy will increase the economic interest of United States in Ukraine. That will, in turn, also give, I mean, the interest- security interest, to protect those economic interests that you have in Ukraine. So, so maybe that is one of the tools.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that critical minerals deal the US and Ukraine are supposed to jointly invest in doesn't have any security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "KAJA KALLAS: It doesn't have, and- and I mean, we have been saying that, you know, the security of Ukraine is also in the interest of United States, because, as we have been saying, it's much broader than- than just Ukraine. And when, you know, our American counterparts are talking about China, but at the same time saying that, you know, we can't step up to Russia. I mean, China is much bigger economy than Russia is, and much bigger army than Russia is. If you're saying that we can't step up to Russia, how can we, you know, really be able to step up to China then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And before I let you go, I want to ask you about Iran. Europe will have to make a decision in the fall about what to do if Iran doesn't agree to hold diplomatic talks about its nuclear program. What is your sense of whether Iran is going to negotiate away its program?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: We are going to have next Foreign Affairs meeting, Foreign Affairs ministers meeting, and we're going to discuss Iran. Our common position, how we approach Iran. It is clear the way Iran operates, I mean helping Russia in the war against Ukraine, but also their activities in the Middle East, that we have to have a much stronger stance when it comes to Iran. Because developing a nuclear weapon, it's extremely dangerous. And there is one of the points where we need to cooperate with the United States as well.",

    "story": [
      "There's at least one thing Americans widely agree on about President Donald Trump: they think he's changing the way the government works.",
      "But they're more split on whether that's for the better or worse.",
      "His approach to immigration and deportation continues to receive positive marks, and his border policies are seen as effective. A large majority agree there is some waste in the federal government.",
      "DOGE and Elon Musk's efforts divide the nation, though, as Americans foresee an impact from dismissing federal workers. Half the country thinks this will cut their services and remove essential people. Half think it'll save money.",
      "Either way, it isn't the main issue they want Mr. Trump focused on. They overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy, and far fewer think he actually is.",
      "The people who think Mr. Trump is changing the government for the better \u2014 who include a lot of Republicans and people who voted for him \u2014 overwhelmingly approve of things like his policies on deportation and his efforts to reduce the federal workforce. They would specifically give Elon Musk and DOGE a lot of influence.",
      "Those who see major changes for the worse \u2014 most Democrats and those who didn't back him \u2014 go the other way on all of this. Most of them don't think Musk and DOGE ought to have any influence. They see reductions in the workforce as eliminating essential workers and as having the effect of consolidating Mr. Trump's power.",
      "Most Americans see a wide range of potential impacts from the federal workforce reductions.",
      "For most Republicans, these reductions will lead to efficiencies and savings.",
      "For Democrats, it'll remove essential workers, and they also see political impacts: removing workers who don't support him and conferring more power on Mr. Trump.",
      "The public is on balance wary of Musk and DOGE's access to government agency data records. Democrats and independents think he has too much access, but Republicans either say he has the right amount or would give him more.",
      "That said, most do think there is at least some waste in the federal government, and that view crosses party lines. But they differ on how much and what causes it: Republicans think there is a lot, mostly caused by fraud in the system, while Democrats think there is only some, mostly caused by poor spending decisions.",
      "Is Trump prioritizing what people want?",
      "Mr. Trump gets narrowly positive ratings for handling the economy, but not inflation specifically.",
      "There's a big difference between what Americans think Mr. Trump ought to give high priority and what they think he is prioritizing.",
      "They overwhelmingly want Mr. Trump focused on the economy and inflation. That cuts across partisan lines. (Perhaps no surprise there, as they've been among Americans' top issues for years.)",
      "The percent who think he is giving a lot of priority to the economy and inflation, though, is far lower.",
      "Most think he is prioritizing the border, the federal workforce and tariffs, more so than inflation. And his policies aren't seen as driving down food and grocery prices.",
      "The focus on the border does help him politically: he gets approval on his handling of immigration, and most continue to back his deportation policy. Most say his policies are reducing the number of migrants crossing the border.",
      "That all leaves Mr. Trump's approval rating in positive territory, but more closely divided than a couple of weeks ago.",
      "In all, Republicans now overwhelmingly think things in the country are going at least somewhat well, which has driven up the overall percentage of Americans who are saying that since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Changes in international relations",
      "Americans also think there are major changes happening with U.S. international relations. And again here, a split on whether that is better or worse.",
      "Interviewing for the poll was almost entirely conducted prior to the Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Americans overall want to remain engaged on the world stage. Though few think the U.S. should take the leading role in the world, most do think it should work alongside its allies.",
      "And most see the nations of Western Europe collectively (Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy) as allies of the U.S.",
      "Half of Americans say they back Ukraine in the conflict with Russia, almost half are neutral.",
      "In interviews largely conducted prior to the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, few Americans thought Mr. Trump favored Ukraine in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.",
      "Those who personally support Ukraine overwhelmingly say Mr. Trump favored Russia, while those who don't pick a side overwhelmingly say he's treated them equally.",
      "His handling of the conflict is largely split along party lines.",

      "In a series of notifications sent to Congress late Friday, the State Department said it had signed off on the sale of more than 35,500 MK 84 and BLU-117 bombs and 4,000 Predator warheads worth $2.04 billion.",
      "The State Department approved Israel's purchase of Caterpillar D9 Bulldozers and related equipment for an estimated cost of $295 million. Deliveries by the Irving, Texas-based company are expected to begin in 2027.",
      "The Defense Security Cooperation released a statement confirming a munitions sale to Israel for an estimated cost of $675.7 million.

    "story": [
      "The head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, a judge in Washington ruled on Saturday, saying President Trump's bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, in a legal battle over the president's authority to oust the head of the independent agency that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired, even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \"only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic president Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Jackson rejected the Trump administration's claims that the special counsel's removal protections are unconstitutional because they prevent the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "The judge said allowing the president to remove the special counsel at will would have a chilling effect on his crucial duties, which include guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing.",
      "\"The Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing \u2014 by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,\" Jackson wrote in her decision.",
      "The Justice Department quickly filed court papers indicating it will challenge the ruling to Washington's federal appeals court. The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.",
      "The ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.",
      "\"I'm glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\"",
      "The judge said the special counsel has a \"unique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "\"If I don't have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\" Dellinger told reporters outside Washington's federal courthouse after a recent hearing.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger's firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.",
      "The Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \"a constitutional red line\" by blocking Dellinger's firing and stopping Trump \"from shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration's critical first days.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's advisers on Saturday morning were still uncertain how to salvage a mining deal with Ukraine, which had been intended as a key first step in a Trump strategy to eventually secure a ceasefire and peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "What began as a formal meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Friday \u2014 a confidence-building step in a path toward peace between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 devolved into a feud, with finger-pointing and accusations.",
      "The president's closest advisers \u2014 stunned after the debacle in the Oval Office \u2014 huddled around the Cabinet Room's oblong table for lunch, sources familiar with the events told CBS News.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were joined by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as the group rehashed what had just transpired.",
      "They shared disbelief over what one source characterized as Zelenskyy badgering the president. Another official said that, had Zelenskyy kept his disagreements behind closed doors, the blowup wouldn't have happened.",
      "During the contentious meeting, Mr. Trump and Vance took an aggressive and sometimes belittling tone with Zelenskyy after he expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement given that he had repeatedly violated ceasefire deals, including the Minsk agreements, leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In the hours after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House at the behest of Rubio and Waltz \u2014 with a joint press conference scrapped \u2014 there was discussion about whether the Ukrainian leader should fire whoever may have advised him on Friday's strategy. CBS News has reached out to Ukrainian officials for comment.",
      "Some of the Trump team's frustration targeted Zelenskyy's chief adviser, Andriy Yermak, whom they believed had undermined negotiations in recent days. Others said they weren't so sure it was an adviser problem.",
      "It wasn't the first time Zelenskyy had clashed with his American counterpart. President Biden once hung up on Zelenskyy because of the Ukrainian president's perceived combativeness, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. The friction was kept private and officials insist the dispute was over policy \u2014 not basic facts like which country had started the war.",
      "In recent days, there were signs the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal might not come to fruition. Neither side had signed preliminary paperwork that typically precedes an economic agreement of this scale.",
      "On Friday morning, Graham, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, and others met privately with Zelenskyy at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. They recommended that Zelenskyy avoid being contentious, say thank you and sign the deal without changes, according to people in the room.",
      "Some Trump advisers were nervous the deal might go south before the ceremonial signing, but felt confident by the time Mr. Trump greeted Zelenskyy. They viewed it as an economic security guarantee, a shared investment binding the U.S. and Ukraine for a generation, sources said.",
      "Zelenskyy had appealed to the West for ceasefire and post-war security guarantees, which were not explicitly included in the minerals deal. In Kyiv last month, Treasury Secretary Bessent had described the agreement as the foundation for a larger peace deal, and an economic partnership that would provide once the conflict is over a 'long term security shield for all Ukrainians.' However, the deal itself was not a ceasefire or peace agreement. Bessent described it as a very strong signal to Russian leadership of American commitment.",
      "Kyiv had hoped for security guarantees up front that would secure a pledge by the U.S. to help keep the long term peace and prevent Russia from invading again.",
      "The White House expected to finalize a version of the deal Friday that was essentially the same as one Bessent presented to Kyiv in mid-February. One modification: a provision was removed that would have placed a $500 billion cap on the value of minerals Ukraine would provide. The change was made at Ukraine's request because Zelenskyy disliked the narrative that Ukraine owed a certain repayment for past aid, people familiar with the deal said.",
      "\"We were trying to make it reasonable for them,\" one Trump adviser said. Trump's team privately discussed how they liked the new version better because it meant a deal could be worth more than initially conceived.",
      "The minerals deal was a concept Graham had circulated as an avenue to create a new, mutually beneficial relationship for the two countries. Zelenskyy had presented it to Mr. Trump, at Graham's urging, at a meeting at Trump Tower in September.",
      "But on Friday, staff quietly removed the formal ceremonial set-up from the East Room \u2014 a conference table and two podiums, and two sets of binders with unsigned documents.",
      "Zelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London to meet with sympathetic European allies. No plans had been made for Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to speak again.",
      "In the meantime, America remains the most significant military and financial backer of Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. There is $3.85 billion in military equipment already designated for delivery to Ukraine, and it is not clear if Mr. Trump will still clear it for delivery.",
      "\"They are fortunate it's not off already,\" a senior U.S. official told CBS News.",

      "Israel's government said early Sunday it supports a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza through Ramadan and Passover, though Hamas has insisted on negotiating the truce's second phase instead.",
      "The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office came minutes after the first phase ended, and as talks have begun on starting the second phase that's aimed at ending the war and seeing all remaining living hostages in Gaza returned home.",
      "The statement gives new details on what Israel described as a U.S. proposal: A ceasefire extension through Passover, or April 20. On the first day of the framework, half the hostages, alive and dead, would be released. The rest would be released if an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The statement said it was proposed after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff got \"the impression that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\"",
      "There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which earlier rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire's first phase by 42 days \u2014 doubling its length \u2014 saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "Officials from Israel and mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on starting the ceasefire's second phase in Cairo. But Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, told The Associated Press there had been \"no progress\" before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday. Hamas did not attend, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal's terms, fighting should not resume while negotiations are underway on phase two.",
      "Israel's new statement says it can return to fighting \"if it believes that the negotiations are ineffective,\" and it noted Hamas' refusal to accept the proposal for an extension of the first phase.",
      "However, \"if Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately enter into negotiations on all the details of the Witkoff plan,\" the statement says.",
      "Before Israel's new statement, an Egyptian official involved in the talks spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. The official said Hamas, Qatar and Egypt wanted to continue with the existing ceasefire deal, and they rejected Israel's proposal to extend the ceasefire for four weeks with a release of hostages every Saturday without officially entering negotiations on the second phase.",
      "The Egyptian official said the U.S. wants to start negotiations on the second phase but called for hostage releases during the negotiations. Hamas insisted on a full implementation of the ceasefire terms.",
      "The first phase, which paused 15 months of fighting in Gaza, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of people returned home to northern Gaza, aid into the territory increased and Israeli forces withdrew to buffer zones.",
      "Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that left about 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. Since then, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say more than half the dead have been women and children.",
      "According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead.",
      "The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January. Talks on the second phase were meant to start the first week of February. Israelis rallied Saturday night to urge their government to continue the deal.",
      "Hamas has reaffirmed its \"full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details\" and called on the international community to pressure Israel to immediately proceed to the second phase.",
      "Other challenges complicate the ceasefire's future. Israel has said Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah.",
      "Hamas leader Mohamed Darwish on Saturday reiterated the group is willing to hand over power to a Palestinian national consensus government or an Egypt-proposed body of technocrats not aligned with Hamas or Fatah. His comments came in an open letter to next week's summit of Arab leaders in Cairo. Hamas has dismissed Israel's suggestion that its leadership go into exile.",
      "Witkoff, speaking on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" last weekend, said that securing the release of the last U.S. national believed to be among the surviving hostages,\u00a0Edan Alexander\u00a0was \"front and center for us.\" Alexander was serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was abducted during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack,",
      "\"I know his parents,\" Witkoff told CBS News. \"We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home, and we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe.\"",

However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.",
      "When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.",
      "No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "Zelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported.",
      "Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.",
      "The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.",
      "What to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit",
      "Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.",
      "In a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.",
      "\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\"\u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.",
      "\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.",
      "\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.",
      "Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.",
      "Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"",
      "The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.",
      "\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"",
      "But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.",
      "\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.",
      "\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some federal workers received another email late Friday asking them to provide five bullet points of what they accomplished in the past week, sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The email shown to CBS News instructed federal workers to \"please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets describing what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"",
      "It also indicated that such an edict would continue.",
      "\"Going forward, please complete the above task each week by Mondays at 11:59pmET,\" the email read.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy and the Treasury Department were among the agencies that received it.",
      "However, unlike the first such email circulated to the federal workforce last week, it allowed employees who deal with sensitive information to opt out of a full response.",
      "\"Please do not send links, attachments, or any classified/sensitive information,\" the email read. \"If all of your activities are classified or sensitive, please write 'All of my activities are sensitive.'\"",
      "Earlier Friday, sources familiar with the directive confirmed to CBS News the new email was expected to come from individual federal agencies, not the Office of Personnel Management, as was the case with the emails sent last week. That government-wide directive caused confusion as to whether a response was required \u2014 and the possible ramifications of not answering.",
      "With this new round of emails, OPM advised agencies to send the messages themselves, and each department has the discretion to decide whether to do so, sources told CBS News earlier Friday. The emails are part of a strategy to have agencies account for their employees' work each week and report it back to the government's human resources agency, though no decision has been made about whether the messages will go out weekly, the sources said.",
      "After the first Musk-driven OPM email went out last week, DHS employees were told not to respond. On Saturday, DHS sent out an email instructing employees to internally submit five bullet point accomplishments that \"supplements the intent\" of OPM's \"recent guidance while remaining internal to DHS.\" Workers were instructed not to include classified information. DHS employees have until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time Monday to respond.",
      "Since returning to the White House, President Trump has made reducing the size of the federal government a key part of his second-term agenda. He tasked Elon Musk to lead the cost-cutting effort through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, though the billionaire is not the administrator of the task force. The White House confirmed earlier this week that Amy Gleason, who worked at the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE, is its acting administrator.",
      "But Musk and his team have roiled the federal government with their initiative; as thousands of probationary federal workers were fired, DOGE employees have sought access to departments' data systems housing sensitive information and work at some independent agencies has ground to a halt.",
      "Their actions have sparked numerous lawsuits, and on Thursday, a federal judge in California found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful.",
      "The initial round of emails sent to the federal workforce last Saturday came from OPM with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" It directed recipients to reply with five examples of what they accomplished in the prior week and include their bosses in the response. Government employees had until 11:59 p.m. Monday to answer and were told not to \"send any classified information, links, or attachments.\"",
      "Musk had initially warned on social media that a failure to respond \"will be taken as a resignation,\" but several agencies, including the FBI and Departments of State, Homeland Security and Defense, told their employees to ignore the request. OPM then told human resources officials from departments Monday that it was up to each agency to decide how they would handle the emails to their workers.",

    "story": [
      "Washington, D.C. \u2014 The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border illegally in President Trump's first full month in office plunged to a level not seen in at least 25 years, according to preliminary government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "Last month, Border Patrol recorded about 8,450 apprehensions of migrants who crossed into the country unlawfully between official entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border, the statistics show.",
      "On some days during a record spike in illegal crossings under the Biden administration, Border Patrol recorded more than 8,000 apprehensions in a single day.",
      "February's total, which could be adjusted when the government officially publishes the statistics, would be the lowest monthly apprehensions tally recorded by Border Patrol since at least fiscal year 2000, the last period with public monthly data. The final tallies usually don't deviate much from the preliminary figures.",
      "Over the past 25 years, the only time monthly apprehensions came close to the level recorded in February was in April 2017, when Border Patrol apprehended 11,000 migrants at the southwest border, agency data show.",
      "While monthly data before fiscal year 2000 is not publicly available, the last time Border Patrol averaged roughly 8,000 apprehensions per month over a year was in fiscal year 1968, according to historical statistics.",
      "Illegal crossings along the U.S. southern border have been trending downward over the past year, including under the Biden administration, after spiking to an all-time high in late 2023.",
      "They first dropped in early 2024 after Mexican officials expanded efforts to stop migrants from reaching the U.S. border and then fell further in the summer following former President Biden's move to sharply restrict access to the asylum system.",
      "But the reduction in illegal immigration has been precipitous since Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "In January, Border Patrol agents at the Mexican border recorded 29,000 apprehensions, down 38% from 47,000 in December. The drop from January to February was even more pronounced, amounting to a roughly 70% decrease.",
      "Trump administration officials have credited their sweeping, government-wide immigration crackdown for the dramatic decrease in unlawful crossings.",
      "At the U.S.-Mexico border, the Trump administration has empowered federal officials to swiftly deport migrants without hearing their asylum claims, under the premise that the country is facing an \"invasion.\"",
      "U.S. law says migrants on American soil generally have the right to claim asylum to delay or halt their deportation. Trump administration officials have argued the system has been systematically abused by smugglers and economic migrants, who don't qualify for asylum.",
      "Mr. Trump has also directed the American military to help with immigration enforcement, deploying thousands of additional troops to the southern border and tasking military planes with deporting migrants.",
      "While Biden also moved to curtail asylum during his last year in office, Mr. Trump's unprecedented actions are far more restrictive.",
      "Unlike the Biden administration, for example, the Trump administration is not processing, in any significant capacity, asylum-seekers at official border entry points. In fact, a Biden-era system that facilitated that processing through a government app was quickly terminated.",
      "The Trump administration is also considering adding another layer to its restrictions at the border, making plans to invoke a public health law known as Title 42 to summarily expel migrants on the grounds that they could spread diseases like tuberculosis.",

      "A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that it had ended more than 90% of its USAID contracts, retaining only those that it believes make America stronger, safer and more prosperous.

    "summary": "Ukrainian officials reached out to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track, but President Trump was unwilling to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy further today, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. military aid to Ukraine could be in jeopardy after a contentious Oval Office meeting Friday between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to administration officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "The day started on a positive note, with Mr. Trump joking with Zelenskyy, a guest book signing and warm conversation in the Oval Office.",
      "But the episode has raised questions about whether Zelenskyy can move forward toward a peace deal, and whether the U.S. will or should pause aid to Ukraine.",
      "Though several of the president's allies have called on Zelenskyy to step down or \"change,\" Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, according to the officials, who said there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than its current president.",
      "Multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy left the White House Friday afternoon to ask how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "No phone calls between Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the officials said.",
      "Still, the administration believes that the Ukrainian leader has put his country in a terrible position and that he missed out on a huge opportunity to have the U.S. as a business partner, with U.S. companies working on helping Ukraine monetize their mineral resources, such as gas and oil, aluminum and tritium and others.",
      "The minerals deal was set to be signed with much pomp and circumstance, and it was the first step in what Mr. Trump foresaw as a progression towards peace. According to the officials, Mr. Trump fully intended to sign the minerals deal. Two official binders were prepared and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Ukrainian counterpart, Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump were going to sit at a conference table in the East Room to trumpet the success.",
      "But there were suspicions before Zelenskyy arrived on Friday that it might fall apart. The Trump administration had been pushing for weeks for a minerals deal signing at the ministerial level, but Ukraine refused. Zelenskyy wanted security guarantees in exchange.",
      "And following the Oval Office meeting, Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track, but Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the officials said.",
      "When Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mr. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz went to the Roosevelt Room, where Zelenskyy and his team were holding after the Oval Office meeting, Rubio made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counter-productive, the officials said. Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake and had done a disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.",
      "U.S. officials thought negotiations would be much harder with Russian President Vladimir Putin and have been in disbelief that it has been Zelenskyy who has been difficult, the sources said. Trump officials were concerned the Russians would come with all-or-nothing demands during a recent meeting in Riyadh, but they didn't. The negotiators had reasonable requests for Rubio and Waltz, but instead it has been Ukraine that has had maximalist demands, according to the Trump officials.",
      "The White House is now uncertain if they can get Russia and Ukraine to end the war that has dragged on for more than three years, the officials told CBS News.",
      "Asked how Zelenskyy can repair this, the Trump officials said the Ukrainian leader needs to explicitly say he wants a ceasefire, because it's now unclear to the administration that he would ever sign anything with Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader, speaking to Fox News' Bret Baier later Friday, rejected the notion that he wouldn't sign a peace agreement with Putin. He said, \"We will have negotiations,\" and reiterated that Ukraine must have security guarantees.",
      "\"We are ready for peace but we have to be in a strong position,\" Zelenskyy said. He also expressed confidence that the relationship with Mr. Trump can be salvaged.",
      "The U.S. has made it clear to Ukraine that Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership before talking about security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, if it happened, the officials disclosed. There have been no discussions among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, have all been talking to Mr. Trump and his team about troop presence in Ukraine and what the security guarantees would look like.",
      "Meanwhile, a defense official said there have been U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine since Jan. 20, but no new packages have been announced. What was in the pipeline committed by the Biden administration has been continuing. It sometimes takes months for certain items, like vehicles, to arrive in Ukraine.",
      "There is $3.85 billion left in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, according to two U.S. officials. This is spending authority, not appropriated money, which means that it is up to the White House, not Congress, to determine whether to release that or not. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere, it is just authority to give Ukraine weapons from U.S. stockpiles. It is up to Mr. Trump to decide whether to send Zelenskyy the remainder of that weaponry.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Rubio and could potentially be held or released. The State Department under the Trump administration has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",

He was joined by Walter Davis, a founding member of the holding company, Peachtree Providence Partners.",
      "\"It is incredibly important for us to figure out how to unlock capital for disadvantaged communities,\" Scott explained. \"My goal is to set the kind of parameters that allows for $1 trillion of capital to be set free in disadvantaged communities in the next 10 years. I believe we can get to $2 trillion!\"",
      "Scott pointed to his own experience as a small business owner when he ran an insurance firm prior to entering politics.",
      "\"That's called the American way, or at least it's supposed to be the American way,\" Scott said. \"And I aim to make sure that, from a banking perspective, we have the flexibility of regulators so that small business owners with a good plan, with decent credit, have access to the capital to start hiring people from their own communities.\"",
      "Scott has made economic development a core pillar of his policy agenda, which includes affordable housing, education, low tax rates and financial literacy and inclusion. He cited proposed legislation, such as the Road to Housing Act that seeks to expand housing supply, and the Empowering Main Street in America Act, meant to streamline access to capital access for more entrepreneurs.",
      "\"Those two things, housing and small businesses, transform minority communities and disadvantaged communities all across America,\" Scott said.",
      "The Republican lawmaker also continues to champion the expansion of his Opportunity Zones initiative, bipartisan legislation passed as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act he spearheaded to provide federal tax incentives to economically distressed areas. The initiative has generated more than $85 billion in investment, according to Scott.",
      "\"He's the father of Opportunity Zones,\" President Trump touted this month during a White House Black History Month reception. \"He came into the White House, the Oval Office, with this idea, and it's probably the number one economic development project ever in our country.\"",
      "In an op-ed Friday for Fox News, Scott said he wants to unlock opportunities for others just as his family sacrificed for him.",
      "Scott told the story of his grandfather, who was born in 1921 and dropped out of school when he was 8 years old. He said he never learned to read or write, but had a photographic memory and once advised him that \"I could be a victim or I could be victorious, but I couldn't be both\"",
      "\"A man who had no access, lived long enough to watch me beat Strom Thurmond's son for Congress in the place where the Civil War started,\" Scott reflected. \"Our relatives have paid too high a price for us not to see discomfort as a motivating factor for our success.\"",

    "summary": "The move supercharges RFK Jr.'s authority to implement health policy changes.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended a longstanding transparency rule on Friday, supercharging his authority to change policies in areas ranging from Medicaid to the National Institutes of Health without advance notice to the public.",
      "Dubbed the \"Richardson Waiver\" after the former health secretary who issued the rule in 1971, the policy Kennedy repealed had required regulations related to property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts to go through the federal \"rulemaking\" process.",
      "The law governing rulemaking usually exempts such regulations, but in response to calls at the time to close the exemption, officials voluntarily waived it. This meant that, until now, they would go through the process of notifying the public of their proposals and asking for comments before imposing changes.",
      "\"The extra-statutory obligations of the Richardson Waiver impose costs on the Department and the public, are contrary to the efficient operation of the Department, and impede the Department's flexibility to adapt quickly to legal and policy mandates,\" Kennedy said in a filing announcing the end of the waiver.",
      "Now health agencies no longer need to go through the notice and comment process for many policy changes about grants and benefits. This includes new rules that could otherwise be stymied by backlash during a public comment period, like potentially adding in work requirements to Medicaid or redrawing how the National Institutes of Health funds research.",
      "\"It's hugely important, because getting rid of the Richardson Waiver means that the agency can move a lot faster to implement big new policy changes,\" said Samuel Bagenstos, professor of law at the University of Michigan.",
      "Bagenstos previously worked as the general counsel for HHS under the Biden administration. He said following the policy was a major hurdle, bogging down proposals that might have otherwise been finalized.",
      "\"Courts have held HHS to that waiver, so it's not just something they could ignore,\" he said. \"If you think about HHS, it's a $1.7 trillion department. The overwhelming majority of what it does is grants and benefits.\"",
      "The waiver was also cited earlier this month by state attorneys general as one argument in their legal challenge seeking to block the National Institutes of Health's controversial cuts to research funding. They quoted the first Trump administration supporting the waiver in a 2020 post by the department to the Federal Register.",
      "\"The Department believes that its decision-making ought to be as transparent as appropriate to better enable the citizenry to comment on its proposed rules and demonstration projects,\" Trump HHS officials had said.",
      "The Council on Governmental Relations, a group that represents research universities and other institutions, criticized Kennedy's decision Friday. The group's president, Matt Owens, told CBS News in a statement that it \"flies in the face of the Trump Administration's professed mandate for greater transparency.\"",
      "\"For decades HHS policies affecting public health and research institutions have benefitted from public stakeholder participation in the policy process. Public input is an essential element of the policy process that reflects our nation's democratic principles,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's reversal does not end public comment for all changes tied to benefits overseen by the department. A separate law requires changes to Medicare coverage to go through public comment.",
      "Bagenstos predicted that Friday's attempt to end the waiver would also be challenged, though he acknowledged Kennedy had the authority to seek to end it.",

      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost touchdown kicks off two weeks of around-the-clock research by NASA science and technology payloads.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium -- the Sea of Crises -- in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket last January was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent its first lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "The appropriately-named Resilience took a different route to the moon than Blue Ghost, a low-energy trajectory utilizing lunar gravity to help reach the desired descent orbit for a landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6. The company's first lander, Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it tipped over on touchdown and was unable to complete all its planned research.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a small rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lunar-lander-athena-launch-ice-search-on-moon/",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 20:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines launches its second moon lander, which will use NASA and commercially developed tools to search for ice in the moon's crust.",
    "story": [
      "With two commercial moon landers already on their way, Houston-based Intuitive Machines launched its second robotic lander atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday, the centerpiece of a multi-element NASA-sponsored mission to help pave the way for human expeditions.",
      "The workhorse rocket's nine first-stage engines roared to life at  7:16 p.m. EST, pushing the booster away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center atop 1.9 million pounds of thrust and a brilliant jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",
      "Given the on-time launch and assuming no major problems, the Athena lander is expected to descend to touchdown on a flat mesa-like structure known as Mons Mouton on March 6, setting down just 100 miles from the moon's south pole \u2014 closer than any other spacecraft has attempted.",
      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "But according to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 0.004% chance of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. NASA on Feb. 24 said, \"There is no significant potential for this asteroid to impact our planet for the next century.\"",

      "\"We can calculate the energy ... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If such an explosion occurred over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "Aside from the nearly 0% chance the asteroid will miss Earth, the good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare if something were to change.",

      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",

      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",

It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "DEI, aimed at promoting fairness in the workplace and opening career paths for people of color, women and other protected classes,\u00a0gained momentum\u00a0after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

    "summary": "Cuts to the U.S. cybersecurity agency and FBI affected the federal workers tasked with stopping foreign interference in elections.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:19:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A 9-year-old's mission to get a bionic arm led to a story about the power of kindness \u2014 and an inspiring new friendship.",
    "story": [
      "Remi Bateman was born without her left forearm and hand but she doesn't let it slow her down.",
      "Now 9 years old, Bateman is busy riding her bike and scooter around her neighborhood in Utah \u2014 and she's got her sights set on doing even more daily tasks, like cutting her own food and doing her own hair.",
      "Remi has been using a silicone prosthesis, covered by her health insurance, since she was 6 months old. While the prosthetic is helpful, it's heavy and doesn't give her the ability to move fingers.",
      "\"Her current prosthetic is pretty stationary and doesn't do a lot,\" her mother, Jami, told \"CBS Mornings.\" The hand on Remi's prosthesis was molded into a plastic fist.",
      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",
      "Like many Americans with medical needs not covered by insurance, the Batemans turned to crowdsourcing.",
      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",
      "\"He told me he would pay for Remi's hand in cash,\" said Jami.",
      "And that's where the story takes a turn.",
      "Paying it forward",
      "With Schoonover's gift, Jami realized they still had $24,000 in donations. She asked her daughter what she wanted to do with it.",
      "\"Help more kids,\" Remi enthusiastically replied. \"So people can actually have a life-changing arm like me.\"",
      "Across the country in Maryland, 9-year-old Tyraun \"Taj\" Johnson was also trying to raise money for a Hero Arm. He was born with a partial left hand. His family worked hand specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine to look at surgery and different prosthesis options to give him some usage of his left hand. They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",
      "\"You're telling me that a kid able to function with daily tasks \u2013 something as small as feeding themselves, getting dressed...You're telling me that that's not medically necessary?\" his mother, Kaitlin Skinner, asked.",
      "\"I would give Taj my left hand if I could,\" Kaitlin added.",
      "The family started lemonade stands to raise the money for the bionic arm. In four months, they had only made $1,500.",
      "Then they got a life-changing call from Remi's mom. The Bateman's offered to use the donations they received for Remi's arm for Taj's Hero Arm.",
      "Open Bionics helped connect the families. Samantha Payne, co-founder of Open Bionics, told CBS News clinicians spend a lot of time assisting families in appealing insurance denials.\u00a0 \"The technology is 20 years old and has been tested,\" added Payne.",
      "A dream come true",
      "Kaitlin was brought to tears by the Batemans' generous offer and thanked them for making Taj's dream come true.",
      "\"Taj got teary eyed when he saw a video of Remi holding a fork with the Hero Arm,\" Kaitlin said. One of the things Taj is most looking forward to is playing sports.",
      "Kaitlin recently drove to New York City with Taj to meet Daniel Green, upper limb prosthetist at Open Bionics, who will make the mold that will become Taj's Hero Arm. While in New York, Taj had a surprise visitor: Remi and her mom. They arrived at our invitation.",
      "A new friendship forged through the kindness of strangers. Remi and Taj plan to meet again during the summer.",
      "\"If we have a playdate with our [Hero] robot arms, we could be like Ironman,\" Remi said.",
      "Donations for Remi continued to pour in. So she's continued to pay it forward, using the fund to help two more 11 year olds fund their Hero Arms after insurance denied their claims.",

    "summary": "The investor who was close friends with the Washington Post publisher talks about the woman who became a pivotal figure in Washington politics, whose story is told in a new documentary, \"Becoming Katharine Graham.\"",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett rarely gives interviews. But also rare is his friendship with the late, trailblazing publisher of the Washington Post, Katharine Graham. \"If there's any story that should be told, it should be her story,\" he said. \"If I was a young girl, I'd want to hear that story. It would change my self-image.",
      "\"She was one of a kind, and she was terrified of the job,\" Buffett said. \"She knew she could do things, but she'd been told all her life that she wasn't [allowed], and that females didn't do things. I mean, her mother told her, 'Nobody's interested in listening to you.' And so, all of a sudden, here she is, and she had an all-male board that was waiting for her, and all they wanted was her to stay home and cash the dividend checks.\"",
      "Graham was thrust into the role, taking over the company, after her husband, Philip Graham, died by suicide. She was then the center of some of the century's biggest stories. She made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers that helped lead to the end of Vietnam War. It was Graham who supported the investigative journalism that led to President Nixon's resignation after Watergate.",
      "All this in spite of the fact that, Buffett said, Graham had had drummed into her head the idea, \"Only men can succeed at business.\"",
      "Graham herself once said, \"The worst handicap women work under is the self-inflicted one \u2013 that is, if you've grown up thinking of yourself as a second-class citizen, that you tend always to put yourself down.\"",
      "Graham's journey from housewife to the first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company is laid out in a new documentary, \"Becoming Katharine Graham,\" now streaming on Amazon Prime.",
      "And at the center of the story is an unlikely friendship that began on June 4, 1973, when Buffett sent Graham a letter after buying a significant amount of the Washington Post Company's stock. \"I said, 'I'll never buy another share unless you personally okay it,' and I signed a document. Then we became friends.\"",
      "In the documentary, Graham recalled of Buffett: \"He used to come to board meetings with about 20 annual reports, and he would take me through these annual reports. I mean, it was like going to business school with Warren Buffet.\"",
      "Asked why he invested in the Post to begin with, Buffett replied, \"It was ridiculously cheap. It was a super bargain. It was worth at least $500 million and was selling for $100 million.\"",
      "Katharine Graham's son, Don Graham, a former publisher of the Post, said that Buffett was the greatest thing in business that ever happened to Katharine Graham.",
      "Buffett said, \"She needed somebody to reassure her.\"",
      "I asked, \"What were the things you would say to her to boost her confidence?\"",
      "\"The biggest thing I said is, when you look in the mirror, it's a funhouse mirror because you're seeing it for the eyes of what the males are telling you about it,\" Buffett replied. \"So, my job is to turn that funhouse mirror into a regular mirror. And she knew I was on her side, and I admired her enormously. And she was torturing herself. She couldn't help doing that.\"",
      "The documentary, for the first time, shows the public the full extent of President Nixon's feud with Graham. A White House recording features one of the president's conversations with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover:",
      "Hoover: \"I saw her on TV last night, Mrs. Graham. I would've thought she's about 85 years old. She's only about, I think, something like 57.\"Nixon: \"Oh, no, I know that.\"Hoover: \"She's aged terribly.\"Nixon: \"She's a terrible old bag.\"Hoover: \"Oh, she's an old bitch, in my estimation.\"Nixon: \"That's right!\"",
      "But according to Buffett, \"Nixon didn't scare her at all.\" What did scare her was the idea of losing the paper. Never did that feel more real to Graham than in 1975, when the Post's printers damaged the presses and went on a bitter strike for more than four months, limiting the paper's circulation.",
      "\"How challenging was that time?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, it tore her apart,\" said Buffett. \"She was suffering in that way at that time more than she ever suffered during Watergate, or during the Pentagon Papers, or anything. But she thought she might be blowing everything.\"",
      "Buffett told us Katharine Graham prevailed because she was brave \u2026 and it's because of her that the Washington Post Company stock price went up more than 3,000 percent while she was publisher.",

      "\"Yeah, but she didn't convert me!\" laughed Buffett, who said his favorite foods were what he was eating when he was six years old: \"Hot dogs and hamburgers and Coke and ice cream sundaes, and root beer floats are my favorite. I frequently have a dinner with a root beer float.\"",
      "Once, attending a dinner at Graham's, prepared by a French chef, Buffett was served a lobster: \"Well, I unfortunately attacked it from the wrong side,\" he said. \"Of course, she was very reluctant to criticize me. Finally at some point she said, 'You know, it might be helpful \u2026'\u00a0 What did I know about lobsters?\"",

      "As for the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" the legendary investor is now 94 years old, still chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and still making front page news. Every word he utters has the power to roil the financial markets.",
      "When asked about the state of the economy today, Buffett demurred: \"Well, I think that's the most interesting subject in the world, but I won't talk, I can't talk about it, though. I really can't.\"",
      "Asked about how tariffs will affect the economy, Buffett stated, \"Tariffs are actually, we've had a lot of experience with them. They're an act of war, to some degree.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you think tariffs will impact inflation?\"",
      "\"Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay 'em!\" he laughed. \"And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'\"",
      "Despite deflecting questions about the current news from Washington, or of Trump adviser Elon Musk's efforts to cut the government, Buffett did admit that he is bullish on American companies. \"A majority of any money I manage will always be in the United States,\" he said.",
      "And why is that? \"It's the best place!\" he laughed. \"I was lucky to be born here.\"",

    "summary": "Ukraine also brings divisions; Trump's immigration efforts rate well, but many look for more inflation focus.",
    "story": [
      "There's at least one thing Americans widely agree on about President Donald Trump: they think he's changing the way the government works.",
      "But they're more split on whether that's for the better or worse.",
      "His approach to immigration and deportation continues to receive positive marks, and his border policies are seen as effective. A large majority agree there is some waste in the federal government.",
      "DOGE and Elon Musk's efforts divide the nation, though, as Americans foresee an impact from dismissing federal workers. Half the country thinks this will cut their services and remove essential people. Half think it'll save money.",
      "Either way, it isn't the main issue they want Mr. Trump focused on. They overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy, and far fewer think he actually is.",
      "The people who think Mr. Trump is changing the government for the better \u2014 who include a lot of Republicans and people who voted for him \u2014 overwhelmingly approve of things like his policies on deportation and his efforts to reduce the federal workforce. They would specifically give Elon Musk and DOGE a lot of influence.",
      "Those who see major changes for the worse \u2014 most Democrats and those who didn't back him \u2014 go the other way on all of this. Most of them don't think Musk and DOGE ought to have any influence. They see reductions in the workforce as eliminating essential workers and as having the effect of consolidating Mr. Trump's power.",
      "Most Americans see a wide range of potential impacts from the federal workforce reductions.",
      "For most Republicans, these reductions will lead to efficiencies and savings.",
      "For Democrats, it'll remove essential workers, and they also see political impacts: removing workers who don't support him and conferring more power on Mr. Trump.",
      "The public is on balance wary of Musk and DOGE's access to government agency data records. Democrats and independents think he has too much access, but Republicans either say he has the right amount or would give him more.",
      "That said, most do think there is at least some waste in the federal government, and that view crosses party lines. But they differ on how much and what causes it: Republicans think there is a lot, mostly caused by fraud in the system, while Democrats think there is only some, mostly caused by poor spending decisions.",
      "Is Trump prioritizing what people want?",
      "Mr. Trump gets narrowly positive ratings for handling the economy, but not inflation specifically.",
      "There's a big difference between what Americans think Mr. Trump ought to give high priority and what they think he is prioritizing.",
      "They overwhelmingly want Mr. Trump focused on the economy and inflation. That cuts across partisan lines. (Perhaps no surprise there, as they've been among Americans' top issues for years.)",
      "The percent who think he is giving a lot of priority to the economy and inflation, though, is far lower.",
      "Most think he is prioritizing the border, the federal workforce and tariffs, more so than inflation. And his policies aren't seen as driving down food and grocery prices.",
      "The focus on the border does help him politically: he gets approval on his handling of immigration, and most continue to back his deportation policy. Most say his policies are reducing the number of migrants crossing the border.",
      "That all leaves Mr. Trump's approval rating in positive territory, but more closely divided than a couple of weeks ago.",
      "In all, Republicans now overwhelmingly think things in the country are going at least somewhat well, which has driven up the overall percentage of Americans who are saying that since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Changes in international relations",
      "Americans also think there are major changes happening with U.S. international relations. And again here, a split on whether that is better or worse.",
      "Interviewing for the poll was almost entirely conducted prior to the Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Americans overall want to remain engaged on the world stage. Though few think the U.S. should take the leading role in the world, most do think it should work alongside its allies.",
      "And most see the nations of Western Europe collectively (Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy) as allies of the U.S.",
      "Half of Americans say they back Ukraine in the conflict with Russia, almost half are neutral.",
      "In interviews largely conducted prior to the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, few Americans thought Mr. Trump favored Ukraine in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.",
      "Those who personally support Ukraine overwhelmingly say Mr. Trump favored Russia, while those who don't pick a side overwhelmingly say he's treated them equally.",
      "His handling of the conflict is largely split along party lines.",
      "Most Americans do continue to see Russia as unfriendly or an enemy. Republicans are comparably less inclined to see it as an enemy than are Americans overall.",

      "A HIT-AND-RUN OR A PLANNED ATTACK?",
      "Whatever had transpired at this deserted crossroads, Durkin's job was to freeze it in time. First responders had thought Davis McClendon's injuries seemed consistent with having been hit by a vehicle, though no other vehicle relating to the collision was there. They'd found McClendon's body about 50 feet away from the BMW, leading them to suspect he'd been outside his car when he was hit.",
      "Patrick Durkin: There was no rain or anything that would potentially wash anything away. So, um, the main thing I focused on \u2026 was the vehicle.",

      "Patrick Durkin: \u2014 it would just kinda be pressed into it. And this was torn back, like a tuna can in a sense.",
      "It had made authorities wonder if it was a hit-and-run or something more sinister. The airbags were out, and a phone was on the front passenger seat. Durkin saw more debris in the road, but nothing particularly telling.",
      "Ronny Powell: The assumption was that he was struck by a vehicle.",
      "Investigator Ronny Powell from the Greenwood County Sheriff's Office says authorities had learned more by speaking to two women at the scene: Meredith Haynie and Megan McGovern, who'd called 911. McGovern often babysat for Haynie's three children.",
      "Ronny Powell: They \u2026 provided statements of what they saw and what had occurred \u2026 all night long.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: What did Meredith say?",
      "Ronny Powell: She pretty much gave a summary of the whole backstory \u2026 that she had been dating Davis.",
      "Haynie had told the authorities that McClendon left a club they'd been in that night, calling her minutes later from the road, saying he was parked at the intersection of Avid Road and Sawgrass Place. When he'd put her on hold and then failed to come back on the line, Haynie was worried and got a ride there from McGovern. It was McGovern, the babysitter, who'd gotten out of her car and was the first to see McClendon's body.",

      "Meredith Haynie: He was the most empathetic person I've ever met.",
      "More than four months before McClendon died, on the night of Dec. 23, 2022, Haynie was at that club, celebrating her 39th birthday with her best friends. She says they were wearing their worst Christmas sweaters when the handsome stranger struck up a conversation.",
      "Meredith Haynie: \u00a0Then I think he texted on Christmas Day and then the next day, and then the next.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: And you just kept on talking.",
      "Meredith Haynie: Mm-hmm.",
      "Until meeting McClendon, she says she'd been keeping her head down. Just about six months earlier, Haynie had left her husband of 10 years \u2014 a local auto body shop owner named Bud Ackerman \u2014 and she was struggling to balance parenting their three kids and her job as a grammar school teacher. She says she knew getting involved with someone new would not be easy.",

      "Anne-Marie Green: And what did that tell you when you saw it?",
      "Patrick Durkin: Well, we knew that there was, some type of impact to the vehicle. And then we knew there was, uh, oil and \u2014 and tire marks that left from here.",
      "It looked like evidence from the vehicle that hit Davis.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: You guys are looking around and you realize the oil continues \u2026",
      "Patrick Durkin: You could see \u2026 it was very obvious that there was tire marks that \u2026 had had gone back down the road and kinda turned around \u2026",
      "Back where the tire tracks seemed to show a vehicle had turned around, investigators had found oil spatters about a foot up on a streetlight post.",
      "And from there, there was a trail of oil that had led down the road into the distance.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: It's breadcrumbs, basically.",
      "Patrick Durkin: In a manner of speaking.",

      "INVESTIGATORS FOLLOW THE OIL TRAIL AND A HUNCH",
      "Investigator Ronny Powell says by the time authorities started following that oil trail from the crash site, they had a solid hunch where it might lead. Davis McClendon's girlfriend Meredith Haynie had told them she'd suspected where he had been going when he left her at the bar that night: to meet her estranged husband Bud Ackerman.",

      "Looking at the scene, they deduced McClendon had been standing outside his BMW, as shown in this CBS News animation based on their investigation. They suspect Ackerman's pickup truck sideswiped the sedan and hit McClendon, carrying him on the vehicle's grille and depositing his body across the road.",

      "Meredith Haynie: When I was done, I was done.",
      "And starting again with someone new seemed like a distant dream, Haynie says, until that night Davis McClendon sauntered up and sat down in her life. They'd tried to keep things low-key at first. Haynie says she never wanted to rub Ackerman's nose in it.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: So what did you all do?",
      "Meredith Haynie: We would go out of town.",
      "But Haynie says they knew they couldn't sneak around forever and it had started seeming like her new relationship with Davis was a forever kind of thing.",

      "Meredith Haynie: I think \u2026 he agreed, but then we talked about it and decided that was just giving him another little piece of control.",
      "And on the night McClendon died, she says Ackerman seemed out of control. Back at his parents' house, investigators now had a warrant and were finding more clues that Ackerman had been at the crash site.",

      "Anne Marie Green: What's left to do?",
      "Ronny Powell: Well, that's just the beginning \u2026",
      "Because it turns out Ackerman did have a story to tell. He says McClendon was standing near the middle of a dark road. Ackerman says he didn't see McClendon until it was too late and that hitting him had been an accident. And Ackerman's team says they can prove it.",

      "\"These conditions exist not as an act of God, but rather as an act of our political leaders, or more precisely, the lack of intelligent action by many of our political leaders,\" Cuomo said.",
      "He reminded voters of his long history of public service that started when he worked for his father,\u00a0former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and included serving as attorney general.",

      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, in a legal battle over the president's authority to oust the head of the independent agency that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired, even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \"only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic president Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Jackson rejected the Trump administration's claims that the special counsel's removal protections are unconstitutional because they prevent the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "The judge said allowing the president to remove the special counsel at will would have a chilling effect on his crucial duties, which include guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing.",
      "\"The Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing \u2014 by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,\" Jackson wrote in her decision.",
      "The Justice Department quickly filed court papers indicating it will challenge the ruling to Washington's federal appeals court. The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.",
      "The ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.",
      "\"I'm glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\"",
      "The judge said the special counsel has a \"unique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "\"If I don't have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\" Dellinger told reporters outside Washington's federal courthouse after a recent hearing.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger's firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.",
      "The Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \"a constitutional red line\" by blocking Dellinger's firing and stopping Trump \"from shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration's critical first days.\"",
      "Dellinger was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in February 2024.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's advisers on Saturday morning were still uncertain how to salvage a mining deal with Ukraine, which had been intended as a key first step in a Trump strategy to eventually secure a ceasefire and peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "What began as a formal meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Friday \u2014 a confidence-building step in a path toward peace between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 devolved into a feud, with finger-pointing and accusations.",
      "The president's closest advisers \u2014 stunned after the debacle in the Oval Office \u2014 huddled around the Cabinet Room's oblong table for lunch, sources familiar with the events told CBS News.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were joined by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as the group rehashed what had just transpired.",
      "They shared disbelief over what one source characterized as Zelenskyy badgering the president. Another official said that, had Zelenskyy kept his disagreements behind closed doors, the blowup wouldn't have happened.",
      "During the contentious meeting, Mr. Trump and Vance took an aggressive and sometimes belittling tone with Zelenskyy after he expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement given that he had repeatedly violated ceasefire deals, including the Minsk agreements, leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In the hours after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House at the behest of Rubio and Waltz \u2014 with a joint press conference scrapped \u2014 there was discussion about whether the Ukrainian leader should fire whoever may have advised him on Friday's strategy. CBS News has reached out to Ukrainian officials for comment.",
      "Some of the Trump team's frustration targeted Zelenskyy's chief adviser, Andriy Yermak, whom they believed had undermined negotiations in recent days. Others said they weren't so sure it was an adviser problem.",
      "It wasn't the first time Zelenskyy had clashed with his American counterpart. President Biden once hung up on Zelenskyy because of the Ukrainian president's perceived combativeness, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. The friction was kept private and officials insist the dispute was over policy \u2014 not basic facts like which country had started the war.",
      "In recent days, there were signs the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal might not come to fruition. Neither side had signed preliminary paperwork that typically precedes an economic agreement of this scale.",
      "On Friday morning, Graham, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, and others met privately with Zelenskyy at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. They recommended that Zelenskyy avoid being contentious, say thank you and sign the deal without changes, according to people in the room.",
      "Some Trump advisers were nervous the deal might go south before the ceremonial signing, but felt confident by the time Mr. Trump greeted Zelenskyy. They viewed it as an economic security guarantee, a shared investment binding the U.S. and Ukraine for a generation, sources said.",
      "Zelenskyy had appealed to the West for ceasefire and post-war security guarantees, which were not explicitly included in the minerals deal. In Kyiv last month, Treasury Secretary Bessent had described the agreement as the foundation for a larger peace deal, and an economic partnership that would provide once the conflict is over a 'long term security shield for all Ukrainians.' However, the deal itself was not a ceasefire or peace agreement. Bessent described it as a very strong signal to Russian leadership of American commitment.",
      "Kyiv had hoped for security guarantees up front that would secure a pledge by the U.S. to help keep the long term peace and prevent Russia from invading again.",
      "The White House expected to finalize a version of the deal Friday that was essentially the same as one Bessent presented to Kyiv in mid-February. One modification: a provision was removed that would have placed a $500 billion cap on the value of minerals Ukraine would provide. The change was made at Ukraine's request because Zelenskyy disliked the narrative that Ukraine owed a certain repayment for past aid, people familiar with the deal said.",
      "\"We were trying to make it reasonable for them,\" one Trump adviser said. Trump's team privately discussed how they liked the new version better because it meant a deal could be worth more than initially conceived.",
      "The minerals deal was a concept Graham had circulated as an avenue to create a new, mutually beneficial relationship for the two countries. Zelenskyy had presented it to Mr. Trump, at Graham's urging, at a meeting at Trump Tower in September.",
      "But on Friday, staff quietly removed the formal ceremonial set-up from the East Room \u2014 a conference table and two podiums, and two sets of binders with unsigned documents.",
      "Zelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London to meet with sympathetic European allies. No plans had been made for Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to speak again.",
      "In the meantime, America remains the most significant military and financial backer of Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. There is $3.85 billion in military equipment already designated for delivery to Ukraine, and it is not clear if Mr. Trump will still clear it for delivery.",
      "\"They are fortunate it's not off already,\" a senior U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "As for any further pledges of U.S. support from the Republican-led Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson recently said there's no appetite for it.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's government said early Sunday it supports a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza through Ramadan and Passover, though Hamas has insisted on negotiating the truce's second phase instead.",
      "The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office came minutes after the first phase ended, and as talks have begun on starting the second phase that's aimed at ending the war and seeing all remaining living hostages in Gaza returned home.",
      "The statement gives new details on what Israel described as a U.S. proposal: A ceasefire extension through Passover, or April 20. On the first day of the framework, half the hostages, alive and dead, would be released. The rest would be released if an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The statement said it was proposed after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff got \"the impression that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\"",
      "There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which earlier rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire's first phase by 42 days \u2014 doubling its length \u2014 saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "Officials from Israel and mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on starting the ceasefire's second phase in Cairo. But Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, told The Associated Press there had been \"no progress\" before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday. Hamas did not attend, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal's terms, fighting should not resume while negotiations are underway on phase two.",
      "Israel's new statement says it can return to fighting \"if it believes that the negotiations are ineffective,\" and it noted Hamas' refusal to accept the proposal for an extension of the first phase.",
      "However, \"if Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately enter into negotiations on all the details of the Witkoff plan,\" the statement says.",
      "Before Israel's new statement, an Egyptian official involved in the talks spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. The official said Hamas, Qatar and Egypt wanted to continue with the existing ceasefire deal, and they rejected Israel's proposal to extend the ceasefire for four weeks with a release of hostages every Saturday without officially entering negotiations on the second phase.",
      "The Egyptian official said the U.S. wants to start negotiations on the second phase but called for hostage releases during the negotiations. Hamas insisted on a full implementation of the ceasefire terms.",
      "The first phase, which paused 15 months of fighting in Gaza, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of people returned home to northern Gaza, aid into the territory increased and Israeli forces withdrew to buffer zones.",
      "Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that left about 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. Since then, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say more than half the dead have been women and children.",
      "According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead.",
      "The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January. Talks on the second phase were meant to start the first week of February. Israelis rallied Saturday night to urge their government to continue the deal.",
      "Hamas has reaffirmed its \"full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details\" and called on the international community to pressure Israel to immediately proceed to the second phase.",
      "Other challenges complicate the ceasefire's future. Israel has said Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah.",
      "Hamas leader Mohamed Darwish on Saturday reiterated the group is willing to hand over power to a Palestinian national consensus government or an Egypt-proposed body of technocrats not aligned with Hamas or Fatah. His comments came in an open letter to next week's summit of Arab leaders in Cairo. Hamas has dismissed Israel's suggestion that its leadership go into exile.",
      "Witkoff, speaking on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" last weekend, said that securing the release of the last U.S. national believed to be among the surviving hostages,\u00a0Edan Alexander\u00a0was \"front and center for us.\" Alexander was serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was abducted during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack,",
      "\"I know his parents,\" Witkoff told CBS News. \"We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home, and we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe.\"",

      "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander closed in on the moon Saturday, on course for a nail-biting automated descent to touchdown early Sunday, the first of three private-sector robotic moon landers to reach its target after launches earlier this year.",
      "The Blue Ghost lunar lander spent a month orbiting Earth after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in January, giving Firefly flight controllers in Austin, Texas, plenty of time to activate and test its systems and science payloads before heading to the moon.",
      "Once there, the spacecraft spent 16 days in lunar orbit refining its trajectory and beaming back spectacular views of Earth from 240,000 miles away.",
      "Now, after multiple thruster firings to reach the planned descent orbit, the 6.6-foot-tall spacecraft is poised for a rocket-powered drop to the surface. Touchdown at Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 is expected around 3:34 a.m. EST, near an ancient volcanic feature called Mons Latreille.",
      "The solar-powered lander is expected to operate for a full lunar \"day,\" or 14 Earth days. If all goes well, it may continue operating on battery power for a few hours into the dark lunar night before finally going silent.",
      "Firefly CEO Jason Kim said the Blue Ghost is the latest example of commercial technology provided by the private sector \"really bringing down the cost and affordability of (space) systems.\"",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" he said in a pre-launch interview with CBS News.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "NASA paid Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored  science instruments, built at a cost of $44 million, to the moon as  part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)  initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private  industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science  and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the  surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent another lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "For ispace's second attempt, the appropriately-named Resilience took a long, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to make its landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6.",

      "Woosley, who grew up in New England, now lives in Baker, a town of 100 people. Alongside 20 of Baker's 100 residents, Woosley hopes to get dark skies designation for the area to lessen the light pollution from the street, house, business lights and other lighting sources.",
      "There are very few places left in the country where there is so little artificial light that the Milky Way is visible to the naked eye. Nevada is one such place, and to preserve that Woosley is part of a larger group of determined state residents dreaming up novel ways to raise funds to stop their dark skies from disappearing, including promoting \"astro-tourism,\" drives across large swathes of rural land in the dark of night \u2014 and even selling license plates.",
      "And after recent federal cuts in National Parks \u00a0\u2014 about 3,400 recently-hired employees with the U.S. Forest Service and 1,000 employees with the National Park Service were fired from their jobs last weekend under the Trump administration, accounting for 10% and 5% of those workforces, respectively \u2014 the stakes might be higher than ever.",
      "Most Americans live under light pollution",
      "These Nevada residents plan to save dark skies within their state borders \u2014 but also hope to inspire Americans across the nation to protect them. There are several dark sky areas in the United States,\u00a0the National Park Service says, including in Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Idaho.",
      "In 2019, Dark Sky International designated the first dark sky sanctuary on public land \u2014 as Nevada's Massacre Rim. (About 63% of Nevada's land is public.) Critics will say there are only about six truly dark areas, according to NASA maps, and other areas have light pollution.",
      "This matters, proponents say, because more than 80% of the world's population, and 99% of Americans and Europeans, live under sky glow - which causes big problems for humans, wildlife, and the environment. The natural circadian rhythms of humans and animals are disrupted by light pollution and have caused the decline of fireflies, the death of birds during migrations, and sea turtle confusion.",
      "In the U.S., about 19 states have laws limiting light pollution, and Texas has laws governing lights around military bases \u2014 but most areas have limited requirements. Dark Sky International says there are about 230 places around the world showing \"strong support\" for dark skies, and they created an interactive map for users to see if they live in a place impacted by light pollution.",
      "To ease the funding crunch needed to get dark skies designation \u2014 which was challenging before the latest federal cuts \u2014 local organization\u00a0Friends of Nevada Wilderness\u00a0started developing the idea for a \"Save Starry Skies\" license plate back in 2018. Program manager Pam duPre said it took years to get approval from the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles. The plates, designed by dark sky advocate Jonathan Boarini, were released in May 2024 for $61 - with $25 going to the Friends of Nevada Wilderness.",
      "About 2,000 plates have been sold and \"we expect that number to keep climbing,\" duPre told CBS News.",
      "Executive Director Shaaron Netherton said the funds will help rural communities get a dark sky designation, like Baker and Gerlach, a small town 100 miles north of Reno and the gateway to the annual festival \"Burning Man.\" Funding will also be used to promote astro-tourism, supporting local efforts to upgrade lighting and infrastructure to attract stargazers.",
      "Dark sky \"astro-tourism\"",
      "Dave Cooper, a long-time resident of Gerlach and defender of rural tourism and dark skies, like Woosley, has been working to promote \"astro-tourism\" in their area. Cooper, who retired from the Bureau of Land Management, has been living in rural Nevada for 24 years. The dark skies area in Nevada is \"the largest one on the lowest 48,\" and Cooper is working to develop dark sky tourism and \"astro-tourism\" in his area.",
      "Gerlach is an unincorporated community, so it is challenging to get all the lighting shields in place and infrastructure needed to keep the skies dark, Cooper says.",
      "Both Cooper and Woosley feel once visitors come to experience the majestic nature of truly dark skies, things will change for the better.",
      "\"People don't see dark skies as a resource,\" said Woosley, adding that dark skies haven't gotten the same attention as parks or beaches.",
      "Woosley said she didn't truly understand the depth of dark skies until she came out West. She was a teacher in Washington D.C. married to a national park ranger for three decades when they moved out to Great Basin National Park in 2018.",

      "A U.S. aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea on Sunday in a show of force, days after North Korea test-launched\u00a0cruise missiles to demonstrate its counterattack capabilities.",
      "The arrival of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group at the South Korean port of Busan was meant to display a solid U.S.-South Korean military alliance in the face of persistent\u00a0North Korean threats, and boost interoperability of the allies' combined assets, the South Korean navy said in a statement.",
      "It said it was the first U.S. aircraft carrier to travel to South Korea since June.",
      "The deployment of the carrier is expected to infuriate North Korea, which views temporary deployments of such powerful U.S. military assets as major security threats. North Korea has responded to some of the past deployments of U.S. aircraft carriers, long-range bombers and nuclear-powered submarines with missile tests.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again to revive diplomacy. North Korea hasn't directly responded to Trump's overture but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since Trump's inauguration.",
      "North Korea said Friday it test-fired strategic cruise missiles earlier last week to inform its adversaries of its military's counterattack capability and the readiness of its nuclear operations. After watching the launches, the North's fourth missile testing event this year, Kim said the military must be fully ready to use its nuclear weapons",
      "Experts say Kim won't likely accept Trump's overture anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia's war against Ukraine with provision of weapons and troops. They say Kim could consider resuming diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country's current booming cooperation with Russia",
      "Kim and Trump\u00a0met three times from 2018-19 during Trump's first term to discuss the future of North Korea's nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.",

On the first day of the framework, half the hostages, alive and dead, would be released. The rest would be released if an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire.",

Hundreds of thousands of people returned home to northern Gaza, aid into the territory increased and Israeli forces withdrew to buffer zones.",
      "Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that left about 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. Since then, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say more than half the dead have been women and children.",

      "\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.",
      "Zelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.",
      "Vance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.",
      "\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.",
      "Zelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"",
      "\"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"",
      "\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"",
      "\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.",
      "Zelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.",
      "\"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\"",
      "Mr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.",
      "\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.",
      "\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.",
      "Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire?",
      "\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"",
      "Earlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.",
      "\"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.",
      "\"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\"",
      "The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"",
      "\"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m.",
      "After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0@POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.",
      "As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.",
      "\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\"",
      "Administration sources on next steps",
      "High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.",
      "When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.",
      "No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "Zelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported.",
      "Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.",
      "The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.",
      "What to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit",
      "Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.",
      "In a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.",
      "\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\"\u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.",
      "\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.",
      "\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.",
      "Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.",
      "Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"",
      "The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.",
      "\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"",
      "But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.",
      "\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.",
      "\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost lunar lander privately developed by Firefly Aerospace is carrying a suite of sophisticated instruments to the moon for NASA.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander closed in on the moon Saturday, on course for a nail-biting automated descent to touchdown early Sunday, the first of three private-sector robotic moon landers to reach its target after launches earlier this year.",
      "The Blue Ghost lunar lander spent a month orbiting Earth after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in January, giving Firefly flight controllers in Austin, Texas, plenty of time to activate and test its systems and science payloads before heading to the moon.",
      "Once there, the spacecraft spent 16 days in lunar orbit refining its trajectory and beaming back spectacular views of Earth from 240,000 miles away.",
      "Now, after multiple thruster firings to reach the planned descent orbit, the 6.6-foot-tall spacecraft is poised for a rocket-powered drop to the surface. Touchdown at Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 is expected around 3:34 a.m. EST, near an ancient volcanic feature called Mons Latreille.",
      "The solar-powered lander is expected to operate for a full lunar \"day,\" or 14 Earth days. If all goes well, it may continue operating on battery power for a few hours into the dark lunar night before finally going silent.",
      "Firefly CEO Jason Kim said the Blue Ghost is the latest example of commercial technology provided by the private sector \"really bringing down the cost and affordability of (space) systems.\"",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" he said in a pre-launch interview with CBS News.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "NASA paid Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored  science instruments, built at a cost of $44 million, to the moon as  part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)  initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private  industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science  and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the  surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent another lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "For ispace's second attempt, the appropriately-named Resilience took a long, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to make its landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Firefly's lander is carrying 10 instruments, including cameras, a drill to bore into the surface below the spacecraft, a radiation-tolerant computer, equipment that will attempt to pull in GPS navigation signals from Earth, an experiment to learn more about managing lunar dust and one to monitor the dispersal of dust kicked up by the lander's rocket engines.",
      "\"One of the core purposes of the CLPS program with NASA is to be a precursor to Artemis, which is obviously sending humans back to the moon,\" said Ray Allensworth, Firefly's spacecraft program director.",
      "\"So our payloads are collecting data so we can figure out what does it feel like to be on the lunar surface, to operate on the lunar surface? So all that data will inform when we actually return humans to the moon.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kurdish militants who have waged a 40-year insurgency in Turkey declared a ceasefire on Saturday in what could mark a significant boost to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, two days after their imprisoned leader called for the group to disarm.",
      "The announcement by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, comes against the backdrop of fundamental changes in the region, including the reconfiguration of power in neighboring Syria after the toppling of President Bashar Assad, the weakening of the Hezbollah militant movement in Lebanon and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "The conflict between Turkey and the PKK has led to tens of thousands of deaths since it began in 1984. The ceasefire is the first sign of a breakthrough since peace talks between the PKK and Ankara broke down in the summer of 2015.",
      "The PKK declaration was published by the Firat News Agency, a media outlet close to the group, on Saturday. It referred to the insurgents' leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned by Turkey since 1999.",
      "\"We declare a ceasefire effective today to pave the way for the implementation of Leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society. None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,\" it said, referring to Ocalan by his nickname.",
      "On Thursday, a delegation of Kurdish politicians announced Ocalan's call for the PKK to lay down its arms and disband after visiting him on his island prison.",
      "The White House praised the call for peace, CBS News reported earlier this week.",
      "In its statement, the PKK's executive committee said Ocalan's call indicated that a \"new historical process has begun in Kurdistan and the Middle East.\" Kurdistan refers to the parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran inhabited by Kurds.",
      "While stating that it would \"comply with and implement the requirements of the call from our own side,\" the PKK emphasized that \"democratic politics and legal grounds must also be suitable for success.\"",
      "Ocalan's call came as the main pro-Kurdish political party in Turkey has faced pressure, with several of its mayors being removed from office in recent months and replaced by government appointees.",
      "The PKK also appealed for Ocalan to be released from Imrali prison, located in the Marmara Sea, to \"personally direct and execute\" a party congress that would lead to the militants laying down their arms.",
      "The peace initiative between the Turkish state and the PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies, was started in October by Erdogan's coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, a far-right politician who suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.",
      "Berkay Mandiraci, senior Turkey analyst with the\u00a0International Crisis Group\u00a0think tank, told CBS News a peace deal between the Turkish government and the PKK could \"remove this long-standing thorn in bilateral ties,\" and it could bring with it \"a host of dividends for Turkey.\"",
      "Erdogan said Ocalan's message was a \"new phase\" in peace efforts in Turkey.",
      "\"There is an opportunity to take a historic step toward tearing down the wall of terror that has stood between (Turkish and Kurdish peoples') 1,000-year-old brotherhood,\" Erdogan said on Friday.",
      "The government's first response to the ceasefire came from Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz. \"A new phase has been entered towards the goal of a terror-free Turkey. \u2026 We hope that this opportunity will be seized, this effort will be concluded quickly and successfully,\" he posted on X.",
      "Some believe the main aim of the reconciliation effort is for Erdogan's government to garner Kurdish support for a new constitution that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his term ends.",
      "Bahceli has openly called for a new constitution, saying it was essential for Turkey's future that Erdogan remain in power. Erdogan and Bahceli are reportedly seeking parliamentary support from the pro-Kurdish People's Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM.",
      "\"There will be a series of meetings next week, including state officials and politicians, and many things will become clearer and more concrete. We hope that everything will be arranged in the next three months,\" said Sirri Sureyya Onder, one of the DEM members who visited Ocalan in prison on Thursday.",
      "The leader of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said Ocalan's call for a ceasefire does not apply to his group in Syria.",
      "Ocalan, 75, wields significant influence in the Kurdish movement despite his 25-year imprisonment, during which the PKK has been led by top figures who have fled and found sanctuary in the Kurdish region in northern Iraq.",
      "But a decade of fighting seems to have \"weakened\" the PKK, Mandiraci said. \"The Turkish military drove the group out of Turkey's southeast and pressed it deep into the steep and unforgiving mountains of northern Iraq,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the PKK has been limited to isolated attacks inside Turkey as the Turkish military, backed by armed drones, has pushed PKK insurgents increasingly across the mountainous border into Iraq.",
      "The leader of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said Ocalan's call for a ceasefire does not apply to his group in Syria.",

      "While Salem's contract has remained active, except for most of Wednesday, she said the hollowing out of USAID \u2014 with nearly all of its staff suddenly placed on leave or outright fired \u2014 has caused growing disarray. Most pressing, she said, is that the USAID-operated payment system she relies on \"has been down for weeks.\"",
      "That's created unparalleled uncertainty that is spreading from her business of 150 employees to her American suppliers \u2014 farmers across 25 states \u2014 and the U.S. ocean liners she uses to ship hundreds of metric tons of Edesia's Plumpy'Nut therapeutic paste, and finally, to the international organizations that distribute it to children staving off death.",
      "\"Everybody who is caught up in this time of chaos with massive uncertainty is worried. Everybody is,\" Salem said.",
      "Plumpy'Nut is classified as a ready-to-use therapeutic food, prescribed for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children as young as six months old. It's a peanut-based paste that includes vitamins, minerals and milk powder, in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Edesia says it produces 800 metric tons of Plumpy'Nut and other foods used to treat malnutrition every week.",
      "Salem believes ultimately that her company's goal of protecting children aligns with Trump administration priorities. \"We have a strong belief that our mission will be protected, that these funds will be there, but I can't promise that to anyone.\"",
      "Salem said she agrees that USAID could be operated more efficiently, and she has ideas from years of work with the agency. She faces the same dilemma, whether she wants to propose solutions or simply try to process payments.",
      "\"Who should I call?\" She asked. \"I have been offering suggestions for years, and now is the time for someone to listen, if I can just find someone who will pick up the phone.\"",
      "A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that it had ended more than 90% of its USAID contracts, retaining only those that it believes make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. The agency's cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to drastically shrink the federal workforce and budget.",
      "Each packet of Plumpy'Nut produced by Edesia is printed with the phrase \"from the American people\" printed on it. Salem said the message to the desperate parents and caretakers of malnourished children is an important part of her company's mission.",
      "\"They will never, ever forget that it was the American people who were there for them in their biggest time of crisis,\" Salem said.",
      "She and others who run organizations associated with USAID told CBS News another global superpower is poised to step in if the United States retreats from corners of the world where it provides support for crucial medical care: China.",
      "\"This is an incredibly strong use of soft power to deliver a food, a specialized food to people in their biggest time of need,\" Salem said.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 20:34:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Ukrainian officials reached out to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track, but President Trump was unwilling to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy further today, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. military aid to Ukraine could be in jeopardy after a contentious Oval Office meeting Friday between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to administration officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "The day started on a positive note, with Mr. Trump joking with Zelenskyy, a guest book signing and warm conversation in the Oval Office.",
      "But the episode has raised questions about whether Zelenskyy can move forward toward a peace deal, and whether the U.S. will or should pause aid to Ukraine.",
      "Though several of the president's allies have called on Zelenskyy to step down or \"change,\" Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, according to the officials, who said there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than its current president.",
      "Multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy left the White House Friday afternoon to ask how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "No phone calls between Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the officials said.",
      "Still, the administration believes that the Ukrainian leader has put his country in a terrible position and that he missed out on a huge opportunity to have the U.S. as a business partner, with U.S. companies working on helping Ukraine monetize their mineral resources, such as gas and oil, aluminum and tritium and others.",
      "The minerals deal was set to be signed with much pomp and circumstance, and it was the first step in what Mr. Trump foresaw as a progression towards peace. According to the officials, Mr. Trump fully intended to sign the minerals deal. Two official binders were prepared and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Ukrainian counterpart, Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump were going to sit at a conference table in the East Room to trumpet the success.",
      "But there were suspicions before Zelenskyy arrived on Friday that it might fall apart. The Trump administration had been pushing for weeks for a minerals deal signing at the ministerial level, but Ukraine refused. Zelenskyy wanted security guarantees in exchange.",
      "And following the Oval Office meeting, Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track, but Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the officials said.",
      "When Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mr. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz went to the Roosevelt Room, where Zelenskyy and his team were holding after the Oval Office meeting, Rubio made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counter-productive, the officials said. Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake and had done a disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.",
      "U.S. officials thought negotiations would be much harder with Russian President Vladimir Putin and have been in disbelief that it has been Zelenskyy who has been difficult, the sources said. Trump officials were concerned the Russians would come with all-or-nothing demands during a recent meeting in Riyadh, but they didn't. The negotiators had reasonable requests for Rubio and Waltz, but instead it has been Ukraine that has had maximalist demands, according to the Trump officials.",
      "The White House is now uncertain if they can get Russia and Ukraine to end the war that has dragged on for more than three years, the officials told CBS News.",
      "Asked how Zelenskyy can repair this, the Trump officials said the Ukrainian leader needs to explicitly say he wants a ceasefire, because it's now unclear to the administration that he would ever sign anything with Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader, speaking to Fox News' Bret Baier later Friday, rejected the notion that he wouldn't sign a peace agreement with Putin. He said, \"We will have negotiations,\" and reiterated that Ukraine must have security guarantees.",
      "\"We are ready for peace but we have to be in a strong position,\" Zelenskyy said. He also expressed confidence that the relationship with Mr. Trump can be salvaged.",
      "The U.S. has made it clear to Ukraine that Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership before talking about security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, if it happened, the officials disclosed. There have been no discussions among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, have all been talking to Mr. Trump and his team about troop presence in Ukraine and what the security guarantees would look like.",
      "Meanwhile, a defense official said there have been U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine since Jan. 20, but no new packages have been announced. What was in the pipeline committed by the Biden administration has been continuing. It sometimes takes months for certain items, like vehicles, to arrive in Ukraine.",
      "There is $3.85 billion left in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, according to two U.S. officials. This is spending authority, not appropriated money, which means that it is up to the White House, not Congress, to determine whether to release that or not. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere, it is just authority to give Ukraine weapons from U.S. stockpiles. It is up to Mr. Trump to decide whether to send Zelenskyy the remainder of that weaponry.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Rubio and could potentially be held or released. The State Department under the Trump administration has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",
      "Margaret Brennan and \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Pope Francis experienced a \"sudden worsening of the respiratory picture\" Friday, the Vatican said, when he had an \"isolated crisis of bronchospasm,\" which is when the muscles that line the airways in the lungs tighten.",
      "The episode caused the 88-year-old pope to inhale vomit, the Vatican said in a statement. Francis was treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation had a good response, the Vatican said.",
      "\"The Holy Father has always remained vigilant and oriented, collaborating in therapeutic maneuvers,\" the Vatican said. \"The prognosis therefore still remains reserved.\"",
      "Earlier Friday, Vatican sources indicated to CBS News that the pope's health had improved, saying he was not currently in critical condition after exactly two weeks in hospital for bronchitis that developed into pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "\"The clinical picture remains complex, the criticality has subsided for the moment, but I would respect the caution of the doctors as the prognosis remains guarded,\" the sources said. There was no indication of how much longer the pontiff might remain hospitalized.",
      "The Vatican has been providing brief updates on the pope's health twice daily, and he had been improving in recent days, but doctors said his condition remained critical until Friday.",
      "A CT chest scan\u00a0taken Tuesday evening\u00a0showed the \"normal evolution\" of an infection as it is being treated. Blood tests have confirmed an improvement, according to the Vatican's update. The slight kidney insufficiency detected a few days ago has receded, and Francis is continuing to receive respiratory physiotherapy.",
      "The bilateral pneumonia diagnosis given to the pope on February 18 would have been a worrying turn for any patient of his age, but it was of particular concern for the leader of the Catholic Church, who has long suffered from respiratory problems.",
      "The pope has always kept a very busy schedule, and he appeared breathless at some of his public events earlier in the month before being admitted to the hospital on February 14 for what was first\u00a0diagnosed as bronchitis.",
      "People have been gathering outside Rome's Gemelli hospital to show their support, with many leaving messages and notes near a statue of former Pope John Paul II.",
      "The Vatican has said Francis is thankful for the \"closeness he feels\" from his supporters, and that he asked for people to pray for him.",
      "This is the pope's fourth hospitalization since he took over leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in 2013. He underwent significant\u00a0abdominal surgery\u00a0in 2021 and then had another procedure in 2023 to repair scar tissue and an abdominal hernia. He had been hospitalized briefly for treatment for pneumonia\u00a0earlier that year.",
      "As a young man in his home country of Argentina, Francis had part of one lung removed following a pulmonary infection, which left him vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.",
      "The Vatican announced earlier this month that Francis wouldn't celebrate Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica this year, due to his ongoing recovery. The pope's ongoing hospitalization comes just ahead of the start of the annual Christian observance of Lent. The 40-day Lenten period begins on Ash Wednesday, which this year falls on March 5.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 08:28:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The PKK's decades-long Kurdish insurgency in Turkey has killed tens of thousands of people. Now its long-time leader says it's time to end the fight.",
    "story": [
      "Istanbul \u2014 In a historic move, imprisoned Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan called Thursday on members of the banned Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) to lay down their weapons to end a decades-long conflict with Turkey's government that has killed tens of thousands of people and complicated U.S. relations with the NATO ally.",
      "The PKK is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., along with the European Union, NATO and many other nations. Ocalan's call for disarmament, if acted on by the PKK, is likely to have far-reaching implications for the entire Middle East, including for millions of ethnic Kurds living in Syria, Iraq and Iran.",
      "\"I am making a call for the laying down of arms and I take on the historical responsibility for this call,\" Ocalan said in a letter read out by Kurdish politicians in Istanbul. \"All groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself.\"",
      "The PKK was established by Ocalan in 1978, initially seeking full independence and statehood for Turkey's large Kurdish minority, but later asking for autonomy. Since then, as many as 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of others displaced from their homes by the simmering conflict between the group and Turkish state forces. The PKK has carried out several major terrorist attacks in Turkey, killing scores of security forces but also civilians in Istanbul and Ankara.",
      "Ocalan was arrested in 1999 and is serving a life sentence in a prison in northwest Turkey, but he's still seen as the movement's ideological leader. The reading of his letter was broadcast on screens set up in majority Kurdish cities in the southeast of Turkey, where it was cheered by crowds hopeful for peace.",
      "\"There is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit and realization of a political system. Democratic consensus is the fundamental way,\" Ocalan said in his statement.",
      "There was no immediate statement from the PKK's leadership on Ocalan's letter, but his call to disarm had been anticipated, and in a statement published by the group on February 12, the PKK hailed the move and said it would begin, \"a process of change, transformation and restructuring.\"",
      "U.S. hopes announcement will \"bring peace to this troubled region\"",
      "As a NATO member, Turkey is a strategic ally of the U.S., and it has played a particularly vital role, given its location at the junction of Asia and the Middle East, in counterterrorism efforts and promoting Mideast stability.",
      "Close U.S. military cooperation with another Kurdish armed group based in neighboring Syria, the YPG, against ISIS during Syria's civil war, caused serious friction with Ankara. Turkey has long argued that the YPG is an extension of the PKK, and that American support for the Kurdish forces was therefor an indirect endorsement of and support for the PKK.",
      "The Trump administration welcomed Ocalan's call, with U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes telling CNN on Thursday that it was, \"a significant development and we hope that it will help assuage our Turkish allies about U.S. counter-ISIS partners in northeast Syria. We believe it will help bring peace to this troubled region.\"",
      "Berkay Mandiraci, senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank, told CBS News a peace deal between the Turkish government and the PKK could \"remove this long-standing thorn in bilateral ties,\" and it could bring with it \"a host of dividends for Turkey.\"",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also expressed support for Ocalan's disarmament call, with his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric telling reporters on Thursday that it was an \"important development\" that offered \"a glimmer of hope that could lead to a resolution of the long-standing conflict.\"",
      "Mandiraci told CBS News an agreement between Ankara and the PKK could also help bring stability to Syria.",
      "A new Syrian government, led by former Islamic extremist rebels who've disavowed militancy and publicly embraced secularism, is trying to assert itself and gain international support.",
      "Mandiraci said a peace deal with the PKK in Turkey could bolster ongoing talks between the Kurdish forces that were backed by the U.S. and Syria's interim government, aimed at integrating the Kurdish-controlled northeast region of Syria with the Syrian state.",
      "Why would the PKK disarm now?",
      "\"After a decade of intensive fighting, the PKK seems to be weakened,\" Mandiraci told CBS News, assessing the timing of Ocalan's call. \"The Turkish military drove the group out of Turkey's southeast and pressed it deep into the steep and unforgiving mountains of northern Iraq.\"",
      "So far, however, no information has been shared publicly regarding the details of any negotiations that led to Ocalan's call, nor how the process of disarming the group might actually work. The Turkish government has said nothing about what it might offer the PKK in exchange for disarmament.",
      "Ocalan's statement comes as the Turkish government faces accusations of a crackdown on dissent. Since local elections were held across the country in March 2024, more than 10 elected mayors have been removed from their posts and replaced by government appointees, mostly in Kurdish-majority cities.",
      "So far, Ocalan's call has drawn a muted response from Turkish officials. Efkan Ala, the deputy chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party, said the government was focused on the outcome, not the statement.",
      "\"The essence of the call is the laying down of arms and the dissolution of the terrorist organization,\" Ala said. \"We will look at the outcome. Of course, as Turkey, we will see whether this outcome will materialize.\"",
      "A similar attempt to end the fighting more than a decade ago failed, after a ceasefire that lasted two years collapsed in 2015, engulfing Turkish forces in a bloody conflict with the PKK.",

      "Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa's deaths as well as that of their dog could be the result of a tragic accident, according to forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden.",
      "A criminal investigation into the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa was launched Wednesday after New Mexico authorities found the 95-year-old actor, the 65-year-old classical pianist and one of their dogs dead in their Santa Fe home under circumstances deemed \"suspicious.\"",
      "Santa Fe Sheriff Department officials have said that there were no obvious signs of foul play and no external trauma was seen on either Hackman or Arakawa. After preliminary autopsies were completed, Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza confirmed that the couple tested negative for carbon monoxide and Oscar-winning actor likely died about nine days before the bodies were discovered.",
      "GENE HACKMAN, WIFE FOUND DEAD AT SANTA FE ESTATE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE PROPERTY",
      "During an appearance on \"Fox Report,\" Baden explained that Hackman's pacemaker, which the sheriff said last recorded an event on Feb. 17, could offer a key clue.",
      "\"That event would have been a cardiac arrest caused by an abnormal pulse rate,\" he said. \"The pacemaker keeps track of the pulse, and when it gets down too low, it discharges. And that's all in the record.\"",
      "Dr. Michael Baden shared his expert opinion on the \"unusual\" circumstances behind Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa's deaths. (Getty)",
      "\"So the autopsy showed he didn't have any injury,\" Baden continued. \"There was no carbon monoxide. And he had \u2014 the most common cause of death in this country \u2014 severe heart disease, coronary artery disease and high blood pressure perhaps, from what's been released. So that would cause him, having cardiac arrest in the mudroom, to collapse right there.\"",
      "In a search warrant affadvit released by the Santa Fe Sheriff's Office and obtained by Fox News Digital, investigators stated that they found Hackman's body on the floor in a mud-room with a walking cane and sunglasses nearby. According to the documents, the detectives suspected that the actor may have \"suddenly fallen.\"",
      "Baden shared his theory that Arakawa's death may have occurred after Hackman's pacemaker stopped while she was trying to help her husband.",

      "Baden explained that in an agitated state, Arakawa could have rushed to the bathroom to get Hackman's blood pressure medication before falling to the floor while scattering the pills and taking the space heater down with her.",
      "\"She may have struck her head on the way down and had some internal injury to the brain that doesn't show up on the outside or bleeding in the inside of the brain,\" Baden said. \"Or that she may also, at 65, had severe heart disease and excitement can cause a trigger to the cardiac rhythm causing death under those circumstances. I think the first, that striking her head would be more common.\"",
      "Baden theorized that Hackman suffered a cardiac event and Arakawa may have died while trying to get his medication. (Donaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)",
      "According to the affidavit, the deceased dog, a German Shepherd, was found \"10-15 feet\" away from Arakawa in a closet of the bathroom. Two other living dogs were discovered on the property. Detectives observed that \"one of the healthy dogs was initially observed near the deceased female (inside the bathroom) and the other healthy dog was observed outside the residence.\"",
      "\"What was perplexing to me initially with the release was the death of a dog also, which I thought was free in the house,\" Baden said. \"And that's why I think that the carbon monoxide[theory] was a very good thought with them breathing in the same air. But it turns out from what they say, that the dog was constrained in his cage or kennel and would have died from just dehydration and lack of water during the nine-day period that he couldn't get out of the kennel.\"",
      "Baden noted that his theory could explain why an emergency call wasn't immediately made after Hackman experienced the cardiac event on Feb. 17. A maintenance worker who discovered Hackman and Arakawa's bodies called 911 on Feb. 26.",

      "\"The circumstances and who he was \u2014 he was beloved by so many \u2014 are what make it so unusual,\" Baden said. \"Because heart disease and collapsing and dying with a pacemaker is common in the United States.\"",
      "\"But the circumstances of the two of them isolated by themselves,\" he continued. \"And that may have been the reason that 911 wasn't called, for example, while his wife was trying to get him some medication and fell.\"",

    "summary": "Is Pope Francis going to live? Is he going to die? Will he remain as pope? Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, shares his expert insights on the pope&apos;s condition and prognosis.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul has the latest on the Catholic leader's condition as many gather to pray for him on 'Special Report.'",
      "Is Pope Francis going to live? Is he going to die? Will he remain as pope?",
      "How much can be learned from the daily or twice-daily Vatican announcements and from media reports?",
      "Below are my current answers, based on my interpretation of the available information (which is, of course, subject to change).",
      "POPE FRANCIS\u2019 MEDICAL CONDITION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BILATERAL PNEUMONIA",
      "The pope has a long history of medical problems, including respiratory infections. Back in 1957, he had a piece of one lung removed.",
      "(Despite this, Pope Francis is not a smoker, and in fact ordered a ban on the sale of cigarettes in the Vatican\u2019s duty-free shop beginning in 2018.)",
      "Pope Francis holds the Holy Book of Prayers as he celebrates the Epiphany mass on January 6, 2020, at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.\u00a0 (Vincenzo Pinto/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The Catholic leader was last hospitalized for pneumonia in 2023. He previously underwent abdominal surgery, when part of his colon was removed.",
      "Most recently, the pope was hospitalized for a respiratory infection on Feb. 14, 2025, at Gemelli Hospital, one of the best hospitals in Italy.",
      "What is the pope's medical condition?",
      "The pope's condition has been described as bilateral pneumonia, which generally appears as consolidation on a chest x-ray or CT scan.",
      "Pneumonia is an infection in the air sacs of the lung. Bilateral pneumonia is more problematic and difficult to recover from than unilateral pneumonia or pneumonia in one lobe, especially in an elderly patient with scarring from previous surgeries and bouts of pneumonia.",
      "The pope is presumably being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is reportedly non-septic.",
      "LUNG CANCER RISING AMONG NON-SMOKERS \u2014 HERE'S WHY",
      "Though pneumonia is the most common cause of bacterial sepsis in the elderly, the statistic that one out of three cases leads to sepsis is misleading, because it refers to the period before the antibiotic era.",
      "Given that the pope has likely been given antibiotics for several days and appears to be stable, the chances of him developing sepsis are greatly reduced.",
      "What is sepsis?",
      "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition of hemodynamic compromise (where the body is not getting enough blood flow to function properly), which causes a drop in blood pressure.",
      "The condition generally causes a high fever, and heart and kidney output may decrease.",
      "\"Although the pope's prognosis is currently unknown, it doesn\u2019t sound like he is truly in critical condition.\"",
      "Often, a septic patient needs special drugs (pressors) to maintain blood pressure, and toxins and acid (lactate) can build up in the blood.",
      "Blood cultures can turn positive with a pathogen, which in this case would presumably be a bacteria.",
      "Why is the pope on oxygen?",
      "The pope is receiving what is known as high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula (a device that provides extra oxygen through a tube and into the nose), which can vary in oxygen percentage.",
      "This is a treatment for respiratory decompensation (breathing difficulties), but is not as aggressive as CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or mechanical ventilation.",
      "\"The fact that the pope is not currently on a ventilator is a good sign that he is not decompensating or septic and that his chances of recovery are possible or even probable,\" writes Dr. Marc Siegel. (Fox News)",
      "The fact that the pope is not currently on a ventilator is a good sign that he is not decompensating or septic and that his chances of recovery are possible or even probable.",
      "It is not yet clear why he needed blood transfusions (although they do improve oxygen-carrying ability) or why his platelet count was reportedly low.",
      "Reports of complications",
      "Over the weekend, on Saturday, the pope reportedly experienced an asthmatic episode, which was presumably treated with oxygen and with bronchodilators to open his airways (which constrict during an airway attack).",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "An existing asthmatic condition can be exacerbated by pneumonia. In the pope\u2019s case, it appears to have responded well to treatment.",

      "Pope Francis meets President Donald Trump in the Private Library of the Apostolic Palace at Vatican City on May 24, 2017. (Vatican/Pool/Galazka/Archivio Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori via Getty Images)",
      "While Pope Francis is certainly far from out of the woods, per Vatican reports, it is important to clarify that mild renal insufficiency simply means blood flow to the kidney is mildly reduced, perhaps from low volume or dehydration, and it might well be improving from the blood transfusions he is receiving.",
      "As long as his urine output keeps up and his kidney function doesn\u2019t worsen, this should not be a major obstacle.",
      "What is the pope's prognosis?",

      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data.

The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "7 ways you can protect yourself after a data breach like this",
      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

When we perform everyday tasks, our fingers move in coordinated patterns called \"postural synergies.\" These synergies are fundamental to how we grasp and manipulate objects. The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make. This information is then used to control the prosthetic hand.",

One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation.

      "Jose-Marie Griffiths discusses the increasingly important subject with Fox News Digital.",
      "It's early, but 2025 is not shaping up to be a great year for Mac cybersecurity.",
      "In less than two months, we've seen numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, which are generally considered very secure. These threats range from infostealers to malicious software capable of reading screenshots and stealing passwords.",
      "Now, Microsoft has identified a resurfaced malware that has returned after years, equipped with new malicious capabilities, including stealing sensitive information such as digital wallets and data from the legitimate Notes app.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",

      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious XCSSET.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protect your Mac from XCSSET and other threats by installing strong antivirus software on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets. The threats are getting smarter and more aggressive, and no platform is off-limits. Staying ahead means taking security seriously, because the bad guys definitely are.",

      "A\u00a0cybersecurity report by threat intelligence platform KELA has uncovered a sharp rise in infostealer malware in 2024. Researchers also observed an alarming trend in how stolen data was circulated. Large compilations of credentials, often referred to as \"credential lists,\" were being shared across cybercrime forums. These lists, primarily sourced from infostealer logs, contained billions of login details harvested from infected devices.",
      "One of the most notable incidents linked to infostealer malware was the breach of Snowflake, a cloud data storage provider. In April 2024, threat actors gained access to customer accounts using stolen login credentials, many of which were obtained through infostealers. Exploiting weak security practices, such as the absence of multifactor authentication, attackers extracted valuable data and later attempted to sell it on underground markets. The breach affected at least 165 companies.",

      "The KELA report highlights that hackers deploying Lumma, StealC, Redline and other infostealers infected 4.3 million machines, leading to the compromise of 330 million credentials. Nearly 40% of these infected machines contained credentials for corporate systems, including content management platforms, email accounts, Active Directory Federation Services and remote desktop environments. In total, this accounted for 1.7 million compromised bots and 7.5 million stolen credentials.",
      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs.

      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place.

      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

Or is it merely a quirk in the speech recognition patterns? One possible explanation is that the voice recognition software may be influenced by contextual data and usage patterns.",

      "I was one of the first to spit into a test tube, giving up my DNA forever to learn more about my health and heredity.\u00a0You know, the ones that promise to connect you with distant relatives you didn\u2019t even know existed or reveal genetic risks for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease. These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health. Even when it comes to ethnicity and ancestry, results usually rely on statistical comparisons to reference populations, which\u00a0don\u2019t necessarily yield accurate results, especially if you\u2019re from a less-studied ethnic group.",

According to an investigative journalist who tried to have her genetic footprint wiped, it was \"brutally difficult.\" Recent events, like 23andMe going bankrupt, highlight just how precarious the situation can be.",
      "Consumers are left worried about what will happen to their genetic data if a testing company is sold or acquired, especially when they have no easy way to retrieve or destroy that data. These companies often don\u2019t disclose where and how your samples are stored, either.",
      "According to Incogni, a data broker removal service, almost none of the DNA testing services it investigated provided any information more substantial than that of a \"secure facility.\" This lack of transparency about where their data is stored and how it can be destroyed creates a major roadblock for anyone trying to regain control over their genetic information.",

      "If you\u2019re still considering using a DNA service, if your genetic information has already been exposed or if you just want to take preventative steps, here are some things to do.",
      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",

From potential privacy violations to emotional surprises and the challenges of deleting your genetic data, DNA testing kits come with risks that many don\u2019t recognize upfront. If you\u2019re considering diving into your genetic blueprint, ask yourself: Are you comfortable with this data potentially ending up in the hands of marketers, law enforcement or even a company you didn\u2019t agree to share it with?",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rose Girone, believed to be the oldest living Holocaust survivor and a strong advocate for sharing survivors' stories, has died. She was 113.",
      "She died Monday in New York, according to the Claims Conference, a New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.",
      "MY FATHER SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST. CENSORSHIP DIDN\u2019T STOP THE NAZIS, IT HELPED THEM",
      "\"Rose was an example of fortitude but now we are obligated to carry on in her memory,\" Greg Schneider, Claims Conference executive vice president, said in a statement Thursday. \"The lessons of the Holocaust must not die with those who endured the suffering.\"",
      "Girone was born on January 13, 1912, in Janow, Poland. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany, when she was 6, she said in a filmed interview in 1996 with the USC Shoah Foundation.",
      "When asked by the interviewer if she had any particular career plans before Hitler, she said: \"Hitler came in 1933 and then it was over for everybody.\"",
      "Girone was one of about 245,000 survivors still living across more than 90 countries, according to a study released by the Claims Conference last year. Their numbers are quickly dwindling, as most are very old and often of frail health, with a median age of 86.",
      "Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.",
      "\"This passing reminds us of the urgency of sharing the lessons of the Holocaust while we still have first-hand witnesses with us,\" Schneider said. \"The Holocaust is slipping from memory to history, and its lessons are too important, especially in today\u2019s world, to be forgotten.\"",
      "Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.",
      "She was 9 months pregnant living in Breslau, which is now Wroclaw, Poland, when Nazis arrived to take Mannheim to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Their family had two cars and so she asked her husband to leave his keys.",

      "She said she remembers one Nazi saying: \"Take that woman also.\"",
      "The other Nazi responded: \"She\u2019s pregnant, leave her alone.\"",
      "The next morning her father-in-law was also taken and she was left alone with their housekeeper.",
      "After her daughter Reha was born in 1938, Girone was able to secure Chinese visas from relatives in London and secure her husband's release.",
      "In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only 6 months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.",
      "Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.",
      "But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three were forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bed bugs crawled through their belongings.",
      "Her father-in-law came just before World War II started but became sick and died. They had to wait in line for food and lived under the rule of a ruthless Japanese man who called himself \"King of the Jews.\"",
      "\"They did really horrible things to people,\" Girone said of the Japanese military trucks that patrolled the streets. \"One of our friends got killed because he wouldn\u2019t move fast enough.\"",
      "Information about the war in Europe only circulated in the form of rumors, as British radios were not allowed.",
      "When the war was over, they began receiving mail from Girone\u2019s mother, grandmother and other relatives in the U.S. With their help, they boarded a ship to San Francisco in 1947 with only $80, which Girone hid inside buttons.",
      "They arrived in New York City in 1947. She later started a knitting store with the help of her mother.",
      "Girone was also reunited with her brother, who went to France for school and ended up getting his U.S. citizenship by joining the Army. When she went to the airport to pick him up in New York, it was her first time seeing him in 17 years.",

      "Girone later divorced Mannheim. In 1968, she met Jack Girone, the same day her granddaughter was born. By the next year they were married. He died in 1990.",
      "When asked in 1996 for the message she would like to leave for her daughter and granddaughter, she said: \"Nothing is so very bad that something good shouldn't come out of it. No matter what it is.\""

While the initial investigation began in November 2023, outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi ordered all units to start probes in March 2024. The IDF refrained from offering recommendations in its report, saying that those would be left to incoming IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, who will enter the role next week.",

      "1. Oct. 7 in numbers",
      "According to the IDF\u2019s assessment, 5,000-5,600 militants infiltrated Israel in three waves. Meanwhile, 4,696 rockets and mortars were fired towards Israel. The attacks left 829 Israeli civilians, 76 foreign nationals and 415 security personnel dead. Additionally, 251 hostages were taken into the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fundamental failure was a result of failure to understand Hamas's intentions and readiness for a wide-scale surprise attack,\" IDF senior officials say in the report.",
      "2. Hamas attack timeline",
      "Hamas\u2019 attacks were not done hastily, according to the IDF, the planning began nearly seven years before the massacre, with the formation of the \"fundamental concept\" in November 2016 and an \"initial plan\" in July 2017. Hamas\u2019 plan was approved in July 2019 and the operational plan was set in August 2021. In early 2022, a readiness committee was established and over the course of the year the terror group evaluated options for implementing its plan.",
      "The IDF says Hamas considered numerous dates for the attacks, including Sept. 16, which was Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Sept. 25, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. Ultimately, Oct. 7, 2023, which coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which marks the end and re-start of the Torah.",

      "LOOKING BACK ON THE TIMELINE OF ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS AFTER OCT. 7",
      "3. Full timeline of Oct. 7",
      "The attack, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment began taking shape in the early hours of Oct. 7. Hamas allegedly began preparing its forces around 11:00 p.m. on Oct. 6, after spending much of the day putting them on alert and gathering weapons, and concluded briefings by 4:00 a.m. on Oct. 7.",
      "The infiltration itself began with the first wave at 6:29 a.m. when 1,154 members of Hamas\u2019 Nukhba forces invaded, breaking the security barrier between Gaza and Israel. The IDF declared a state of emergency at 6:43 a.m., and at 7:10 a.m. the Israeli Air Force (IAF) followed suit.",
      "Between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., 3,400 militants were inside Israeli territory. Additionally, just before 8:00 a.m., Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif called on civilians in Gaza to join the attacks. The assessment states that after 9:00 a.m. attackers took advantage of IDF failures and seized opportunities to further the assault. Some allegedly planned to go deeper into Israeli territory.",
      "Several of the \"main attacks\" were stopped by the IDF around 1:00 p.m., but there were still hundreds of attackers in Israel at 3:00 p.m. The IDF says it gained control of some of the communities and surrounding areas by 9:00 p.m., but dozens were present around midnight.",
      "\"We did not predict Hamas would be able to be so brutal in its fighting,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",
      "4. IDF\u2019s incorrect assessment of threats",
      "Much of the IDF\u2019s focus was on Iran and Hezbollah prior to the Oct. 7 attacks, and Hamas was defined as a secondary threat at the time. Additionally, the IDF assumed that it could contain Hamas activity as it worked toward \"gradually improving the existing reality\" with the goal of removing the terror group.",
      "The IDF also believed that \"Hamas didn\u2019t want a full-scale war,\" leading Israel to conclude that a large-scale invasion was unlikely. In the assessment, the IDF says Hamas took advantage of Israel\u2019s perception of the situation and used it to its advantage.",
      "Another major misconception highlighted in the assessment is the IDF\u2019s thinking that the main threat from Hamas were the rockets and mortars being shot from Gaza. This combined with reliance on defense tactics and a barrier, as well as the reduction of troops on the Israel-Gaza border would lead to catastrophe.",
      "5. Intelligence failures",
      "Israel\u2019s Intelligence Directorate did not fully grasp or analyze intel it had on Hamas and its intentions. This apparently also applies to the IDF\u2019s perception of the Shi\u2019ite \"Axis\" and its views on Israel. The IDF says that during the review it found deep-rooted systemic issues with the intelligence directorate and culture.",
      "Since 2018, the Intelligence Directorate had been gathering information on Hamas\u2019 concept for a large-scale attack on Israel. However, the plan was deemed unfeasible and was thought to reflect Hamas\u2019 long-term goals.",
      "In August 2021, intel on Hamas\u2019 military wing described the plan for a large-scale attack on Israeli communities and military outposts surrounding the Gaza Strip. Intelligence officials failed to make the connection between this new intel and what it had gathered in 2018.",
      "The intelligence received in the months leading up to Oct. 7 indicated that Hamas was carrying out training exercises for raids. This apparently changed Israel\u2019s elite Unit 8200\u2019s assessment of the situation, but this was allegedly not communicated with senior leadership.",

Those same sim cards would later allow Hamas militants to communicate after they crossed the border into Israel. There were also indications that night that Hamas leaders were meeting. However, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment, neither of these facts were enough to change the Intelligence Directorate\u2019s way of thinking on Gaza, therefore there was no alert.There were also indications of both usual and unusual Hamas activity that evening. The inquiry revealed that there were intelligence sources that could have been utilized overnight to enhance information that were not used. However, the IDF asserts that had the Intelligence Directive changed its assessment of the situation, there would have been a higher alert for a localized Hamas offensive, but not for an all-out war.",
      "7. Assessment of the IAF",
      "The IAF was found to have met and even exceeded the defined standards for readiness except for two instances due to heavy rocket fire. However, these standards did not align with what would have been required to prepare for a large-scale surprise attack. The IDF concluded that there was \"significant difficulty\" distinguishing IDF troops, civilians and terrorists from one another.",
      "While the IAF struck key Hamas command centers, the IDF admits that even in its review of the strikes it is challenging to determine if there could have been a more effective strike effort given the circumstances.",
      "However, it was noted that the IDF did not prepare for anything like the brutal Oct. 7 massacre.\"We were addicted to the precise intelligence and information we got as commanders and did not consider other scenarios. This failure will forever be etched in our memories, and we will never and should never forget,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",

      "In its conclusion, the IDF notes that the assessment of the situation in Gaza and regarding Hamas was so entrenched in the establishment that there was no deep discussion about alternate possibilities. Additionally, it now says that it was \"incorrect\" to try to \"conflict manage\" Hamas and, in the future, the removal of threats should be prioritized.",
      "The assessment also addresses the possibility of a future attack, saying that a preventative strategy will be key.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has long warned about an entrenched \u201cdeep state\u201d of malevolent bureaucrats working to thwart his agenda. Many actual employees of the federal government have scoffed at this characterization, proud of the apolitical nature of the civil service and its ability to work across Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "This time might have been no different \u2014 if Trump and Elon Musk hadn\u2019t come in and declared war on them.",
      "While there were conflicts between Trump and civil servants in his first term, Trump may now be creating the broad resistance within the federal government he thought was there all along.",
      "We\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers who have been laid off. If you\u2019re willing to talk with us, please email us at\u00a0tips@nbcuni.com\u00a0or\u00a0contact us\u00a0through one of these methods.",
      "Protests opposing the cuts and supporting laid-off workers have started popping up, but the real hotbed of organizing has been happening online, in Signal chats, on Facebook and in the popular \u201cFedNews\u201d channel on Reddit, where federal workers are sharing advice, talking about their experiences and encouraging opposition.",
      "\u201cKEEP SHOUTING THE TRUTH, KEEP RINGING THE BELL: It\u2019s working!\u201d read a post last week. \u201cI just got a mass email from my agency branch \u2018reminding\u2019 us not to talk to the media, listing several regulations that state we\u2019re not to talk to the media. They wouldn\u2019t have sent that if the media wasn\u2019t getting FLOODED with federal workers reporting the truth, reporting what is REALLY going on. It\u2019s affecting them.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard so many people ask: WHY is Donald T. so hell-bent on destroying Federal workers?\u201d read another recent post. \u201cBecause we are in his way. \u2026 Hold the line.\u201d",
      "The totality of the effort is quite broad. Workers are filing lawsuits, joining protests and sharing internal documents with media outlets. They\u2019ve launched anonymous websites and social media accounts to promote their narratives. They\u2019ve built resource guides and recorded private meetings. And they\u2019ve resigned, sometimes in large numbers, to protest Musk and the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "Amy Paris, who worked at the Health Resources and Services Administration, said she would \u201chave very willingly collaborated with the Trump administration\u201d if it had come in and looked for ways to increase efficiency. Instead, she and thousands of other federal workers were laid off last month.",
      "\u201cThey sowed chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made everyone scared for their jobs. \u2026 What they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve radicalized me. What they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve taken someone who would have willingly served under their administration to help all of the American people, and what they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve made me think that they want to destroy the republic. They want to destroy democracy. So now I am activated.\u201d",
      "Before she was fired, Paris was working on modernizing the federal web platform for organ transplants. She is considering appealing her termination.",
      "One civil servant at an agency within the Department of Commerce said they previously thought the idea of a \u201cdeep state\u201d was \u201cludicrous.\u201d Now, however, they believe Trump and Musk have created the conditions for such a \u201cresistance\u201d to thrive.",
      "\u201cThat is definitely something that appears to be happening,\u201d this person said. \u201cI do not believe the deep state existed before, but they could be getting something like that as a response. \u2026 Not trying to take over the world, just trying to oppose this.\u201d",
      "Limited options",
      "The Trump administration first targeted federal employees tied to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The Office of Personnel Management, which has been working closely with Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency effort, then offered most of the 2 million-plus federal workforce a \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d to leave their positions. Weeks of confusion and court battles followed, though the program was allowed to move forward.",
      "Next, the administration proceeded to go after people like Paris, who are either new to the federal government and don\u2019t yet have full civil service protections, transferred to new departments or took a promotion. Many of these employees were told they were being let go for performance reasons, even though they had exemplary reviews.",
      "The next step will be a \u201creduction in force,\u201d which will mean large-scale layoffs across agencies, according to a new OPM memo. All along the way, Musk and other members of the Trump administration have belittled, insulted and mischaracterized federal workers.",
      "The episode that stood out most to federal workers was a line in an FAQ that OPM shared to answer questions about the deferred resignation program that they felt diminished their efforts.",
      "\u201cThe way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector,\u201d the comment read.",
      "Musk himself has sent a number of missives to civil servants, including when he posted that he is \u201c1000% more trustworthy than untold numbers of deep state bureaucrats and fraudsters\u201d or wrote on X that \u201ca significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!\u201d",
      "That last comment followed Musk\u2019s latest effort: telling federal workers that their jobs are at risk if they don\u2019t respond to an email asking them to provide five bullet points on what they did the previous week. That email was sent by OPM on Feb. 22, a Saturday. But it was only on his social media platform X that Musk said a failure to respond would be taken as a resignation. A second such email started going out Friday evening.",
      "The options for resistance are increasingly limited. Soon after taking office, Trump fired 18 inspectors general, who act as internal agency watchdogs. He also tried to remove Hampton Dellinger, who leads an agency tasked with whistleblower protection, as well as the chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent body that weighs federal workers\u2019 employment appeals. (Federal judges have so far blocked those moves.) Both Dellinger and the MSPB chair were appointed by President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cAnyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers across the country who overwhelmingly re-elected him.\u201d",
      "With few options for pushback, federal workers have centered their opposition on influencing public opinion and shaping narratives. They\u2019re seeking to counter not just Trump and Musk\u2019s effort, but decades of public perception that civil servants are unproductive and prone to wasting the taxpayer dime. They\u2019ve held protests outside agencies DOGE has targeted, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of the Treasury. And the National Treasury Employees Union is slated to hold a protest near the Capitol on Wednesday.",
      "They may also be getting more involved politically \u2014 with some expressing interest in running for office. Outside of a recent Democratic Party event in Virginia, a man named Matthew described himself as a political independent who never previously attended a Democratic gathering. That was until he was recently fired from his federal job.",
      "Asked if the layoffs may factor into his vote in the state\u2019s 2025 governor\u2019s race, he said: \u201c100%.\u201d",
      "\u2018We are all desperately trying to figure out how to navigate this\u2019",
      "But a number of federal workers who spoke with NBC News said they recoil at the idea of being hostile to the administration writ large.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with the word combat, because it shouldn\u2019t ever be adversarial, right?\u201d one assistant U.S. attorney said. \u201cWe are all desperately trying to figure out how to navigate this. Whether or not I agree with the administration\u2019s priorities or their worldview of anything is absolutely, positively not relevant. And I worked for this administration the first time. \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever agreed with 100% of any administration\u2019s priorities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I haven\u2019t dealt with so far, and where I think we\u2019re all extremely troubled, is that some of what is happening now appears to any reasonable observer to be blatantly unconstitutional,\u201d this person added. \u201cAnd so the question that we have in our minds is, how do we try to advance the administration\u2019s objectives without running afoul of the law, quite frankly.\u201d",
      "A staffer at the Small Business Administration said \u201ceverybody\u2019s too afraid\u201d to take actions that could risk their employment.",
      "But those who have already been fired have had fewer reservations. Already, Democratic lawmakers including Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have highlighted stories from ousted federal workers on the services they provided the public and what the firings have meant to them personally.",
      "Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said the most effective pushback to the cuts involves sharing stories \u201cabout how the public is getting hurt.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey need to share not just what\u2019s happening to them personally, which is important, but what\u2019s happening to the public as a result of the chaotic management that is current now,\u201d he said.",
      "Stier said the firings of the head of the Office of Special Counsel and inspectors general have served as a warning to any employees who consider speaking out \u2014\u00a0even internally.",
      "\u201cBy their oath of office, [civil servants] have a responsibility to speak up,\u201d Stier said. \u201cBut I think you have an incredibly difficult situation for them because they\u2019re being taught that to do so puts them in an additional harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "Republicans have largely expressed resounding support for DOGE\u2019s mission to cut federal spending and staffing, pointing to surveys that show support for streamlining government and adding that the mission was not only core to Trump\u2019s presidential bid but is an undertaking that any Republican officeholder in this era would be pursuing.",
      "But some grumblings over the effort have arisen, whether over Musk appearing to usurp powers that should be reserved for Trump\u2019s Cabinet heads, a lack of compassion in the broader restructuring, or having Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, be the face of the effort.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it sparks a resistance,\u201d one Trump ally said. \u201cI think those days are long over. I just think there\u2019s risk and potential blowback on the political side if something gets messed up. I also think there\u2019s risk in department heads appointed by the president clashing with Musk. You are already kind of seeing it in some instances.\u201d",
      "At Wednesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting, Trump asked Cabinet heads directly if anyone was \u201cunhappy\u201d with Musk\u2019s leadership. None spoke up against him.",
      "\u201cI still think what they\u2019re doing is broadly popular, just that Elon is very off-putting and unpopular,\u201d a senior Senate GOP aide said, adding that the job cuts so far are small when compared to the depth of the federal workforce as a whole. \u201cElon does this all very chaotically, but this is actually something I think you could have seen any generic Republican admin doing.\u201d",
      "Republicans have faced heat at town halls over the effort while others have shared concerns from federal workers in their own states. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., told NBC News his \u201cbiggest concern is that we\u2019re being compassionate.\u201d Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d: \u201cIf I could say one thing to Elon Musk it\u2019s, \u2018Please put a dose of compassion in this. These are real people. These are real lives.\u2019\u201d And Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Monday called for \u201cjust a little bit of humanity and dignity to the process.\u201d",
      "Musk himself has bristled at some of the pushback, lamenting what he sees as a certain level of ridiculousness over federal employees stressing about responding to an email calling for them to list out their accomplishments.",
      "\u201cThe email request was utterly trivial, as the standard for passing the test was to type some words and press send! Yet so many failed \u2026 urged on in some cases by their managers,\u201d he posted to X. \u201cHave you ever witnessed such INCOMPETENCE and CONTEMPT for how YOUR TAXES are being spent? Makes old Twitter look good. Didn\u2019t think that was possible.\u201d",
      "But as civil servants and their advocates noted, there are codified processes by which federal employees have to go through performance reviews, are disciplined or terminated, and that the DOGE effort has so far skirted these systems.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of civil servants who are trying in the best ways that they know how to resist what they believe are illegal actions,\u201d Paris said, adding: \u201cThese are not people who are well-skilled in the idea of a resistance movement.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "SpaceX plans to launch its Starship megarocket on its next test flight on Monday, roughly six weeks after the vehicle\u2019s upper stage blew up over the Atlantic Ocean during the last such test.",
      "In that mishap on Jan. 16, SpaceX lost communication with Starship about eight minutes into the flight, and the vehicle\u2019s subsequent explosion sent debris streaking through the sky. Dust and small pieces rained over parts of Turks and Caicos, but local authorities said there were no injuries.",
      "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration launched an investigation after the accident and grounded the rocket during the probe. On Friday, the agency cleared Starship to return to flight but said its investigation remains open.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s own investigation found that the likely root cause was leaking propellant in a section of Starship known as the \u201cattic,\u201d which is located between the bottom of the liquid oxygen tank and the rear heat shield.",
      "The leak likely sparked \u201csustained fires\u201d that eventually caused \u201call but one of Starship\u2019s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences,\u201d SpaceX said in an update on Monday.",
      "The company said it stopped receiving data just over eight minutes into the test flight, and that the vehicle broke apart three minutes after that.",
      "SpaceX said it has since made \u201cseveral hardware and operational changes\u201d to Starship\u2019s upper stage, but the company did not specify what those upgrades were.",
      "The upcoming test flight, Starship\u2019s eighth, was originally scheduled for Friday; no explanation was provided for the short delay.",
      "The FAA, which signed off on the flight, is one of many federal agencies that the Trump administration has targeted for budget and personnel cuts. Reuters reported that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, has infiltrated FAA facilities and that SpaceX engineers have been working at the agency as special government employees.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether DOGE employees have had a presence within the FAA\u2019s commercial spaceflight division, which oversees private companies like SpaceX, but some lawmakers and critics, including Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., have nonetheless raised concerns about Musk\u2019s conflicts of interest.",
      "If Starship launches as intended on Monday, it will attempt to release four mock Starlink satellites during the flight. If successful, that would mark the first time the vehicle has deployed a payload.",
      "The plan also calls for the megarocket\u2019s hulking first stage to return to the launchpad after separating from the second stage, and for SpaceX to \u201ccatch\u201d it there using giant mechanical arms on the rocket\u2019s launch tower. SpaceX completed that part as intended during the January flight, leading the company to deem the test a partial success.",
      "The catch maneuver is a key part of SpaceX\u2019s goal to make Starship a fully reusable rocket system.",
      "If all goes according to plan, the vehicle\u2019s upper stage will fly for about an hour on Monday before splashing down in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Western Australia.",
      "Starship is the most powerful rocket ever developed, measuring 400 feet tall. The system has two parts: a first-stage booster known as Super Heavy and an upper-stage spacecraft.",
      "It is expected to play a crucial part in NASA\u2019s efforts to return to the moon. The agency selected SpaceX to carry astronauts to the lunar surface during NASA\u2019s planned Artemis III mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2027. Musk has also said Starship could be used for future missions to Mars."

      "Using an espresso machine in his hotel room, Butler opened what could be considered the first location of Bigface, a coffee brand that Butler has since turned into a legitimate business. In the bubble, however, Butler was looking for a way to take his mind off of basketball \u2014 and take advantage of his rich, captive clientele, charging $20 per drink. (Hence the name Bigface.)",
      "Butler\u2019s first customer was his then-Miami Heat teammate Goran Dragic, whom Butler affectionately refers to as his brate, or brother in Slovenian. Except, according to Butler, Dragic never paid the hefty fee for all his drinks.",

      "It already has the world\u2019s largest navy, but new satellite imagery shows that China is developing a huge nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that would rival the biggest vessel in the American fleet, five analysts told NBC News after studying new satellite imagery.",
      "The images of China\u2019s Dalian shipbuilding facility in northeast China suggest that the new ship will allow fighter jets to be launched from four parts of the flight deck, leading analysts to conclude that the images suggest a new ship design \u2014 unlike anything now in the Chinese fleet.",
      "The analysts made the assessment after examining images provided to NBC News by Maxar Technologies, a defense contractor headquartered in Colorado used by the U.S. government.",
      "China\u2019s three current aircraft carriers have the capacity to launch jets from only three parts on the front and the waist, or center, on the deck. Its latest supercarrier, the recently launched Fujian, a Type 003, has three electromagnetic catapult launching systems to propel fighter jets, Duitsman said.",
      "The U.S. has 11 supercarriers that can launch from four places.",
      "\u201cWe think this is them testing equipment and layouts for the upcoming Type 04 carrier,\u201d Michael Duitsman, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, a California-based nongovernment organization devoted to curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, said in a video call this week.",
      "The general consensus, he said, is\" that the new carrier will have four catapults,\u201d which would allow more planes to take off and match U.S. carriers like the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's largest and most advanced aircraft carrier. To accommodate four catapults, the ship will need to be larger than the Fujian, matching American tonnage and powered by a nuclear reactor.",

    "story": [
      "A budget resolution adopted Tuesday by House Republicans could jeopardize the health insurance coverage of millions of low-income and disabled people who rely on Medicaid if lawmakers follow through with their proposed spending cuts, experts warn.",
      "The budget plan instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, to identify at least $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts over the next 10 years. The savings are expected to be used to extend President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of this year.",
      "While the resolution doesn\u2019t specifically mention Medicaid, experts say it would be unfeasible for Republicans to hit that target without significant cuts to the health program, since it\u2019s one of the largest sources of federal spending, costing more than $600 billion per year, according to government data.",
      "\u201cThe way the math would work is that those cuts would largely need to come out of Medicaid,\u201d said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a nonprofit group that focuses on health policy. \u201cMedicare is off the table, and there just aren\u2019t any other sources of funding for the Energy Commerce to look at.\u201d (During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to preserve Medicare.)",
      "The possible cuts are expected to extend beyond those who benefited from the 2014 Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, potentially affecting nearly all of the people in the program.",
      "\u201cEveryone who relies on Medicaid would be at risk,\u201d said Edwin Park, a research professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 \u201cSpecifics of the proposal will matter \u2014 each state will be hit, and how hard they\u2019ll be hit will vary \u2014 but certainly they\u2019re all at risk.\u201d",
      "Who does Medicaid cover?",
      "Medicaid provides health insurance primarily to people with low incomes, although it covers other groups including some older adults, pregnant women and people with disabilities. That includes about 72 million people.",
      "In 2023, Medicaid covered nearly 4 in 10 children, including over 8 in 10 children in poverty, 1 in 6 adults, and almost half of adults in poverty, according to KFF. The program covers more than 1 in 4 adults with disabilities and provides coverage for 41% of all births in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Medicare and Social Security are sort of these sacrosanct programs and Medicaid is often not lumped into the category,\u201d said Allison Orris, the director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank. \u201cPolling over the last few years shows that two- thirds of adults in the U.S. have some connection to Medicaid, and almost three- quarters of the population have a generally favorable view of the program. And that\u2019s because Medicaid really touches people and provides health care at all stages of life.\u201d",
      "The program is jointly funded by states and the federal government. States cover the upfront cost of care and then are reimbursed by the federal government for at least 50%.",
      "When the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to more people, the federal government committed to paying at least 90% of the total costs for the people who enrolled due to the expansion in each state.",
      "The share of people on Medicaid varies by state, but the states with the highest number of enrollees include California, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and New York, according to KFF. The program covers nearly half of Puerto Rico residents, the largest share among states and territories. Only 10 states, including Florida and Texas, don\u2019t participate in Medicaid\u2019s expansion.",
      "With fewer dollars coming from the federal government, states would bear a larger share of Medicaid costs, which many would likely struggle to afford, Orris said.",
      "\u201cCapping federal spending doesn\u2019t make health care needs go away,\u201d Orris said. \u201cIt just shifts the risk of higher spending to states and makes states make choices about: do they cut coverage, do they cut eligibility, do they cut provider rates?\u201d",
      "What about fraud in Medicaid?",
      "The GOP House budget plan is only the first step in a series of negotiations between House and Senate lawmakers before a bill can reach Trump\u2019s desk.",
      "Republican leaders have argued that the proposed budget cuts would eliminate fraud in Medicaid, but Park, of Georgetown, said there\u2019s no data to support the claim that fraud is more prevalent in Medicaid than in other parts of the health care system, including Medicare and private insurance.",
      "On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on CNN that lawmakers were not going to make cuts to Medicaid benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of those who are rightful beneficiaries of the program,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut the fraud, waste and abuse and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get the savings to accomplish this mission.\u201d",
      "Park said that\u2019s misleading.",
      "\u201cThe fraud argument is being used as a frame to justify Medicaid cuts, but the major proposals that are under consideration today to achieve this $880 billion target are the same major Medicaid cuts that were included in the [2017] Affordable Care Act repeal and replace bills that ultimately failed,\u201d Park said. \u201cBack then, there was no talk about combating fraud or waste or abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to hurt enrollees, we\u2019re not going to hurt people, we\u2019re just going to deal with waste, fraud and abuse,\u2019\u201d Orris said. \u201cBut I think we need to unpack that and understand that just like any health care program, there are some improper payments in Medicaid, which generally result from paperwork not being filled out. That happens across all programs.\u201d",
      "The argument, experts say, shifts the focus away from the harms that would come to people across age and income spectrum if Medicaid gets cuts.",
      "\u201cCongress is very unlikely to say, \u2018Dear states, you need to cut coverage for people with disabilities,\u2019\u201d Orris said. \u201cAll of those hard decisions are going to be left for states to make and it\u2019s hard to say that any population would be spared, especially if you get into the realms of cuts that are big enough that lead to hospitals closing and impacting access to care.\u201d",
      "Without Medicaid coverage, people often don\u2019t have any other options.",
      "\u201cMedicaid is such a complicated program, and it covers so many different facets of the health care system, many of which people don\u2019t fully appreciate,\u201d Rudowitz said. \u201cWe know that most people who lose Medicaid would likely become uninsured and then would still need health care services, and may still show up to clinics, and those providers would likely not be reimbursed.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The overhaul of South Carolina\u2019s death chamber was completed three years ago. Now, a team of sharpshooters is practicing its aim for what is poised to be the first firing squad execution in the state\u2019s history on Friday.",
      "Death by firing squad remains an extremely uncommon form of capital punishment in the United States, with only three carried out since the death penalty was ruled constitutional in 1976. All three occurred in Utah \u2014 the last in 2010, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Brad Sigmon, the condemned South Carolina prisoner, opted for firing squad over the state\u2019s primary method of electrocution or the more widely used practice of lethal injection.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s made the best choice that he can, but the fact that he had to make it at all is horrifying,\u201d said Sigmon\u2019s lawyer, Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King.",
      "Sigmon, 67, who was convicted in 2002 in the beating deaths of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s parents, declined lethal injection, King said, because of concerns over its use in the last three executions in South Carolina.",
      "In a filing last week asking the South Carolina Supreme Court to halt Sigmon\u2019s execution, his legal team noted the state\u2019s autopsy report for Marion Bowman Jr., who was put to death by lethal injection last month, indicates he was given \u201c10 grams of pentobarbital\u201d and \u201cdied with his lungs massively swollen with blood and fluid,\u201d akin to \u201cdrowning.\u201d",
      "That amount of pentobarbital is double what corrections officials had attested to needing under the state\u2019s lethal injection protocol, according to the filing.",
      "King argued that the state must disclose more information about the protocol and the quality of its pentobarbital on hand in order for Sigmon to have made a fair choice.",
      "State prosecutors said in a response Friday to Sigmon\u2019s filing that because he chose death by firing squad, he has \u201cwaived any argument about lethal injection.\u201d They also contend the second dose of pentobarbital was administered as outlined under the state\u2019s protocol and nothing was unusual with how the other inmates died.",
      "With Sigmon\u2019s execution drawing closer, barring a last-minute reprieve, the return of a firing squad execution is also raising questions about whether it is ushering a new \u2014 yet old \u2014 chapter in America\u2019s use of the death penalty.",
      "During the Civil War, firing squads were common for executing soldiers for desertion; in some cases, they would be blindfolded and tied to stakes before being shot. A century ago, Nevada executed a prisoner using an automated machine that fired the bullets so that no person had to.",
      "In the modern era of capital punishment, only a handful of states, including Mississippi and Oklahoma, allow for the method, with South Carolina legalizing it in 2021 and Idaho following two years later amid a nationwide shortage of lethal injection drugs.",
      "Corinna Barrett Lain, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said states are moving to the firing squad because lethal injection has been problematic, with reports of \u201cbotched\u201d incidents in recent years.",
      "\u201cStates can\u2019t get the drugs. They can\u2019t get qualified medical professionals to do it,\u201d Lain, the author of the upcoming book \u201cSecrets of the Killing State: The Untold Story of Lethal Injection,\u201d said in an email.",
      "\u201cThe firing squad is too honest, too explicit about what the death penalty is. People tend to think it\u2019s barbaric and archaic,\u201d Lain said, adding: \u201cIn that way, it may start some very important, and long overdue conversations about the death penalty in this country.\u201d",
      "Utah\u2019s use of the firing squad",
      "The last firing squad execution, in 2010, lasted about four minutes, from when the death chamber\u2019s curtain was lifted to when the bullets struck Utah inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner, according to media witnesses.",
      "Gardner, 49, was sentenced to death after fatally shooting an attorney, Michael Burdell, and wounding a bailiff, George Kirk, as he attempted to flee a courthouse in 1985. Gardner was already in custody for the killing of a bartender, Melvyn John Otterstrom, a year earlier.",
      "Prison staff members strapped Gardner to a chair, and after he declined to make a final statement, fit a black hood over his head. A small white target with a bull\u2019s-eye pattern was fastened to his chest. Five shooters \u2014 volunteers described as certified police officers \u2014 fired .30-caliber Winchester rifles from behind a wall with a gun port.",
      "The number of shooters helped to ensure one of the bullets was fatal, although one firearm was also fed a blank so that each shooter was uncertain who was directly responsible for the death, officials said.",
      "Media witnesses described Gardner appearing to flinch and move his arm after being shot, leaving them to wonder if he was still alive and would have to be shot again. But a medical examiner declared him dead a short time later, they said.",
      "Jennifer Dobner, who covered the execution for The Associated Press, said it was a \u201cvery clinical and precise procedure.\u201d Fifteen years later, she still recalls a \u201cboom, boom\u201d from the rapid gunfire, then \u201cthe target on his chest kind of blew up, the fabric kind of blew up,\u201d and the room fell silent. The execution was traumatic for the Gardner family, she said.",
      "\u201cThey have their own trauma from losing their brother this way. Not that they condone anything that he did, but it is a very extreme form of punishment,\u201d Dobner said.",
      "Jamie Stewart, Kirk\u2019s granddaughter, witnessed Gardner\u2019s execution with her grandmother. Kirk died a decade after the shooting.",
      "Stewart said she initially thought the execution was going to be more gruesome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s over really quick,\u201d Stewart said in a text. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything like I expected it to be.\u201d",
      "To her, it was \u201cthe most humane\u201d way for Gardner to die, she said. \u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s horrible to die this way, but how many botched firing squad executions have there been?\u201d",
      "Gardner\u2019s death \u201cgave me closure,\u201d she added. \u201cThat monster finally paid for his crimes.\u201d",
      "Gardner\u2019s brother Randy Gardner said none of his family witnessed the execution but he has since become an advocate against the death penalty.",

      "What is planned in South Carolina",
      "At the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia, the shooters are volunteers employed by the Department of Corrections. Per officials, the three-person squad will fire rifles, all with live ammunition, from behind a wall about 15 feet from the inmate, who will be seated.",
      "Before the shooting, the inmate is allowed to make a last statement, then a hood is placed over his head and a target pinned over his heart. Bullet-resistant glass separates the chamber from another room where witnesses, including media, will be permitted.",

      "The execution chamber is located beside death row, and King said inmates \u201chave been treated to the unsettling experience of hearing a lot of gunfire.\u201d",

      "His friend and former business partner, Doug Lanham, 76, said he played golf with Hackman, and while on the course, they\u2019d make bets \u2014 something he said Hackman never thought was a good idea.",

      "Lanham and Hackman met years ago, when Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, came into the restaurant Lanham owns, Jinja Bar & Bistro in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with a mutual friend. Lanham said he invited the couple back the next day to cook at his restaurant, and the couple obliged.",

      "Lanham discussed how the couple helped a lot of local businesses financially, \u201cbut always under the radar,\u201d he said, because they didn\u2019t want or need the credit. The same goes for the 14 original artworks Hackman painted that line the walls of Jinja \u2014 none of them are signed; another attempt by the Hollywood icon to steer focus away from himself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, it\u2019s perplexing,\u201d Lanham said of their deaths and the mystery surrounding them. \u201cThey were so dignified and to read about it, to hear about it, there\u2019s no way to connect the dots when you know them as people.\u201d",
      "Lanham expected that his friend would die one day \u2014 Hackman was 95 at the time of his death \u2014 \u201cBut not like this,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not very dogmatic about it, and I think that writing in general, even if you\u2019re writing something on your own, which we both occasionally do as well, it\u2019s an improvisational process where, you know, the first rule of improv is, you know, never say no,\u201d Corbet said. \u201cAnd I think that chasing a story, chasing an idea, it\u2019s about riffing and building on each other\u2019s proposals.\u201d",
      "A long road to awards season",
      "The duo\u2019s hard work paved the way for critical acclaim and awards buzz. Corbet has already racked up best director honors at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, the U.K.\u2019s equivalent of the Academy Awards. Brody, Jones and Pearce are all nominated for acting Oscars.",
      "But it was a tough road to the Academy Awards for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which is three hours and 35 minutes (including an intermission that's reminiscent of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age epics).",
      "As he promoted the film, Corbet made headlines for underscoring how tough it is to make a living as a filmmaker. In a recent interview on\u00a0the \u201cWTF With Marc Maron\u201d podcast, Corbet said he and Fastvold \u201cmade zero dollars on the last two films we made,\u201d noting that they \u201chad to just live off of a paycheck from three years ago.\u201d",
      "Lining up financing for \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was tough, too. Corbet and Fastvold said they were turned down by multiple potential investors.",
      "\u201cIf I were in their position, I probably would have passed, too,\u201d Corbet said. \u201cIt was following a global pandemic. People were not going to the movies.\u201d",
      "Eventually, along with some of their own savings, Corbet and Fastvold scraped together enough financing to make the movie for about $10 million. That\u2019s a fraction of what large-scale Hollywood movies typically cost. For comparison, last year\u2019s best picture Oscar winner, the three-hour historical drama \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d reportedly was budgeted at $100 million. (Universal Pictures, which released \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and whose international arm distributed \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d outside North America, shares a parent company with NBC News.)",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d wrapped filming in May 2023 and then premiered last year at the Venice Film Festival, where it earned rave reviews. It was scooped up by prestigious studio and distributor A24, which positioned the movie in the thick of the Oscar race.",
      "The film generated some controversy, as well, after editor D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3 said filmmakers used artificial intelligence to enhance Brody\u2019s and Jones\u2019 Hungarian accents. Corbet and Fastvold told NBC News their use of the technology was minimal, ethical \u2014 and necessary.",
      "\u201cI wanted Hungarians to be able to watch the film and have it ring true for them,\u201d Corbet said.",
      "Home again",
      "Beyond the accolades, \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is a major personal milestone for Corbet, 36, who was raised by a single mom, dropped out of high school and started acting in films such as 2003\u2019s \u201cThirteen\u201d before settling into the director\u2019s chair.",
      "\u201cI did not go to film school at all. I did grow up on film sets, and so, of course, there\u2019s probably no better education than that,\u201d he said.",
      "The success of \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is also gratifying for Corbet\u2019s mother, Mary. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very touched by it,\u201d the director said.",
      "As awards season comes to a crescendo, Corbet and Fastvold are looking forward to some family time \u2014 away from the set. The morning after the Oscars, it\u2019s back to their life in Brooklyn, New York.",
      "\u201cYou just gotta go home and, you know, pack lunch and make dinner and then \u2026 we go back into a dark room and keep on trying to make another movie,\u201d Fastvold said.",
      "Corbet, meanwhile, said he\u2019s eager to \u201cbe just dad\u201d again after months of hopping on planes every few days and visiting more than a dozen countries.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been away too much,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that when we finally sort of slow down, we\u2019ll really, really be able to appreciate it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country\u201d in order for Ukraine to continue pursuing a peace deal negotiated by the U.S.",
      "His comments come just two days after President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy publicly sparred in the Oval Office while the Ukrainian president visited Washington to finish negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is trying to get these two parties to a point of peace,\u201d Johnson said during an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding: \u201cWhat President Zelenskyy did in the White House was effectively signal to us that he\u2019s not ready for that yet, and I think that\u2019s a great disappointment.\u201d",
      "Johnson emphasized that Trump \u201chas been very clear about this \u2014\u00a0that if [Zelenskyy] is ready for peace, then we can negotiate a deal.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he was seeking to include security guarantees \u2014 or assurances that the U.S. would come to Ukraine\u2019s aid if Russia violates a ceasefire deal \u2014 in the mineral rights agreement.",
      "In the Oval Office spat, Trump told Zelenskyy that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the cards\u201d to negotiate and joined Vance in asking the Ukrainian president to be more grateful for U.S. support for Ukraine.",
      "Following the contentious meeting, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called on Zelenskyy to resign, telling reporters at the White House that the meeting was a \"complete, utter disaster.\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham said, adding that the Ukrainian president, \"either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Johnson on Sunday echoed the president and vice president, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker that Zelenskyy \u201cberated and interrupted his host, instead of expressing gratitude for the extraordinary help that the U.S. has provided his country.\u201d",
      "Johnson also argued that security guarantees were inherent in the mineral rights deal, telling Welker, \u201cThis mineral rights deal is a win, a win for everyone. It will give us access to rare earth minerals that we need, and it will provide a level of security for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey will effectively be in an economic partnership with us after that point, and we will definitely always defend our interests and our investments,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cRussia knows that. China knows that. Iran, North Korea know that, and that\u2019s a very important message for us.\u201d",
      "Asked if Putin was the \"winner\" in the fallout from the tense Oval Office exchange, Johnson said \"No, he wasn't.\"",
      "In an interview later on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., pushed back on GOP officials\u2019 calls for Zelenskyy to resign, telling Welker, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in calling on the resignation of other world leaders.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrankly, I think that would spiral Ukraine into chaos right now, trying to find who is the negotiator\u201d for a peace deal, Lankford added.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also pushed back on calls for Zelenskyy to resign, calling it a \"horrific suggestion\" on \"Meet the Press\" later Sunday.",
      "\"Zelenskyy is leading a country, trying to defend democracy against an authoritarian dictator \u2014 Putin \u2014 who invaded his country,\" Sanders added.",
      "Johnson also spoke about the massive budget reconciliation bill that House Republicans passed last week, which now heads to a group of House and Senate GOP leaders as they seek to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions on the bill.",
      "House Republicans\u2019 bill includes $2 trillion in spending cuts, which some opponents of the measure say could impact Medicaid funding, affecting health care and insurance for millions of low-income and disabled people.",
      "Johnson on Sunday said that House Republicans did not intend to touch Medicaid funding in the budget bill, telling Welker, \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it, Kristen, go do a word search of the budget resolution that we passed on Tuesday. There is not one mention of Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American people want us to review the expenditures of the country and get our fiscal house in order, and that\u2019s what we must do,\u201d Johnson said, adding that House Republicans also want to extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts measure, which expires this year.",
      "\u201cWe can do both of those things simultaneously and not affect benefits for anyone who relies upon those and is eligible to receive them,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "But on Friday, Trump adviser and tech mogul Elon Musk made several false claims about Social Security, signaling that he would seek to evaluate that agency for cuts in the future.",
      "Asked whether Social Security is Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s next target, Johnson told Welker, \u201cI\u2019ve met with Elon about this multiple times. We meet late into the night in his office, and we\u2019ve looked at that. What he\u2019s finding with his algorithms crawling through the data of Social Security system is enormous amounts of fraud, waste and abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a moral responsibility to ensure that those programs are conducted in a way that does not allow for this, this massive fraud and abuse, and that\u2019s what he is finding,\u201d Johnson added.",
      "Sanders on Sunday called Musk's comments \"totally outrageous,\" during an interview on \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "\"I think what Musk, the wealthiest guy in the world, just said is totally outrageous,\" he said.",
      "\"That's a hell of a 'Ponzi scheme,'\" Sanders said, referring to what Musk called Social Security on Friday, \"When for the last 80 years, Social Security has paid out every nickel owed to every eligible American.\""

    "story": [
      "SpaceX plans to launch its Starship megarocket on its next test flight on Monday, roughly six weeks after the vehicle\u2019s upper stage blew up over the Atlantic Ocean during the last such test.",
      "In that mishap on Jan. 16, SpaceX lost communication with Starship about eight minutes into the flight, and the vehicle\u2019s subsequent explosion sent debris streaking through the sky. Dust and small pieces rained over parts of Turks and Caicos, but local authorities said there were no injuries.",
      "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration launched an investigation after the accident and grounded the rocket during the probe. On Friday, the agency cleared Starship to return to flight but said its investigation remains open.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s own investigation found that the likely root cause was leaking propellant in a section of Starship known as the \u201cattic,\u201d which is located between the bottom of the liquid oxygen tank and the rear heat shield.",
      "The leak likely sparked \u201csustained fires\u201d that eventually caused \u201call but one of Starship\u2019s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences,\u201d SpaceX said in an update on Monday.",
      "The company said it stopped receiving data just over eight minutes into the test flight, and that the vehicle broke apart three minutes after that.",
      "SpaceX said it has since made \u201cseveral hardware and operational changes\u201d to Starship\u2019s upper stage, but the company did not specify what those upgrades were.",
      "The upcoming test flight, Starship\u2019s eighth, was originally scheduled for Friday; no explanation was provided for the short delay.",
      "The FAA, which signed off on the flight, is one of many federal agencies that the Trump administration has targeted for budget and personnel cuts. Reuters reported that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, has infiltrated FAA facilities and that SpaceX engineers have been working at the agency as special government employees.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether DOGE employees have had a presence within the FAA\u2019s commercial spaceflight division, which oversees private companies like SpaceX, but some lawmakers and critics, including Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., have nonetheless raised concerns about Musk\u2019s conflicts of interest.",
      "If Starship launches as intended on Monday, it will attempt to release four mock Starlink satellites during the flight. If successful, that would mark the first time the vehicle has deployed a payload.",
      "The plan also calls for the megarocket\u2019s hulking first stage to return to the launchpad after separating from the second stage, and for SpaceX to \u201ccatch\u201d it there using giant mechanical arms on the rocket\u2019s launch tower. SpaceX completed that part as intended during the January flight, leading the company to deem the test a partial success.",
      "The catch maneuver is a key part of SpaceX\u2019s goal to make Starship a fully reusable rocket system.",

      "Starship is the most powerful rocket ever developed, measuring 400 feet tall. The system has two parts: a first-stage booster known as Super Heavy and an upper-stage spacecraft.",
      "It is expected to play a crucial part in NASA\u2019s efforts to return to the moon. The agency selected SpaceX to carry astronauts to the lunar surface during NASA\u2019s planned Artemis III mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2027.

    "story": [
      "A budget resolution adopted Tuesday by House Republicans could jeopardize the health insurance coverage of millions of low-income and disabled people who rely on Medicaid if lawmakers follow through with their proposed spending cuts, experts warn.",
      "The budget plan instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, to identify at least $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts over the next 10 years. The savings are expected to be used to extend President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of this year.",
      "While the resolution doesn\u2019t specifically mention Medicaid, experts say it would be unfeasible for Republicans to hit that target without significant cuts to the health program, since it\u2019s one of the largest sources of federal spending, costing more than $600 billion per year, according to government data.",
      "\u201cThe way the math would work is that those cuts would largely need to come out of Medicaid,\u201d said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a nonprofit group that focuses on health policy. \u201cMedicare is off the table, and there just aren\u2019t any other sources of funding for the Energy Commerce to look at.\u201d (During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to preserve Medicare.)",
      "The possible cuts are expected to extend beyond those who benefited from the 2014 Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, potentially affecting nearly all of the people in the program.",
      "\u201cEveryone who relies on Medicaid would be at risk,\u201d said Edwin Park, a research professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 \u201cSpecifics of the proposal will matter \u2014 each state will be hit, and how hard they\u2019ll be hit will vary \u2014 but certainly they\u2019re all at risk.\u201d",
      "Who does Medicaid cover?",
      "Medicaid provides health insurance primarily to people with low incomes, although it covers other groups including some older adults, pregnant women and people with disabilities. That includes about 72 million people.",
      "In 2023, Medicaid covered nearly 4 in 10 children, including over 8 in 10 children in poverty, 1 in 6 adults, and almost half of adults in poverty, according to KFF. The program covers more than 1 in 4 adults with disabilities and provides coverage for 41% of all births in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Medicare and Social Security are sort of these sacrosanct programs and Medicaid is often not lumped into the category,\u201d said Allison Orris, the director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank. \u201cPolling over the last few years shows that two- thirds of adults in the U.S. have some connection to Medicaid, and almost three- quarters of the population have a generally favorable view of the program. And that\u2019s because Medicaid really touches people and provides health care at all stages of life.\u201d",
      "The program is jointly funded by states and the federal government. States cover the upfront cost of care and then are reimbursed by the federal government for at least 50%.",
      "When the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to more people, the federal government committed to paying at least 90% of the total costs for the people who enrolled due to the expansion in each state.",
      "The share of people on Medicaid varies by state, but the states with the highest number of enrollees include California, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and New York, according to KFF. The program covers nearly half of Puerto Rico residents, the largest share among states and territories. Only 10 states, including Florida and Texas, don\u2019t participate in Medicaid\u2019s expansion.",
      "With fewer dollars coming from the federal government, states would bear a larger share of Medicaid costs, which many would likely struggle to afford, Orris said.",
      "\u201cCapping federal spending doesn\u2019t make health care needs go away,\u201d Orris said. \u201cIt just shifts the risk of higher spending to states and makes states make choices about: do they cut coverage, do they cut eligibility, do they cut provider rates?\u201d",
      "What about fraud in Medicaid?",
      "The GOP House budget plan is only the first step in a series of negotiations between House and Senate lawmakers before a bill can reach Trump\u2019s desk.",
      "Republican leaders have argued that the proposed budget cuts would eliminate fraud in Medicaid, but Park, of Georgetown, said there\u2019s no data to support the claim that fraud is more prevalent in Medicaid than in other parts of the health care system, including Medicare and private insurance.",
      "On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on CNN that lawmakers were not going to make cuts to Medicaid benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of those who are rightful beneficiaries of the program,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut the fraud, waste and abuse and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get the savings to accomplish this mission.\u201d",
      "Park said that\u2019s misleading.",
      "\u201cThe fraud argument is being used as a frame to justify Medicaid cuts, but the major proposals that are under consideration today to achieve this $880 billion target are the same major Medicaid cuts that were included in the [2017] Affordable Care Act repeal and replace bills that ultimately failed,\u201d Park said. \u201cBack then, there was no talk about combating fraud or waste or abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to hurt enrollees, we\u2019re not going to hurt people, we\u2019re just going to deal with waste, fraud and abuse,\u2019\u201d Orris said. \u201cBut I think we need to unpack that and understand that just like any health care program, there are some improper payments in Medicaid, which generally result from paperwork not being filled out. That happens across all programs.\u201d",
      "The argument, experts say, shifts the focus away from the harms that would come to people across age and income spectrum if Medicaid gets cuts.",
      "\u201cCongress is very unlikely to say, \u2018Dear states, you need to cut coverage for people with disabilities,\u2019\u201d Orris said. \u201cAll of those hard decisions are going to be left for states to make and it\u2019s hard to say that any population would be spared, especially if you get into the realms of cuts that are big enough that lead to hospitals closing and impacting access to care.\u201d",
      "Without Medicaid coverage, people often don\u2019t have any other options.",
      "\u201cMedicaid is such a complicated program, and it covers so many different facets of the health care system, many of which people don\u2019t fully appreciate,\u201d Rudowitz said. \u201cWe know that most people who lose Medicaid would likely become uninsured and then would still need health care services, and may still show up to clinics, and those providers would likely not be reimbursed.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The overhaul of South Carolina\u2019s death chamber was completed three years ago. Now, a team of sharpshooters is practicing its aim for what is poised to be the first firing squad execution in the state\u2019s history on Friday.",
      "Death by firing squad remains an extremely uncommon form of capital punishment in the United States, with only three carried out since the death penalty was ruled constitutional in 1976. All three occurred in Utah \u2014 the last in 2010, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Brad Sigmon, the condemned South Carolina prisoner, opted for firing squad over the state\u2019s primary method of electrocution or the more widely used practice of lethal injection.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s made the best choice that he can, but the fact that he had to make it at all is horrifying,\u201d said Sigmon\u2019s lawyer, Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King.",
      "Sigmon, 67, who was convicted in 2002 in the beating deaths of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s parents, declined lethal injection, King said, because of concerns over its use in the last three executions in South Carolina.",
      "In a filing last week asking the South Carolina Supreme Court to halt Sigmon\u2019s execution, his legal team noted the state\u2019s autopsy report for Marion Bowman Jr., who was put to death by lethal injection last month, indicates he was given \u201c10 grams of pentobarbital\u201d and \u201cdied with his lungs massively swollen with blood and fluid,\u201d akin to \u201cdrowning.\u201d",
      "That amount of pentobarbital is double what corrections officials had attested to needing under the state\u2019s lethal injection protocol, according to the filing.",
      "King argued that the state must disclose more information about the protocol and the quality of its pentobarbital on hand in order for Sigmon to have made a fair choice.",
      "State prosecutors said in a response Friday to Sigmon\u2019s filing that because he chose death by firing squad, he has \u201cwaived any argument about lethal injection.\u201d They also contend the second dose of pentobarbital was administered as outlined under the state\u2019s protocol and nothing was unusual with how the other inmates died.",
      "With Sigmon\u2019s execution drawing closer, barring a last-minute reprieve, the return of a firing squad execution is also raising questions about whether it is ushering a new \u2014 yet old \u2014 chapter in America\u2019s use of the death penalty.",
      "During the Civil War, firing squads were common for executing soldiers for desertion; in some cases, they would be blindfolded and tied to stakes before being shot. A century ago, Nevada executed a prisoner using an automated machine that fired the bullets so that no person had to.",
      "In the modern era of capital punishment, only a handful of states, including Mississippi and Oklahoma, allow for the method, with South Carolina legalizing it in 2021 and Idaho following two years later amid a nationwide shortage of lethal injection drugs.",
      "Corinna Barrett Lain, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said states are moving to the firing squad because lethal injection has been problematic, with reports of \u201cbotched\u201d incidents in recent years.",
      "\u201cStates can\u2019t get the drugs. They can\u2019t get qualified medical professionals to do it,\u201d Lain, the author of the upcoming book \u201cSecrets of the Killing State: The Untold Story of Lethal Injection,\u201d said in an email.",
      "\u201cThe firing squad is too honest, too explicit about what the death penalty is. People tend to think it\u2019s barbaric and archaic,\u201d Lain said, adding: \u201cIn that way, it may start some very important, and long overdue conversations about the death penalty in this country.\u201d",
      "Utah\u2019s use of the firing squad",
      "The last firing squad execution, in 2010, lasted about four minutes, from when the death chamber\u2019s curtain was lifted to when the bullets struck Utah inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner, according to media witnesses.",
      "Gardner, 49, was sentenced to death after fatally shooting an attorney, Michael Burdell, and wounding a bailiff, George Kirk, as he attempted to flee a courthouse in 1985. Gardner was already in custody for the killing of a bartender, Melvyn John Otterstrom, a year earlier.",
      "Prison staff members strapped Gardner to a chair, and after he declined to make a final statement, fit a black hood over his head. A small white target with a bull\u2019s-eye pattern was fastened to his chest. Five shooters \u2014 volunteers described as certified police officers \u2014 fired .30-caliber Winchester rifles from behind a wall with a gun port.",
      "The number of shooters helped to ensure one of the bullets was fatal, although one firearm was also fed a blank so that each shooter was uncertain who was directly responsible for the death, officials said.",
      "Media witnesses described Gardner appearing to flinch and move his arm after being shot, leaving them to wonder if he was still alive and would have to be shot again. But a medical examiner declared him dead a short time later, they said.",
      "Jennifer Dobner, who covered the execution for The Associated Press, said it was a \u201cvery clinical and precise procedure.\u201d Fifteen years later, she still recalls a \u201cboom, boom\u201d from the rapid gunfire, then \u201cthe target on his chest kind of blew up, the fabric kind of blew up,\u201d and the room fell silent. The execution was traumatic for the Gardner family, she said.",
      "\u201cThey have their own trauma from losing their brother this way. Not that they condone anything that he did, but it is a very extreme form of punishment,\u201d Dobner said.",
      "Jamie Stewart, Kirk\u2019s granddaughter, witnessed Gardner\u2019s execution with her grandmother. Kirk died a decade after the shooting.",
      "Stewart said she initially thought the execution was going to be more gruesome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s over really quick,\u201d Stewart said in a text. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything like I expected it to be.\u201d",
      "To her, it was \u201cthe most humane\u201d way for Gardner to die, she said. \u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s horrible to die this way, but how many botched firing squad executions have there been?\u201d",
      "Gardner\u2019s death \u201cgave me closure,\u201d she added. \u201cThat monster finally paid for his crimes.\u201d",
      "Gardner\u2019s brother Randy Gardner said none of his family witnessed the execution but he has since become an advocate against the death penalty.",
      "The method of his brother\u2019s death has haunted him, he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve gone through years and years of nightmares of me executing my mother in a wheelchair and executing my kids and my kids executing me,\u201d Randy Gardner said. \u201cAnd, you know, after six, seven, eight years of that, I finally had to get a therapist.\u201d",
      "Randy Gardner later saw his brother\u2019s body and also received graphic autopsy photos showing the extent of the wounds. His socks were soaked red from the blood.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty in South Carolina,\u201d Randy Gardner said.",
      "What is planned in South Carolina",
      "At the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia, the shooters are volunteers employed by the Department of Corrections. Per officials, the three-person squad will fire rifles, all with live ammunition, from behind a wall about 15 feet from the inmate, who will be seated.",
      "Before the shooting, the inmate is allowed to make a last statement, then a hood is placed over his head and a target pinned over his heart. Bullet-resistant glass separates the chamber from another room where witnesses, including media, will be permitted.",
      "The department provides mental health support to staff members who are taking part in executions, said spokeswoman Chrysti Shain.",
      "D\u2019Michelle DuPre, a forensic consultant in South Carolina and a former medical examiner, said \u201cbotched\u201d firing squad executions can be prevented as long as the shooters are properly trained.",
      "\u201cWhen your heart is struck with a bullet like this, you\u2019re immediately incapacitated,\u201d DuPre said. \u201cThere\u2019s relatively no pain. Everything is very quick.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the heart is destroyed, it can\u2019t pump blood to your brain, and the brain is what keeps you conscious,\u201d she said. Muscles may still contract, she added, but \u201cit\u2019s not a sign of life.\u201d",
      "King said Sigmon has spent the past two decades in prison repenting, reading the Bible and praying.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very devout, and that\u2019s been the organizing principle of his life ever since he went to death row,\u201d King said. \u201cSo he\u2019s continued on that course. He is, I would say, fearful about what is looming.\u201d",
      "The execution chamber is located beside death row, and King said inmates \u201chave been treated to the unsettling experience of hearing a lot of gunfire.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just folks practicing on the firing range, which is also very close to the row,\u201d he added, \u201cor whether they\u2019re practicing for an execution.\u201d"

      "This year\u2019s Oscars race has been one for the books. It\u2019s been a time to recognize the work of some of Hollywood\u2019s finest and to celebrate first-time and historic nominations.",
      "But it seems that amid this history-making season, there\u2019s been an equal amount of controversies. Many of the best picture nominees have been mired in headlines that have nothing to do with the movie.",
      "Here's what to know about the Oscars race we can't look away from.",
      "All the ways the 2025 Oscars movies faced controversy",
      "One movie takes the award for most-nominated \u2014 and most controversial. Netflix's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d officially holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for a non-English language film.",
      "Garnering 13 nods, including ones for best picture, best director, best actress and supporting actress for Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Zoe Salda\u00f1a, respectively, the film beat out previous record holders such as \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u201d (2000) and \u201cRoma\u201d (2018).",
      "The Spanish-language musical crime thriller, written and directed by Jacques Audiard, follows a criminal defense attorney (Salda\u00f1a) who helps a Mexican cartel leader (Gasc\u00f3n) disappear so he can transition into a woman.",
      "While there were some mixed reactions to the film, including GLAAD, who called it \u201ca step backward for trans representation,\u201d the film received mostly positive reviews from critics, including the New York Times, which said Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s performance added \u201csoul to the melodrama.\u201d",
      "But in late January, less than three months after its release, Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s rise as an award show favorite was quickly halted after a journalist shared some of her past tweets online, which many deemed offensive. Following the backlash, the actor issued an apology through Netflix and gave an interview to CNN Espa\u00f1ol Feb. 2, addressing her past comments and noting that she used her social media \u201cmore like a diary\u201d than as a platform with influence. Some felt that the actor didn\u2019t take full accountability for her actions, including the film's director, who told Deadline Feb. 5 that Gasc\u00f3n was \u201cself-destructive\u201d and needed \u201cspace to reflect and take accountability for her actions.\u201d",
      "While Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s past tweets and her recent responses to the backlash have cast a shadow over the film and her buzz-worthy portrayal, the actor\u2019s indiscretions weren\u2019t the only thing about \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d that have caused controversy.",
      "Some viewers have questioned why Audiard, a French man who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, served as director. Others, like Mexican actor and singer Mauricio Mart\u00ednez, criticized the director\u2019s self-admitted lack of research about the country and its people while making the film.",
      "Other criticisms surrounding the film included the perceived dismissal of Mexican culture by not casting Mexican actors in most of the lead roles and Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish language skills, among other issues pointed out by viewers.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n isn\u2019t the only first-time best actress nominee that has caught flak for past or recent behavior. \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d Oscar nominee Fernanda Torres, who plays a mother coping with the disappearance of her politician husband, also recently made headlines after a 2008 clip of her in blackface resurfaced online.",
      "In a statement to Deadline Jan. 26, Torres apologized for appearing in blackface, saying she was \u201cvery sorry\u201d and that at the time \u201cthe awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn\u2019t yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil.\u201d The actor\u2019s apology followed her best actress Golden Globe win in early January and her best actress Oscar nod, which made her the second Brazilian actress (after her mom, Fernanda Montenegro) to ever be nominated for that award. If she wins, she would make history as the first Brazilian actress to take home that Oscar.",
      "\"Anora\" had a controversy of its own. First-time Oscar nominee Mikey Madison, who plays a stripper who falls for the son of a Russian oligarch, received backlash after her comments for her decision not to use an intimacy coordinator on set.",
      "\u201cIt was a choice that I made,\u201d Madison said in a conversation with Pamela Anderson for Variety\u2018s Actors on Actors. The actor said she was offered the option of an intimacy coordinator by the film\u2019s director, Sean Baker, and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, but she and her co-star, Mark Eydelshteyn, \u201cdecided that it would be best just to keep it small. We were able to streamline it, shoot it super quickly.\u201d",
      "Some fans online took issue with an intimacy coordinator being a choice and not a \u201cmandatory requirement\u201d on set, while others felt her comments could \u201clead to other directors thinking intimacy coordinators aren\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Baker had previously told Variety that keeping \u201cactors safe, protected, comfortable and involved in the process\u201d was his team\u2019s No. 1 priority on set, but still some argued that Madison was \u201cmanipulated\u201d into not using one.",
      "It\u2019s not just films with best actress nominees that have been put through wringer this award show season. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which landed 10 Oscar nominations, including a best actor nod for its star Adrien Brody, has sparked a slew of backlash for its use of artificial intelligence.",
      "The movie, which follows a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who struggles in the U.S. until a wealthy client recognizes his talent as a visionary architect, used AI to digitally alter the Hungarian accents of actors Brody and Felicity Jones, neither of whom speaks Hungarian natively. Though the film\u2019s director, Brady Corbet, went on to defend his use of AI in the movie in a statement to Deadline, some fans said the use of the technology diminished the film\u2019s \u201cauthenticity.\u201d",
      "Another major contender, \u201cConclave,\u201d which received a best picture and best actor nomination for Ralph Fiennes, caused a bit of a stir among Catholics. Centering around scandals and power struggles within a fictional papal conclave, the film ignited a holy, or rather unholy, debate about the film being \u201canti-Catholic propaganda,\u201d as some Catholic publications put it.",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, the bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, shared his criticism of the film on X, calling it an \u201cirredeemable situation\u201d and advising others to \u201crun away from it as fast as you can.\u201d His sentiments, which were viewed over one million times, were also reflected by various conservative commentators who said Catholics should be upset with the film.",
      "Then, just as some of the online chatter about the controversies surrounding this year\u2019s nominated projects appeared to quiet down ahead of the award show on March 2, a new controversy concerning \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d director Ali Abbasi emerged just days after Oscar voting ended on Feb. 18.",
      "After multiple outlets reported that Abbasi was dropped by his talent agency and management after an alleged groping incident that reportedly happened at a Golden Globes party, Abbasi took to X to address the reports and apologize for his actions.",
      "\u201cI made an over-familiar gesture \u2014 a slap on the rear \u2014 which I intended as playful and not in any sexual way whatsoever,\u201d he wrote in part. \u201cI quickly realized I had misjudged the situation. I apologized to him on the spot, and the following day I made sure my apology was reiterated through my representatives.\u201d",
      "He also refuted reports that he was \u201cdropped\u201d by his representation \u201cdue to this interaction.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy decision to part ways was a long-term career decision that was not shaped by short motivations. I believe in taking accountability for my actions; I made a mistake, I apologized and have learned a valuable life lesson,\u201d he added.",
      "Abbasi\u2019s film, which follows Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power as a real estate mogul in the \u201880s under the mentorship of lawyer Roy Cohn, landed two Oscar nods, one for Sebastian Stan as Trump and one for Jeremy Strong, who portrayed Cohn.",
      "How the 2025 Oscars also were a landmark for history-making representation",
      "Amid the onslaught of controversies, there\u2019s a silver lining to the Oscars this year: there\u2019s a big opportunity for some major history to be made.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n became the first openly trans actress to receive an Oscar nomination. This year also marks the first time four Latino performers were nominated in Oscar acting categories \u2014 Gasc\u00f3n, Salda\u00f1a, Torres, and Colman Domingo.",
      "Domingo, who was nominated for his portrayal of Bayard Rustin in \u201cRustin\u201d last year, also has an opportunity to become the first Afro-Latino to win the best actor Oscar for his performance in \u201cSing Sing,\u201d a prison-drama that follows incarcerated men who take part in a theater arts rehabilitation program.",
      "Meanwhile, Cynthia Erivo, nominated for her portrayal of Elphaba in \u201cWicked,\u201d has the potential to become the youngest EGOT winner, or winner of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.",
      "She already has a 2016 Tony for her role as Celie in Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d a 2017 Grammy for best musical theater album for \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and a 2017 Daytime Emmy for her performance on TODAY with the cast of \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d",
      "The film, which follows the complicated friendship of two witches, marks the third time Erivo has had a shot at the coveted honor; she received a best actress Oscar nod for \u201cHarriet\u201d in 2020 and another nod for best original song for \u201cStand Up\u201d from the same film.",
      "While it's uncertain if Erivo will take home the Oscar on Sunday night, the singer talked about the tough lessons she's learned along the way during her acceptance speech at the Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards on Feb. 27. She compared her journey to Elphaba's and encouraged the audience \u2014 filled with Black women \u2014 to recognize their value regardless if others acknowledged or honored them for it.",
      "\"Elphaba's journey as a woman seen as different and cast aside for the very thing that makes her unique speaks to the heart of every Black woman who has ever been judged and misunderstood and yet still learned that her power was a gift or love,\" Erivo said. \"So I thought that I, Cynthia, would speak to your hearts. I wanted to take this opportunity as more than an opportunity to accept this beautiful award and honor, and I wanted to use it as a way to affirm you all.\"",
      "She continued, \"You weren't insane when you were dreaming of being a superhero. You weren't asking too much when you wanted to be seen for the lead. When you were little and you believed you could fly, that wasn't a fairy tale.

      "\u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, who play Glinda and Elphaba in the movie adaptation of the musical, are set to perform at the 97th Annual Academy Awards on March 2.",
      "The duo has not shared exactly what they plan to perform, but \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d the defining anthem of the musical, is a likely contender.",
      "Since the moment the musical opened on Broadway over 20 years ago, \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d has proven a favorite among theater-lovers across the globe.",
      "The release of the movie adaptation of \u201cWicked\u201d last November, and the use of the song in its promotional materials, bolstered the popularity of \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d even further.",
      "\u201cDefying Gravity\u201d also inadvertently shaped one of the press tour\u2019s viral moments. Tracy E. Gilchrist, a reporter for Out, told Grande and Erivo that people in the LGBTQ+ community are \u201ctaking the lyrics of \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019 and really holding space with that.\u201d In response, Grande grasped Erivo\u2019s finger and Erivo issued an earnest answer. The internet, meanwhile, tried to understand what it all meant.",
      "Read on for the meaning and significance of \u201cWicked\u2019s\u201d eminent song, \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d",
      "What happens during \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019?",
      "\u201cDefying Gravity\u201d is the Act I finale of \u201cWicked\u201d in the stage musical and the ending of the movie \u201cWicked,\u201d which is the first of two films.",
      "\u201cWe found it very difficult to get past \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019 without a break,\u201d Schwartz said in a fan newsletter. \u201cThat song is written specifically to bring a curtain down, and whatever scene to follow it without a break just seemed hugely anti-climactic.\u201d",
      "Within \u201cWicked\u2019s\u201d storyline, \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d marks Elphaba\u2019s reaction to discovering the Wizard of Oz does not actually have the magical powers that he claims to hold.",
      "Elphaba goes to the Emerald City under the pretense that she could harness her powers and train alongside the Wizard, and maybe even get his help in removing her green skin tone.",
      "Right before \"Defying Gravity,\" Elphaba learns that the Wizard and her Shiz University professor Madame Morrible only wanted to use her powers to carry out their sinister plan to strip the animals in Oz of their autonomy and rights.",
      "Elphaba, in response, flees. Glinda, following Morrible\u2019s orders, chases her in an attempt to convince Elphaba to go along with the plan.",
      "The song marks a pivotal turning point in Glinda and Elphaba\u2019s friendship. Their philosophical differences and approaches to working with the Wizard mean there is no going back to the way things were. From here on out, there is a divide between Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "Glinda sarcastically sings to Elphaba, \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy now.\u201d Elphaba\u2019s decision not to comply with Morrible and Oz means that she will likely be arrested by one of the guards swarming them \u2014 unless she can somehow escape.",
      "Elphaba retorts back, \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy too / I hope you\u2019re proud how you would grovel in submission / To feed your own ambition.\u201d In these words, she describes her disappointment with Glinda\u2019s choice to side with Morrible and Oz.",
      "Elphaba realizes she does not want to go along with what others want her to do, unlike Glinda, who so clearly does. After trying to change herself for so long, Elphaba embraces her individuality, green skin and all.\u00a0She lives by her own rules.",
      "For a moment, she appears to persuade Glinda to support her efforts. Together, they sing, \u201cThere\u2019s no fight we cannot win / just you and I defying gravity,\u201d they decide.",
      "By the end of the number, the idea of defying gravity becomes more than a metaphor. Elphaba mounts a broomstick and uses the magic she now celebrates to literally defy gravity and fly into the sky.",
      "Glinda has the option to join her in the sky, but ultimately decides not to mount the broom \u2013 choosing, perhaps, to be \"popular\" instead.",
      "Elphaba continues the song until the end of the film, relishing in her newfound individuality \u2014 the very thing that will earn the label of \"wicked.\"",
      "So, what is \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019 really about?",
      "\u201cDefying Gravity\u201d is about a lot of things. It's about Elphaba's empowerment and commitment to her principles in the face of an authoritarian regime. It's about the magic of unlocking personal power (or, in this case, the ability to fly).",
      "But Elphaba's triumph is undercut by a sense of bittersweetness: Her decision also separates her from her true friend.",
      "The song likely resonates with audiences because it inspires listeners to be unapologetically themselves and question, if not outright defy, social norms.",
      "Within the bounds of \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d anyone who has ever been pinned \"the enemy\" deserves to \"a chance to fly.\" Anyone who has ever felt like an underdog might come out the winner.",
      "What has Erivo said about 'Defying Gravity'?",
      "Erivo shared with Out100 that she understands, and personally connects with, Elphaba when she sings \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about Elphaba as an \u2018other\u2019 without having it intrinsically linked to being a woman who walks through the world as a queer Black woman,\u201d Erivo said.",
      "\u201cImmediately I understood what it meant for people to look at you and see you as not beautiful, not acceptable, not any of those things, because I walked through the world like this,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd having to find a way to not necessarily be OK with it but be OK with yourself enough so that when other people put that on you, you can still move through it.\u201d",

      "The cartel kingpin recruits a lawyer, Rita (Zoe Salda\u00f1a), to help her fake her own death and secretly obtain gender-affirming care \u2014 and at last, her new, authentic self, Emilia P\u00e9rez, is born.",
      "However, Emilia cannot completely escape her violent origins, and when her wife, Jessi (Selena Gomez) comes back into the picture, past and present collide in tragic ways.",
      "Some critics and filmmakers have raved about the Spanish-language musical, with\u00a0Variety\u00a0calling the movie \u201cdazzling\u201d and director Michael Mann\u00a0calling it\u00a0a \u201ccontemporary masterpiece.\u201d",
      "However, at the start of awards season, viewers have criticized the movie for its lack of cultural authenticity.",
      "Some have asked why the movie, which is helmed by a French director, Jacques Audiard, was not filmed in Mexico despite being set there, and features no Mexican leads. Per the\u00a0Hollywood Reporter, most of the movie was filmed on a sound stage in Paris, save for five days of exterior shots in Mexico. Others have criticized the language skills of Gomez, who is not fluent in Spanish.",
      "And the movie\u2019s approach to transgender representation is considered, by some, \u201ca step backward,\u201d as\u00a0GLAAD\u00a0put it.",

As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain,\u201d she said in her statement, according to\u00a0NBC News. \u201cAll my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.\u201d",

The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust. And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It\u2019s as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable,\u201d he said.",

      "Director Audiard responded to criticism of his approach to the Spanish language in an interview with Deadline. \u201cI happen to enormously love the Spanish language,\u201d he said. He also said, \u201cSpanish is such a rich language that crosses borders. What\u2019s been said about my statement is actually exactly the opposite of what I think.\u201d",
      "Audiard also said the movie was not meant to be realistic and compared his vision to an opera.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never claimed that I wanted to make a realistic work. If I wanted to make a work that was particularly documented, then I would do a documentary, but then there would be no singing and dancing. For example, I read a review where it said that night markets in Mexico City don\u2019t have photocopiers. Well, in night markets in Mexico City, one also doesn\u2019t sing and dance. You have to accept that is part of the magic here. This is an opera, not a criticism of anything about Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "The movie is set in Mexico but most of the cast is not Mexican",

      "Paz defended the movie in an interview with\u00a0IndieWire.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard people saying it\u2019s offensive to Mexico. I really want to know why, because I didn\u2019t feel that way. And I have questioned some people that I trust, not just as artists but as people, and they don\u2019t feel that way, so I am trying to understand,\u201d Paz said, adding that she feels the movie\u2019s director is a \u201cgenius.\u201d",
      "In November, casting director\u00a0Carla Hool said during a SAG-AFTRA\u00a0panel she and her team \u201cdid a big search\u201d for actors across Mexico, the United States, Spain and \u201call Latin America\u201d but did not find any Mexican actors suitable for the main roles.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to keep it really authentic but at the end of the day, the best actors who embodied these characters are the ones that are right here,\u201d she said, gesturing to Gasc\u00f3n, Gomez and Salda\u00f1a on the panel beside her. \u201cSo we had to figure out how to adjust authenticity \u2026 with the accents, and them not necessarily being native Mexican.\u201d",

      "One\u00a0X user\u00a0called the film \u201cridiculous\u201d and said it was a \u201cEuropean movie with hollywood stars that pretend to be mexican, with harmful stereotypes.\u201d",
      "Another X user criticized the movie\u2019s lack of Mexican stars and called the film \u201ca parody, a mockery of Mexico.\u201d",
      "Mexican director and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto also questioned why the film did not include more Mexican people behind the camera.",
      "\u201cWhy not hire a Mexican production designer, costume designer, or at least some consultants?\u201d he said in a November\u00a0Deadline\u00a0interview. \u201cYes, they had dialogue coaches but I was offended that such a story was portrayed in a way that felt so inauthentic.\u201d",
      "He also said the film included mistakes that could have been avoided if more Mexican people were involved in the production.",
      "\u201cYou would never have a jail sign that read \u2018C\u00e1rcel,\u2019\u201d he said of a sign shown on a building in the movie. \u201cIt would be \u2018Penitenciaria.\u2019 It\u2019s just the details, and that shows me that nobody that knew was involved. And it didn\u2019t even matter. That was very troubling to me.\u201d",
      "Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish-language acting has been criticized",
      "Controversy arose over Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish language skills in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d\u00a0Gomez\u2019s character is Mexican and grew up in the U.S., with family there.",
      "Mexican actor and comedian Eugenio Derbez\u00a0made headlines in December\u00a0when he called Gomez\u2019s Spanish \u201cindefensible\u201d in a clip from the \u201cHablando de Cine Con\u201d podcast\u00a0shared on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI feel like she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying,\u201d host Gaby Meza also said on the podcast. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying, she can\u2019t give her acting any nuance.\u201d",
      "Gomez responded to these criticisms in a comment on the TikTok post.",
      "\u201cI understand where you are coming from..I\u2019m sorry I did the best I could with the time I was given,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Amid backlash, Derbez then issued an apology to the \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d star.",
      "\u201cDear Selena, I truly apologize for my careless comments \u2014 they are indefensible and go against everything I stand for,\u201d he wrote on\u00a0TikTok. \u201cAs Latinos, we should always support one another. There\u2019s no excuse. I was wrong, and I deeply admire your career and your heart.\u201d",
      "Gomez grew up speaking Spanish but \u201clost\u201d the language when she started taking mainly English-speaking acting jobs at age 7, she told\u00a0NPR\u00a0in November.",
      "She said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0at the Cannes Film Festival that she is \u201cnot as happy with what I feel like I could have done in Spanish,\u201d but said she hoped \u201cit doesn\u2019t hinder my performance.\u201d",
      "Some people have defended Gomez\u2019s use of Spanish in the film.",
      "Annie Abbott, a professor of Spanish at the University of Illinois, argued that the criticism of Gomez mirrors the judgment sometimes experienced by heritage speakers \u2014 i.e., people with a Latino cultural and familial background who are not formally fluent in Spanish \u2014 from native Spanish speakers.",
      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for\u00a0The Fulcrum.",
      "A 2023 study from the\u00a0Pew Research Center\u00a0found that 24% of U.S. Latino adults say they carry on a conversation in Spanish \u201ca little or not at all.\u201d",
      "According to the study, 54% of U.S. Latinos who say that only speak a little Spanish \u201csay another Hispanic person has made them feel bad for it.\u201d",
      "However, one commenter on X responding to Abbott argued that the issue wasn\u2019t with Gomez\u2019s language ability or identity, but with the fact that her Spanish skills did not match the demands of her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user\u00a0wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors\u2019 varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me. We had all these problems with accents, but we fixed them in the edit. We did a lot of dubbing.\u201d",
      "Some argue the movie perpetuates harmful trans stereotypes",
      "Some viewers have criticized the movie\u2019s depiction of trans people and the trans experience.",
      "GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy group formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,\u00a0called \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d\u00a0a \u201cstep backward for trans representation\u201d and said the film \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas\u2019 aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for\u00a0Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",
      "\u201cAny time Emilia \u2018reverts\u2019 to her \u2018old ways,\u2019 Gascon lowers her vocal register as if to equate masculinity with evil and femininity with good,\u201d Barquin wrote for\u00a0Little White Lies magazine.",
      "Reviewer David Opie echoed this criticism, pointing to a scene when Emilia throws her wife Jessi onto a bed \u201cand threatens her using the same low, masculine voice she used pre-surgery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if the so-called \u2018evil\u2019 in Emilia is a separate entity, the \u2018man\u2019 she was raised to be, rather than her being the same person going through a transitional journey,\u201d Opie wrote for\u00a0Yahoo! Movies.",
      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for\u00a0Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for\u00a0Out Front magazine\u00a0that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \u201cwas hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n herself has pushed back at people calling her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d"

Once he and Lauren returned to Minnesota, this dynamic caused friction in their relationship, especially since Dave's sister was worried that he'd end up with someone who appeared on \"Love Is Blind\" for the wrong reasons.",
      "While the couple was bowling one night, Lauren expressed her frustration with the influence Dave's sister's opinions had on him.",
      "\u201cI just feel bad cause my sister, she just didn\u2019t expect me to get this far or keep it going. I kind of led her to be like, \u2018It\u2019s not going to.\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018Why are you lying to me? Why don\u2019t you just tell me what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d he explained.",

      "But did his family want to meet her? Iffy, Dave said. \"My family, they don\u2019t meet just anyone. I don\u2019t want to waste her time either,\u201d Dave replied.",

      "\"That's not what I heard. You said, 'I should've ended it. I don't know why I didn't.' And this is where I'm having a hard time. It went from that to saying it really wasn't that serious. That's where my lack of trust is coming into play. I had to ask \u2014 you didn't tell me about it,\" Dave said.",
      "Lauren admitted that she \"hooked up\" with her recent romantic partner a week before filming \"Love Is Blind.\" She then addressed why this man was texting her when they returned from Honduras, saying he \"had a different interpretation of our time.\"",
      "\"Now I'm getting frustrated because on Sunday you literally said, 'I don't give a s--- about who you hooked up with before this.' And now we're coming back to it,\" she said.",
      "At this point, Dave brings up his off-camera meeting with Lauren's dad, who didn't want to be recorded.",
      "\"Yeah, we're coming back to it because of the way your dad approached me saying that he thought I was there just to see what happens and you were fully ready for this engagement, get married in six weeks deal,\" Dave replied.",
      "\"I don't understand why this is on my family when your sister didn't want you to get engaged. Your dad didn't even know that there was an engagement,\" Lauren replied.",
      "Eventually, the couple agreed that they had a strong connection but should go their separate ways.",
      "In a confessional interview, Dave said he felt like he \"let her down\" because he \"couldn't get over my own ego.\"",
      "\"Love is blind but I don't think marriage is,\" he said.",
      "In her own private interview, Lauren said, \"I'm really sad this didn't work out. I'm so incredibly sad about it. I'm also pissed that he let it get here.\"",
      "Lauren and Dave got closure at a group event",
      "In Episode 11, several Season 8 cast members got together. Dave and Lauren snuck away for a serious discussion during the event.",
      "Dave admitted that he's \"really bad at\" admitting that he's wrong.",
      "\"It just sucks and it's not you. That's the thing about all of this. It's not you. I'm so sick of having to try to defend you versus my friends versus my family. I don't care about that. It's my fault. My ego got in the way of really seeing what we had. I guess what I'm saying is I'm really sorry,\" he said.",
      "\"I have been giving 150% the last week to try to figure things out with you and you've not given me that ... You were giving me nothing. You were giving me no validation. You were not letting me in in any capacity,\" she replied.",
      "At the end of the conversation, Dave acknowledged that their love was \"real\" and admitted that that \"freaks him out.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry that you're going through all of the feels of this. I want to believe it so badly and a lot of me does. But it's just hard to believe. I think we're past that,\" she said.",

      "In interviews with People published as the season unfolded, Dave and Lauren stood by their perspectives.",
      "Dave said introducing Lauren to his family felt \"pointless\" in light of what he said came out about her dating history.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re really close friends of mine. And then obviously my sister. There was no way I was going to spin that in (Lauren\u2019s) favor unfortunately at the time,\" he said.",
      "Lauren said she \"stands by\" everything she told Dave. \"I think it was fair of him to question me. I don\u2019t think it was fair to not let me be part of the conversation or to not hear me out,\" she said."

      "It\u2019s no secret that an Oscar win, or even\u00a0nomination, can transform an actor or filmmaker\u2019s career.",
      "It\u2019s also no secret that Hollywood\u2019s most prestigious awards are handed out by \u201cthe Academy\u201d each year \u2014 but what exactly is the Academy, and how do its members decide who wins awards?",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about who chooses Oscar nominees and winners, and the Oscars voting process.",
      "Who is part of the Academy?",
      "More than 10,500 \u201cglobal film industry artists and leaders\u201d are members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, according to the Academy\u2019s\u00a0website.",
      "Members include actors, writers, directors, costume designers, makeup artists, producers and other film industry professionals.",

      "The Academy\u2019s\u00a0Board of Governors, which \u201cdirects the Academy\u2019s strategic vision,\u201d per is website, is also comprised of several notable industry professionals, including director Ava DuVernay in the directors branch and Rita Wilson in the actors branch.",
      "How do people join the Academy in the first place?",
      "It isn\u2019t possible to apply to the Academy, but industry members\u00a0can be sponsored\u00a0by two other Academy members. The Board of Governors makes the final decision on whether a sponsor gets an invitation for membership.",
      "All Oscar nominees, meanwhile, are automatically considered for membership in the Academy and do not need to be sponsored, per the\u00a0Academy\u2019s website.",

      "The Academy oversees other awards in addition to the Oscars: the Governors Awards, which highlight a handful of individuals\u2019 creative and humanitarian achievements, the Student Academy Awards, and the Scientific and Technical Awards.",
      "The voting process for Oscar nominations",
      "The voting process for the Oscars begins well before the nominations are announced. For the 97th Academy Awards, the submission deadline for general entry categories was in mid-November, and preliminary voting began on Dec. 9, 2024, according to the Academy\u2019s\u00a0website.",
      "A shortlist was announced later in December. The Academy members' voting period in January was extended twice due to the wildfires, Deadline reported.",
      "All Academy members are eligible to nominate films for best picture picture, but for most of the 24 Oscars categories, Academy members vote for nominees within their own field \u2014 so, actors nominate actors, editors nominate editors, and so forth.",
      "Best international feature film and best animated feature have specific nomination rules.",
      "In the case of the\u00a0international feature film\u00a0category, nominees are chosen via two rounds of voting, which all Academy members are invited to partake in. In the first round, members vote by secret ballot to create a shortlist of 15 nominees from the eligible submissions. Then, members vote again to narrow this list to five nominees. In this second round of voting, members are required to have seen all 15 films on the shortlist.",
      "Similarly, all members can also vote on the\u00a0best animated feature film.",
      "The 97th Academy Awards nominations were\u00a0announced in a live ceremony\u00a0on Jan. 23.",
      "Who votes for Oscar winners?",
      "In the final step, which is choosing winners,\u00a0all\u00a0voting members of the Academy can vote on\u00a0all\u00a0Oscar categories, per the\u00a0Academy\u2019s website.",
      "Final votes are conducted online, and the results are tabulated by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.",
      "How are Oscar winners decided?",
      "For most categories, the nominee with the most votes wins.",
      "It\u2019s a bit more complicated for best picture. Since 2009, the Academy has used ranked-choice voting system, or a preferential ballot, to determine best picture. The Oscars says this is the \u201cfairest possible\u201d outcome for nominations\u00a0in a video on its YouTube page. The\u00a0Hollywood Reporter\u00a0phrases it differently: \u201cThe point of it is to ensure that the best picture winner is the movie that is the most\u00a0widely\u00a0liked by the electorate.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s how it works. Voters rank the eligible films in order of their preference. If one film receives the majority of the top votes, it\u2019s automatically the winner. If no single nominee gets over 50% of the vote, the movie with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the voters who had\u00a0that\u00a0film as their number one have their votes count for their next choice.",
      "This process continues until one movie gets over 50% of the share.",
      "Only two partners at PwC know the results before they are announced live during the Oscars ceremony,\u00a0per the Academy\u2019s\u00a0website.",
      "Despite the rigorous protocols around selecting winners and guarding the results, human error can still bungle the process \u2014 just recall the\u00a0infamous flub at the 2017 Oscars, when \u201cLa La Land\u201d was mistakenly announced as the winner for Best Picture, instead of the actual winner, \u201cMoonlight.\u201d",
      "That night, an official from PwC accidentally handed presenter Warren Beatty the envelope containing the winner for best actress (Emma Stone for \u201cLa La Land\u201d)\u00a0instead of the best picture envelope, and after a moment of confusion, Beatty read out \u201cLa La Land\u201d as the Best Picture winner.",
      "\u201cOne of the most disappointing things to me was all the great work that had been done, not only last year but over the last 83 years, around accuracy, confidentiality (and) integrity of that process,\u201d PwC senior partner Tim Ryan told the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0in 2018. \u201cAnd where we got it wrong was on the handing over of the envelope.\u201d",
      "PwC, which helped build the digital system used for Oscars voting and also handles the Academy\u2019s taxes, according to the AP, said they were introducing new procedures and safeguards to ensure such an error couldn\u2019t happen again.",

      "In an essay she penned for Marie Claire in 2010, she recalled young Musk as \u201ca clean-cut, upper-class boy with a South African accent who appeared in front of me one afternoon as I was leaping up the steps to my dorm. He said we\u2019d met at a party I knew I hadn\u2019t been to. (Years later, he would confess that he had noticed me from across the common room and decided he wanted to meet me.)\u201d",

As the financial tech company\u2019s largest shareholder, Musk made $165 million from the deal, according to CNN Business. Meanwhile, his wife launched her own career as a dark fantasy author.",

In 2004, they welcomed twins, son Griffin and a child who later transitioned and now goes by her middle name, Jenna. And just two years after that, the Musk family added three more sons with the arrival of triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian.",

      "Toni Morrison was a giant in the literary world, both in her work as an author of Pulitzer Prize-winning tales and as a Random House editor bringing Black voices into publishing.",
      "To children\u2019s book author Andrea Davis Pinkney, Morrison was also a \u201cmentor, a guide, and a sister friend,\u201d she recalls in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "Now, Pinkney is honoring Morrison\u2019s legacy with an illustrated children\u2019s book about late novelist. \u201cAnd She Was Loved,\u201d which takes its title from a line in Morrison\u2019s \u201cSong of Solomon,\u201d was published Jan. 7.",
      "\u201cI want to pay the highest tribute to someone who meant so much to me, personally and professionally, who meant so much to so many other authors and emerging talent, and still does today,\u201d Pinkney says, describing the book as a \u201cpraise poem, a love letter, a thank you and an invitation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a full-circle moment for Pinkney, given how her relationship with Morrison began. The two collaborated on Morrison\u2019s books for children starting in 1991, where Pinkney had the formidable task of editing a literary icon.",
      "\u201cHaving grown up reading Toni Morrison as a child, being in a home where her books were everywhere, and then now working with her to create books for the next generation of readers \u2014 you can imagine how powerful and meaningful that was,\u201d Pinkney says.",
      "Pinkney was \u201ccompletely awestruck\u201d the first time she met Morrison, greeting her at the entrance of the publishing house and bringing her into the office. Morrison had a \u201cregal presence,\u201d Pinkney recalls.",
      "Unsure of what to say to her literary hero, Pinkney \u201cbabbled\u201d and tried to bond with Morrison through her daughter\u2019s name, Chloe \u2014 as Morrison was born Chloe Anthony Wofford Morrison.",
      "She was similarly nervous about actually editing Morrison's work. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what a tall order it is to edit the work of Toni Morrison. I would have a quivering pencil,\u201d she says.",
      "But the nerves and quivers subsided, Pinkney says, as the two women began their \u201cwholly collaborative\u201d relationship. \u201cThat had to go away so we could make some great books,\u201d she says.",
      "Morrison\u2019s approach to children\u2019s literature was similar to her works for adults, like \u201cBeloved\u201d and \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Pinkney says.",
      "\u201cToni Morrison was just a master storyteller and she was very committed to inviting young people into narratives. She wanted to reach out a hand and invite them in,\u201d she says.",
      "Pinkney says Morrison would handwrite her children\u2019s books, as she did her adult books. Periodically, Pinkney would receive installments via fax machine.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to embrace you and show you that you have worth. You have agency. You have dignity \u2014 you\u2019re never alone, because here we are.\u201d",
      "What Andrea Davis Pinkney says books told her as a child",
      "\u201cShe had a very curly, artistic, calligraphic handwriting, She would then call me and say, \u2018Andrea, go to the fax machine.\u2019 Out of the fax would come this waxy paper with her handwriting on it. We\u2019d line them up and like a beautiful mosaic, that is how the narratives for young people came together,\u201d she says.",
      "Their connection goes deeper than their working relationship. In Morrison, Pinkney found someone whose story arc echoed her own.",
      "Growing up, both women were integrated into their elementary schools and were the only Black students in their first grade classrooms. Pinkney describes the feeling of being the only Black student  in first grade as \u201canxious apartness,\u201d or the feeling that \u201cyou are completely alone in the world.\u201d",
      "During this time, Pinkney found solace in books and stories. \u201cThey said, \u2018Come. You belong here,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWe're here to embrace you and show you that you have worth. You have agency. You have dignity \u2014 you're never alone, because here we are.\u201d",
      "After working in publishing, Pinkney, like Morrison, became an author. She learned from Morrison to wake up early (very early \u2014 think 4 a.m.) to better convene with the \u201cmuse.\u201d",
      "She specializes in children's books, linking pivotal moments in history with beautiful illustration \u2014 often from her husband, award-winning illustrator\u00a0Brian Pinkney (though \"And She Was Loved\" was illustrated by Daniel Minter).",
      "Minter's artwork is a \u201cvisual ode\u201d to Morrison \u2014 and the covers tell a deliberate story about Morrison's philosophy.",
      "\u201cToni Morrison was committed to representing, rendering and celebrating Blackness,\u201d Pinkney says. \u201c(On the cover), she's looking right at us. When you peel off the case cover, there she is again. We, as a people, must always be front and center. We must show our faces. We must show up. We must look at you.\u201d",
      "With her book, Pinkney hopes to capture what Morrison provided for her readers and what books meant to Pinkney as a girl. \u201cThe title means everything to me. Toni Morrison left all of us that feeling of love,\u201d she says.",
      "It's fitting that Pinkney's last conversation with Morrison before her death in 2019 was about the importance of books for children.",
      "\u201cShe said something about the importance of giving young people enjoyment \u2014 lifting them up through the enjoyment of a story,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t just come in guns blazing going, \u2018We need to get engaged,\u2019\u201d Vanessa Lachey said of the cast. \u201cThey really pulled back the curtain, if you will, and peeled back the layers of themselves and the couples to really get down to it.\u201d",
      "Nick Lachey said this season's geographical location impacted the vibe of the cast and couples, too.",
      "\u201cMinnesota is totally Midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different pool of people here. So, every season\u2019s different. And I think what people will find in this particular season is that it\u2019s very, very ... I don\u2019t want to say\u00a0sweet, but it\u2019s more, it\u2019s more heartfelt.\u201d",

      "Devin and Virginia",
      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller hit it off in the pods after learning that they both attended the same Minnesota high school. But, Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, was a student at the school a few years after Virginia, a 34-year-old healthcare recruiter, graduated and the two had never crossed paths.",
      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "In Honduras, Virginia and Devin continued to get along but had a minor disagreement when they moved in together. After the couple visited their separate apartments and spoke about their future, Virginia suggested that they sign a prenup to establish financial boundaries. She explained that they should each be entitled to the assets they had before meeting each other. Devin was caught off guard and seemed hesitant to agree.",
      "When Devin introduced Virginia to his family, he mentioned the possible prenuptial agreement. His family, particularly his sister Kayla, questioned the idea and wondered if Virginia was already doubting if the marriage would work.",
      "Daniel and Taylor",
      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation. He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along. When she returned to gush with the girls, Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, said she appreciated that Daniel, a 30-year-old sales account executive, repeatedly spoke about searching for the mother of his kids.",
      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",
      "Taylor replied that Daniel made her feel \u201cvery special, very loved and very important.\u201d She then told Daniel that his words to her were the nicest things anyone has ever said to her.",
      "In Episode 6, he read her a letter explaining why he loved her. \u201cAll I want to do is make you feel safe and make you happy for the rest of your life,\u201d Daniel said. He then knelt on one knee and proposed.",
      "\u201cI would love to marry you!\u201d she cheered.",
      "Episode 6 ended on a cliffhanger as all the optimism and excitement Daniel and Taylor shared after meeting each other came to a screeching halt. After the face-to-face reveal, Taylor told the cameras she had an eerie feeling that she recognized Daniel. She spiraled, recalling that a social media user who looked like Daniel briefly followed her on Instagram before she left to film the show.",
      "She met Daniel and voiced her concerns, explaining that she worried he already knew facts based on her profile and used the prior knowledge to woo her. He said he couldn't remember following her and that her description didn't exactly match his account. To confirm the truth, she scrolled through a list of Instagram users who had previously followed her. When she couldn't find his name, she apologized. He was understanding and said he still wanted to take the trip with her Honduras.",
      "The two quickly moved past the tiff and enjoyed their vacation in Honduras. After they returned, they met each other's families and gushed about their connection. Daniel also introduced his parents to Taylor's mom and dad, who stressed that divorce wasn't an option in their family.",
      "Joey and Monica",
      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",
      "\u201cWould you get engaged with me?\u201d he asked.",

      "Joey and Monica spent their time in Honduras learning more about each other and their idiosyncrasies, like her family's shared \"sock bin.\" It appeared the two would have a drama-free path to the finale \u2014 until Joey met Monica's family.",
      "While her parents were welcoming and invited Joey to participate in their family jam session, Monica's older sister, Nicolle, quietly eyed Joey from her seat. When she pulled Monica to have a private conversation outside, Nicolle mentioned that Joey wasn't her sister's usual type. She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",
      "At their apartment, Joey shared that he could tell Nicolle didn't warm to him. After Monica revealed what she spoke about with Nicolle, Joey suggested that jealousy might be the cause of Nicolle's disapproval.",
      "Nicolle later takes Joey and Monica's engagement photos and appears to come around.",
      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "In Episode 10, the couple meets Sara's sister and her partner, who express worry and skepticism over her sister's new relationship.",
      "\u201cI see that you have a strong connection, but this is not real right now,\u201d Lisa, Sara's sister, told her.",
      "Sara appears to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",
      "Season 8 couples who are no longer together",
      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",
      "Despite Lauren\u2019s friends also supporting her, Dave could not fully trust Lauren, creating a strain in their relationship as they approached wedding day.",
      "The couple broke up in Episode 11 of the series in a long conversation that covered her past fling \u2014 which they still didn't share an understanding of \u2014 and Dave's talk with her father.",
      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",
      "Lauren, meanwhile, was \"really sad\" it didn't work out \u2014 and \"pissed,\" too. The former couple met after a group hangout but did not reconcile.",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",

      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",

      "One of the many personal photos she shared in a carousel simply showed can of Spam ornament hanging from some garland. The significance is that Slater was starring in \u201cSpamalot\u201d on Broadway while filming on \u201cWicked\u201d took a break in the wake of the SAG-AFTRA strike.",

Some critics had been especially hard on Slater, given that he and his ex-wife had welcomed a child just months before their split.",
      "\u201cThe most disappointing part was to see so many people believe the worst version of it,\u201d Grande said. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him \u2026\u201d",
      "The two-time Grammy winner went on to defend him, noting, \u201cNo one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about.

    "summary": "What are books by Black authors that have been banned? Read on for a list of banned books, why they were banned and what the authors have said.",
    "story": [
      "Book banning has increased across the country in recent years, according to data from two organizations dedicated to advocacy against censorship, but the practice of book banning in the United States dates back to the 1600s.",
      "The first known banned book was Thomas Morton's \"New English Canaan,\" a book published in 1637 that was banned by the Puritan government for its criticisms of their customs, according to a research guide from Harvard Graduate School of Education's Gutman Library. Outright bans enacted by the American government continued in the 1870s with the federal Comstock Act, which banned the distribution of writings that were \u201cobscene, lewd, or lascivious\u201d on the grounds of ensuring public morality.",
      "Today, book banning typically refers to the practice of removing or limiting access to materials from school or public libraries.",
      "Between 2022 and 2023, the American Library Association (ALA), a nonprofit that promotes the value of the library and librarians to the public, reported a 65% increase in the number of titles that were challenged for removal, marking a record high ever documented by the association.",
      "The trend has continued. From January to August 2024, the ALA tracked 414 attempts to limit access to more than 1,000 unique titles. PEN America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to free expression, meanwhile, reported more than 10,000 instances of book bans for the 2023-2024 school year.",
      "Book banning doesn\u2019t involve making materials completely unavailable for public consumption. Court cases have held that the First Amendment protects a \u201cright to receive information.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re saying that a book is being challenged in a community, and if the decision is made by the board to remove it, then they\u2019re saying that that\u2019s a ban on accessing that material through that library. But that doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s the only way that someone can access information,\u201d ALA President Cindy Hohl says.",
      "According to the ALA, a book ban occurs when material is removed from a library after a person or group objects to it. A ban is often initiated by a challenge, which refers to the attempt to remove it from public access.",
      "PEN America takes a broader approach, defining a school book ban as any action that results in access to a book being \"restricted or diminished, either temporarily or permanently.\"",
      "What both organizations share is the goal of tracking where access to books is being disrupted \u2014 a task that's easier said than done.",
      "\"We rely upon libraries and library professionals to report these matters directly to ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom,\" Hohl says. \"So we believe that there is a matter of under-reporting because many of the book challenges aren't even submitted to us or covered by the press.",
      "We continue to see this trend where (book bans are) specifically targeting Black, Indigenous, people of color, whether it's the author themselves, or it's the characters in the storyline... Who has the right to decide whose voice should have a place in American literature?",
      "cindy hohl",
      "\"When we look at the data that's compiled, it really only represents a snapshot of book censorship attempts,\" she adds.",
      "What the available data does show is that book banning disproportionately affects Black and Indigenous writers and authors of color, as well as authors from the LGBTQ+ community, Hohl says.",
      "Ranging from classics, including the works of James Baldwin and Toni Morrison, to modern young adult books like \"The Hate U Give\" and \"The Poet X,\" books by Black authors have been impacted by bans for decades.",
      "The censorship of diverse voices can also come about by individual people's choices \u2014 for example, unilateral censorship by a library worker, which the ALA defines as a librarian excluding materials for display or purchase \"without consulting anyone.\"",
      "Quartez Harris is the the author of \"Go Tell It,\" an illustrated biography of James Baldwin, whose works have been repeatedly banned across the U.S. He's also a former second-grade teacher. During his time as a teacher, while books weren't explicitly banned at his school, he says he witnessed what he calls \"quiet banning,\" or indirectly keeping books from readers.",
      "\"A lot of teachers didn't really feature books that reflected our students' lived experiences. We were a predominantly Black school, but a lot of the literature did not depict our demographic,\" Harris says.",
      "Book banning has also become just one part of \"more extreme\" attempts at censorship, Sonya Douglass, a professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, says. Classrooms around the country face challenges on what they can teach and the terminology used, she says. In 2021, school districts across the country faced battles over what can be taught about race and gender. Nine states enacted laws limiting instruction of critical race theory \u2014\u00a0a framework that looks at how racism is systemic \u2014 that year, per NBC News.",
      "\"(Book banning is) now, I think, even being overshadowed by a lot of the efforts to just limit the opportunity to teach about race, racism and the truth of American racism,\" Douglass says.",
      "A lot of teachers didn't really feature books that reflected my our students lived experiences. We were a predominantly Black school, but a lot of the literature did not depict our demographic.\u201d",
      "Quartez Harris",
      "Jewell Parker Rhodes, whose book \"Ghost Boys\" has faced bans, says the experience has been triggering.",
      "\"I have trauma from the banned books themselves,\" Rhodes says. \"I've been teaching African American literature for decades... When you lose the voice of the African American literature, you lose the voice of African American people.\"",
      "To push back against censorship, Harris encourages readers to \"challenge these baseless claims that books are harmful. Books make people better.\"",
      "Here are banned books by Black authors across genres to celebrate Black History Month all year-round.",
      "Classics",
      "\"The Color Purple\" by Alice Walker",
      "Alice Walker's 1982 epistolary novel tells the story of a young Black woman named Celie through the letters she writes to God about her experiences in early 1900s Georgia. \"The Color Purple\" has consistently made the American Library Association's list of most frequently challenged books, coming in at No. 17 for the 2000-2009 list and No. 50 for 2010-2019, primarily for its sexual and racial content.",
      "Walker, now 81, spoke about attempts to censor \"The Color Purple\" in a 2012 interview with Guernica magazine and said, \"I remember feeling, and understanding, the fear that drove some parents in the schools to wish to ban 'The Color Purple.'\"",
      "\"Many people of course condemned 'The Color Purple' unread. Some read the first five pages and decided they were doing society a service by silencing the voice of a 14-year-old uneducated Black girl whose only language was what she\u2019d heard in her community, where people rarely spoke in euphemisms,\" she continued.",
      "\"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison",
      "Toni Morrison is another author whose work often makes the ALA's list of frequently challenged books, including her classic titles \"The Bluest Eye\" (the No. 10 most frequently challenged book of 2010-2019) and \"Beloved\" (No. 26 on the same list). \"The Bluest Eye,\" which follows a young traumatized girl who wishes to have \"blue eyes,\" has been banned for its depiction of child abuse and focus on racism. \"Beloved,\" about a family of formerly enslaved people who are being haunted, has also been banned for its violent content. Morrison edited a 2009 anthology of essays about censorship called \"Burn this Book\" and wrote, \u201cFear of unmonitored writing is justified \u2014 because truth is trouble.\"",
      "Andrea Davis Pinkney, the author of children's books like \"The Red Pencil\" and \"Sit-In,\" also worked with Morrison to edit her children's books. Pinkney says Morrison taught that times of \"dread\" is \"the exact moment that artists need to get to work.\"",
      "\"This is the moment where we get on the path, we stay in the work, and we tell the stories, because that's what's gonna endure at the end of the day. That's what will last,\" she says of Morrison's wisdom. \"And you can't ban that.\"",
      "\"Native Son\" by Richard Wright",
      "Richard Wright\u2019s \"Native Son\" follows Bigger Thomas and the catastrophic chain of events that occur after he accidentally kills a white woman. While \"Native Son\" does not make light of Bigger\u2019s crimes, some of the book\u2019s wider themes explore the effects systemic racism may have had and the hypocrisy of the justice system. Although Wright\u2019s work is considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, it has been banned in multiple school districts for language, sexual content and violence.",
      "\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" by James Baldwin",
      "James Baldwin's \"Go Tell It On the Mountain\" is about a teenager's complex family dynamics and his relationship with the Pentecostal Church. The book has been banned at least twice for its profanity and sexual content, according to PEN America.",
      "Quartez Harris, the author of \"Go Tell It,\" a picture book biography of Baldwin that came out in January 2025, tells TODAY.com that reading the work of Baldwin allows readers to \"connect with other people's pain \u2014\u00a0his pain and the world's pain.\"",
      "\"He used language to figure out what was happening to him and what was happening in the world,\" Harris says.",
      "\"We're able to process our lived experiences through his work, but if we're censoring his work, if we're sanctioning his work, then you're limiting people from feeling celebrating, feeling seen, feeling validated, feeling liberated,\" he adds. \"And that's a deep concern.\"",
      "\"Invisible Man\" by Ralph Ellison",
      "Ralph Ellison's 1952 novel \"Invisible Man\" follows an unnamed Black man struggling with his identity in a world that sees him through a variety of predetermined lenses. It chronicles his teenage years to adulthood and the ways racism renders him \"invisible.\"",
      "In 2013, \"Invisible Man\" was banned from school libraries in a North Carolina county after a parent complained of its language, sexual content and \"lack of innocence,\" per the Los Angeles Times.",
      "\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" by Zora Neale Hurston",
      "\u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d is a classic novel of the Harlem Renaissance. It follows a young woman through her journey of finding love, stability and independence and asserting her own dignity amid a traumatic family history. \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" was banned in the '90s in Virginia for its language and sexual content.",
      "Children\u2019s and young adult books",
      "\"The Hate U Give\" by Angie Thomas",
      "Angie Thomas' 2017 young adult novel \"The Hate U Give\" follows a 16-year-old Black girl who witnesses her friend's death at the hands of a police officer. As she bends toward activism, it causes tension at her predominately white school. The book has been banned for its depiction of police and references to drugs and sex. \"The Hate U Give\" was adapted into a movie in 2018.",
      "Thomas spoke about book banning on a panel alongside George M. Johnson during the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in 2023. \u201cWe weren\u2019t writing to have a political agenda,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe were writing about experiences. We were writing about real people. I\u2019ve had 16-year-old white, rural Americans tell me, \u2018I didn\u2019t know any Black people. But this book helps me to learn things that Black people have gone through.\u2019\u201d",
      "\"My Princess Boy\" by Cheryl Kilodavis",
      "\"My Princess Boy\" is a children's picture book that published in 2009. The book is about a young boy who chooses to wear traditionally \"girly\" attire and receives support from his family. The picture book has faced several challenges on the grounds of its depiction of gender expression. In 2022, it was banned pending investigation in a Florida school district, per PEN America.",
      "\"The Poet X\" by Elizabeth Acevedo",
      "\"The Poet X\" is a coming of age novel-in-verse written by Elizabeth Acevedo. It follows Xiomara, or X, as she utilizes slam poetry to express her conflicting feelings on her religion, her sexuality and her place in the world as an Afro-Latina teen. Acevedo\u2019s book was challenged because Xiomara dared to question her religion, thus deeming it \"anti-Christian.\" It was also challenged for containing content relating to sexuality and race.",
      "Speaking to high school students in Washington, D.C. in January 2024, Acevedo said, per the American Federation of Teachers' website, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking themes. We\u2019re talking about people who exist in the world. We\u2019re talking about characters who exist; we are people. They\u2019re not banning these books to protect y\u2019all, because oftentimes these books are about y\u2019all. They\u2019re banning these books because they\u2019re saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want certain demographics of kids to know that other kinds of young people exist and that within their community, other kinds of people exist.'\"",
      "\"Monster\" by Walter Dean Myers",
      "\"Monster\" is a 1999 young adult novel about a 16-year-old on trial for murder. Written like a screenplay, the book interweaves the events of the trial with the protagonist's journal entries and memories of what happened. The book explores choices, racial discrimination and more, and it has been banned for its violence, language and mature content.",
      "\"Brown Girl Dreaming\" by Jacqueline Woodson",
      "\"Brown Girl Dreaming\" is a memoir written for teens about author Jacqueline Woodson's experience growing up across the US in the late 1960s. The book, which is written in verse, explores Woodson's upbringing in the context of religion, the Civil Rights movement, the culture of the South and more. The author told Lit Hub her book was on banned book lists in Florida and Texas.",
      "\"To come into this art, wanting to create stories that were not there when I was a young person and wanting no other young person to feel themselves invisible in this world? The attempt at erasure is heartbreaking to me. It\u2019s not even about me, it\u2019s about the young people that don\u2019t get to see themselves,\" Woodson told Lit Hub in December 2024.",
      "\"Ghost Boys\" by Jewell Parker Rhodes",
      "\"Ghost Boys,\" Jewell Parker Rhodes' 2018 middle-grade novel, follows a young Black student, Jerome, who is shot by a white policeman who mistook a play gun for a weapon. Jerome returns in the story as a ghost and meets other \"ghost boys,\" including Emmett Till. The book was temporarily banned in Florida for its depiction of police.",
      "Rhodes says she wrote \"Ghost Boys\" while \"loving\" all her characters, including the policeman. She says her goal is to spark discussions over if unconscious bias or racism was an aspect of the shooting.",
      "Rhodes, whose latest book, \u201cWill\u2019s Race For Home,\u201d published in January 2025, says, \u201cWhen you have books banned from a classroom, it\u2019s like saying you want to render all the kids of color invisible. That their experiences aren\u2019t worth talking about.\u201d",
      "Nonfiction",
      "\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" by Malcolm X, Alex Haley",
      "\u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X\u201d published in 1965, shortly  after Malcolm X was assassinated. The book was the product of interviews between Alex Haley and the civil rights activist and took a deep dive on Malcolm X\u2019s philosophies. The book has faced calls for bans for years, dating back to 1993, for its discussion of race relations. Another work by Haley, \u201cRoots: The Saga of An American Family,\u201d was also notably banned for the first time during the 2023-24 school year, according to PEN America.",
      "\"The New Jim Crow\" by Michelle Alexander",
      "\"The New Jim Crow\" is a 2010 nonfiction book about racial discrimination and mass incarceration, comparing the latter to a modern \"Jim Crow\" system. Key points involve analyzing enforcement of the War of Drugs and the disproportionate rates of imprisonment among Black men. In 2018, \"The New Jim Crow\" was banned in prisons in New Jersey, per the ACLU.",
      "\"Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents\" by Isabel Wilkerson",
      "\u201cCaste\u201d by journalist Isabel Wilkerson argues that racism in the US is an example of a caste system and dives into the consequences of it. The book inspired the film \u201cOrigin,\u201d which stars Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor as Wilkerson and follows the research process for the book. \u201cCaste\u201d faced a ban in Texas, and, according to a 2022 report from the Washington Post, the book \u201cmysteriously vanished\u201d from shelves.",
      "Speaking with Oprah Daily in 2023, Wilkerson said, \u201cThese bans only affirm the forewarnings in the book. We\u2019re in a period of backlash and retrenchment, which the book attests to and foreshadows. The only thing I can do is to keep pressing forward in my work, knowing that we can\u2019t run from history and that the truth will win out in the end.\u201d",

In 2020, the \u201cremix,\" \"Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You,\" was named the second-most challenged book by the ALA. The book was banned and challenged because of the author\u2019s \u201cpublic statements, claims that the book contains \u2018selective storytelling incidents,\u2019 and does not encompass racism against all people.\"",
      "\u201cBook bans aim to suppress critical thinking, suppress the factual record, suppress the historical record, suppress a multiplicity of experiences and perspectives, and suppress our recognition of racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry,\u201d Kendi has said, according to a 2024 news release from PEN America. \u201cBy challenging these bans, we\u2019re not just defending books\u2014we\u2019re defending against well-funded and well-organized efforts to control our minds. Censorship is about control. I am not about to let anyone control my mind or yours.\u201d",

      "\u201cThese books that are being banned predominantly feature authors and characters of color, authors and characters of the LGBTQ community, and so we\u2019re seeing entire identities erased from bookshelves. And when a child can\u2019t see themselves represented in a story, they can\u2019t dream of their own life, to actualize their own hopes,\u201d Gorman said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in February, during an interview about her new book, \u201cGirls on the Rise.\u201d",
      "\"All Boys Aren't Blue\" by George M. Johnson",
      "In \"All Boys Aren\u2019t Blue,\" a debut young adult memoir-manifesto, George M. Johnson chronicles their coming of age as a queer Black child through a series of essays. Johnson\u2019s book serves as an exploration of Johnson\u2019s identity, while encouraging readers to  find their own truth. Because Johnson\u2019s book was deemed sexually explicit and has LGBTQ+ themes, it\u2019s currently one of the most banned books in the country.",
      "At the 2023 Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, Johnson said they believe efforts to ban books stem from fear of Gen Z-led change and that they plan to keep creating.",
      "\u201cMy philosophy has been, \u2018Well they can\u2019t ban all the damn books,\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo I keep writing.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country\u201d in order for Ukraine to continue pursuing a peace deal negotiated by the U.S.",
      "His comments come just two days after President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy publicly sparred in the Oval Office while the Ukrainian president visited Washington to finish negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is trying to get these two parties to a point of peace,\u201d Johnson said during an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding: \u201cWhat President Zelenskyy did in the White House was effectively signal to us that he\u2019s not ready for that yet, and I think that\u2019s a great disappointment.\u201d",
      "Johnson emphasized that Trump \u201chas been very clear about this \u2014\u00a0that if [Zelenskyy] is ready for peace, then we can negotiate a deal.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he was seeking to include security guarantees \u2014 or assurances that the U.S. would come to Ukraine\u2019s aid if Russia violates a ceasefire deal \u2014 in the mineral rights agreement.",
      "In the Oval Office spat, Trump told Zelenskyy that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the cards\u201d to negotiate and joined Vance in asking the Ukrainian president to be more grateful for U.S. support for Ukraine.",
      "Following the contentious meeting, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called on Zelenskyy to resign, telling reporters at the White House that the meeting was a \"complete, utter disaster.\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham said, adding that the Ukrainian president, \"either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Johnson on Sunday echoed the president and vice president, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker that Zelenskyy \u201cberated and interrupted his host, instead of expressing gratitude for the extraordinary help that the U.S. has provided his country.\u201d",
      "Johnson also argued that security guarantees were inherent in the mineral rights deal, telling Welker, \u201cThis mineral rights deal is a win, a win for everyone. It will give us access to rare earth minerals that we need, and it will provide a level of security for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey will effectively be in an economic partnership with us after that point, and we will definitely always defend our interests and our investments,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cRussia knows that. China knows that. Iran, North Korea know that, and that\u2019s a very important message for us.\u201d",
      "Asked if Putin was the \"winner\" in the fallout from the tense Oval Office exchange, Johnson said \"No, he wasn't.\"",
      "In an interview later on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., pushed back on GOP officials\u2019 calls for Zelenskyy to resign, telling Welker, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in calling on the resignation of other world leaders.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrankly, I think that would spiral Ukraine into chaos right now, trying to find who is the negotiator\u201d for a peace deal, Lankford added.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also pushed back on calls for Zelenskyy to resign, calling it a \"horrific suggestion\" on \"Meet the Press\" later Sunday.",
      "\"Zelenskyy is leading a country, trying to defend democracy against an authoritarian dictator \u2014 Putin \u2014 who invaded his country,\" Sanders added.",
      "Johnson also spoke about the massive budget reconciliation bill that House Republicans passed last week, which now heads to a group of House and Senate GOP leaders as they seek to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions on the bill.",
      "House Republicans\u2019 bill includes $2 trillion in spending cuts, which some opponents of the measure say could impact Medicaid funding, affecting health care and insurance for millions of low-income and disabled people.",
      "Johnson on Sunday said that House Republicans did not intend to touch Medicaid funding in the budget bill, telling Welker, \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it, Kristen, go do a word search of the budget resolution that we passed on Tuesday. There is not one mention of Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American people want us to review the expenditures of the country and get our fiscal house in order, and that\u2019s what we must do,\u201d Johnson said, adding that House Republicans also want to extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts measure, which expires this year.",
      "\u201cWe can do both of those things simultaneously and not affect benefits for anyone who relies upon those and is eligible to receive them,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "But on Friday, Trump adviser and tech mogul Elon Musk made several false claims about Social Security, signaling that he would seek to evaluate that agency for cuts in the future.",
      "Asked whether Social Security is Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s next target, Johnson told Welker, \u201cI\u2019ve met with Elon about this multiple times. We meet late into the night in his office, and we\u2019ve looked at that. What he\u2019s finding with his algorithms crawling through the data of Social Security system is enormous amounts of fraud, waste and abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a moral responsibility to ensure that those programs are conducted in a way that does not allow for this, this massive fraud and abuse, and that\u2019s what he is finding,\u201d Johnson added.",
      "Sanders on Sunday called Musk's comments \"totally outrageous,\" during an interview on \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "\"I think what Musk, the wealthiest guy in the world, just said is totally outrageous,\" he said.",
      "\"That's a hell of a 'Ponzi scheme,'\" Sanders said, referring to what Musk called Social Security on Friday, \"When for the last 80 years, Social Security has paid out every nickel owed to every eligible American.\""

      "Egypt, which helped broker the original ceasefire deal, condemned Israel\u2019s closure of Gaza, with the foreign minister Badr Abdelatty accusing Israel of using aid \u201cas a weapon of collective punishment and starvation.\u201d",
      "Basem Naim, a senior official for Hamas\u2019 political bureau, said Israel was \u201csabotaging\u201d the existing three-phase ceasefire agreement both sides had signed in January.",
      "He condemned Benjamin Netanyahu and the Trump administration for what he called \u201ca blatant coup against the ceasefire deal,\u201d adding that Israel bears \u201call the responsibility for escalating the situation and for the lives of the people on both sides.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s announcement came after Netanyahu held an overnight security meeting where Israel adopted a plan by U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff that proposed extending the first phase of the six-week ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, rather than moving to the second phase of negotiations outlined under the original agreement.",
      "Under Witkoff\u2019s proposal, half of the remaining hostages, including the bodies of those who have died, would also be released on the first day, with the remaining released when both sides successfully negotiate a permanent ceasefire, according to Netanyahu\u2019s office.",
      "Hamas has refused the proposal, insisting that the ceasefire talks proceed to the second stage, which would see the release of additional hostages and prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and lead to a permanent end to the war.",
      "Hamas said Israel\u2019s decision to halt aid amounted to \u201cblackmailing\u201d and urged mediators U.S., Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on Israel to implement humanitarian protocol under the ceasefire.",
      "Since the ceasefire agreement came into effect on Jan. 19, more than 10,000 aid trucks carrying food, medicine and tents have arrived in Gaza, according to the United Nations\u2019 top aid official, Tom Fletcher. The first phase also halted months of fighting and saw the exchange of 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "The current war began with the\u00a0Hamas-led terror attack\u00a0on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 251 were captured, according to Israeli officials. Israel\u2019s ensuing military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the local Health Ministry, destroyed much of the enclave and forcibly displaced most of its population of 2.2 million.",
      "Israeli far-right lawmakers welcomed Netanyahu\u2019s decision to block aid. \u201cThe decision we made last night to completely halt the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza ... is an important step in the right direction \u2014 \u2018the threshold of the gates of hell,\u2019\u201d Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich posted on X on Sunday.",
      "He then called for the gates of hell to be opened \u201cas quickly and as lethally as possible.\u201d",
      "By Sunday morning, Israeli forces had killed at least four people across Gaza, Dr. Marwan Al-Hams, director general of field hospitals, told NBC News.",
      "The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Gaza Strip \u2014 charges Israel rejects. The Biden administration also rejected the arrest warrants, but along with many members of the international community warned of a humanitarian crisis\u00a0in Gaza after Israel allowed little aid to enter during more than a year of fighting.",
      "The International Red Cross, which has acted as a\u00a0neutral humanitarian intermediary to oversee hostage-prisoner swaps, urged both sides to keep \u201cthe forward momentum\u201d of the ceasefire\u2019s last six weeks going.",
      "\u201cEvery effort must be made to maintain the ceasefire so that lives are spared from hostilities, humanitarian aid enters Gaza, and more families are reunited,\u201d the aid group said in a statement Sunday.",
      "The aid closure also extinguished a rare, brief moment of celebration in Gaza, where Palestinians had gathered, often among the rubble, for the beginning of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month commemorated with daytime fasts and nighttime feasts.",
      "On Friday, 12-year-old Hala Nagy Abou Mostafa expressed hope and relief in an interview with NBC's crew in Gaza.",
      "\u201cLast year, during Ramadan, we lived in tents in Rafah. Ramadan last year was very difficult,\" Hala said. \"But we will be happy this year. We will eat Suhoor at our homes in Khan Younis and feel very joyful,\" she said, referring to the pre-dawn meal before the start of the day's fast.",
      "\"The difference between Ramadan this year and last year is that there is a truce, and we hope it holds so the war doesn\u2019t return,\" she added, not knowing then what the coming days would bring."

      "Later on Saturday evening, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will adopt a plan by U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff that would extend the temporary ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, which conclude at the end of March and on April 20, respectively.",
      "Under the proposal, half of the remaining hostages, including bodies of those who have died, would be released on day one of its execution, with the rest released upon successful negotiation of a permanent ceasefire, according to Netanyahu's office. Israel\u2019s move to adopt the plan was made during an overnight security meeting, it said.",
      "If a more permanent deal is out of reach on the 42nd day of peace negotiations, Israel can return to fighting, Netanyahu\u2019s office said. That provision, it said, is supported by the Trump administration.",
      "The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Hamas has yet to accept the proposal and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office. Separately, Israel has not confirmed the latest developments in its negotiations with Hamas and also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Israel said it would immediately begin negotiating on the details of the plan if Hamas changes its stance.",

      "The second phase of the ceasefire would have seen the release of additional hostages and prisoners, mark the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and ultimately lead to a permanent end to the war.",

      "The U.S., Egypt and Qatar \u2014 the three countries that helped mediate the deal \u2014 continue to act as guarantors of the agreement.",
      "Amid concerns around the truce, the Pentagon said Friday that the U.S. State Department had approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs and other weaponry to Israel on an emergency basis. The sale marked the second time the Trump administration declared an emergency to approve weapons sales to Israel since last month.",
      "The fragile ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on Jan. 19, halted months of fighting and allowed the exchange of 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "Under the agreement, Israeli forces were due to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor on Saturday, a provision that has remained a major sticking point in the ceasefire negotiations.",
      "Israel earlier said it would not allow Hamas to take over the corridor.",
      "\u201cWe will not withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor.\u00a0We will not allow Hamas murderers to roam our borders again with trucks and rifles, and we will not let them rearm through smuggling,\u201d an Israeli official told NBC News on Thursday, referring to the weapons and other materials that entered Gaza over the Egyptian border.",
      "The narrow strip of land that runs along Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt and includes the key Rafah border crossing has also been a lifeline for Palestinians in Gaza \u2014 allowing the entry of goods and humanitarian aid in the years before the war.",
      "Another major sticking point is Hamas\u2019 continued presence in Gaza. On Thursday, Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, told NBC News that the militant group would be willing to cede political and administrative power in the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but would not disarm until an independent Palestinian state is achieved.",
      "Naim added that the group was also preparing for renewed fighting. \u201cIf they decide to escalate and to return back to war, we are preparing ourselves for all options,\u201d he said.",
      "For now, the situation in the Gaza Strip has remained calm, according to NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground.",

      "\u201cThe war has created a psychological state for us. I try to overcome the experiences I lived by working, channeling the negative energy into my work,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI am worried that the war will resume. It was the worst day of our lives.\u201d",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urged Israel and Hamas \"to exercise maximum restraint and find a way forward on the next phase\" of the ceasefire.",

      "\u201cWe are ready today, if not yesterday, to step back from governance to hand it over to a body, a government, a committee, that is ready to run the Gaza Strip,\u201d Naim said.",
      "Naim made his comments during a critical impasse: The first phase of a tenuous deal between Hamas and Israel is set to end on Saturday, and no arrangements have been made for continuing the ceasefire.",
      "While there have been few publicly acknowledged negotiations to extend the truce into a second phase, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it will soon send a diplomatic delegation to Cairo to continue talks.",
      "Naim said that beyond that public announcement, Hamas had not been officially notified of Israel's intention to resume negotiations.",
      "It was unclear whether Israeli officials would seek to extend the first phase of the agreement or negotiate terms for a second phase, which could ultimately lead to a more permanent ceasefire and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Naim said Israel was deliberately delaying further negotiations to create a pretext for returning to war against Hamas.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is intentionally done to escalate the situation or to push the second-phase negotiations under the threat to return back to war and not to withdraw from the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli troops are supposed to start withdrawing from the Gaza-Egypt border area on Saturday, marking the end of the ceasefire's first phase. However, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan on Thursday that Israel has demanded that their military stay in the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "The last step of the agreement\u2019s six-week first phase came overnight, when Israel released more than 600 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas handed over the corpses of four Israeli hostages killed during captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms \u2014 which were reached with help from intermediaries Qatar and Egypt in late January, after more than a year of fraught negotiations \u2014 talks on the second stage should have begun weeks ago.",
      "But rather than returning to the negotiating table, each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement\u2019s terms. Several of the weekly exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners have been dogged by last-minute accusations and near-cancellations.",
      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "The thorniest question standing in the way of negotiating the second phase of an agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared Hamas\u2019 destruction as the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 sometimes, his critics have said, superseding the freedom and welfare of the Israeli hostages still being held there.",
      "Though he reiterated Hamas\u2019 offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, Basem Naim said the group would only disarm and transform into a purely political party if Palestinians are granted an independent political state \u2014 a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in government have repeatedly rejected.",
      "\u201cThese are two different tracks. The arms are related to the existence or the presence of the occupation,\u201d he said, referring to Israel's ongoing presence in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.",
      "If an independent Palestinian state is created, Naim said, \u201cwe are ready again to become a political party and to integrate our fighters into a Palestinian national army.\u201d",
      "Israeli military leaders have repeatedly made clear that they are prepared to return to war if the agreement collapses, going so far as to call up reservists for renewed fighting.",

      "\u201cIf they decide to escalate and to return back to war, we are preparing ourselves for all options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice other than to defend ourselves, as we have done already along the 15 months.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group\u2019s intentions and underestimated its capabilities.",
      "The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack, which triggered\u00a0the war in Gaza.",
      "Many Israelis believe the mistakes of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military, and they blame Netanyahu for what they view as a failed strategy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That strategy included allowing Qatar to send\u00a0suitcases of cash\u00a0into Gaza and sidelining Hamas\u2019 rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.",
      "The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire.\u00a0Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry.",
      "The military\u2019s main findings were that the region\u2019s most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas\u2019 intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday.",
      "The military\u2019s findings are\u00a0in line with past conclusions\u00a0reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was a complete failure,\u201d said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found.",
      "The military also misjudged the militant group\u2019s capabilities. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes.",
      "Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said.",
      "The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to the Israeli network.",
      "The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017.",
      "With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border.",
      "From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military\u2019s command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a\u00a0music festival\u00a0with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure.",
      "It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants.",
      "According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals.",
      "Some high-ranking officers\u00a0have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel\u2019s top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there is \u201cvalue\u201d in an agreement that President Donald Trump is pursuing on Ukrainian mineral rights to repay some of the $500 billion in military aid that the U.S. has sent in support of the country's war against Russia.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss efforts at ending the Russia-Ukraine war and a possible trade deal with the U.S., said in an interview with NBC News that economic ties between Washington and Kyiv could be considered a form of security.",
      "\u201cI can see the value in the approach in relation to minerals,\u201d Starmer said in the interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter between President Trump and President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. But I can see very clearly the argument that President Trump makes in relation to minerals, and I can also see the validity of his points when he says that if there is a deal on minerals then the U.S. has economic interests in Ukraine, which, if you like, form at least one element of any security guarantee.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat, in its own right, is an important aspect.\u201d",
      "Trump has been vocal about his interest in settling the yearslong conflict in Ukraine and talked about compensation for the billions of dollars in aid that Washington has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. But he has shied away from committing to any security guarantees, saying this week that he would ask Europe to take the lead on that.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump warned that if a peace deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody wants peace, everybody wants bloodshed to end. Not least the Ukrainians,\u201d Starmer told NBC News, adding that discussions were already underway on what security would look like.",
      "Asked if Britain can achieve its objectives without U.S. participation, Starmer responded that \u201cthe first thing is to get the European element in place.\u201d",
      "He said Trump \u201cis right\u201d to press for talks to drive forward a deal, while adding words of caution about Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that we know, historically, that Putin might go again,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cHe has ambitions in relation to Ukraine. And therefore, if there\u2019s to be a deal, it has got to be a deal that lasts.\u201d",
      "The Starmer-Trump meeting comes at a sensitive time for the United Kingdom as the prime minister commits to sending British troops to Ukraine to help secure a \u201clasting peace\u201d if a peace deal with Russia is reached.\u201cThe stakes, they couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Starmer said during a joint news conference with Trump at the White House. He said it was essential that Ukraine be \u201cbacked by strength that will stop Putin coming back for more.\u201d",
      "Starmer, standing beside Trump, insisted that any deal should put to rest Russian ambitions and committed to putting \u201cboots on the ground and planes in the sky\u201d to limit future incursions into Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump offered praise to Starmer, greeting him warmly at several junctures throughout the day. The two leaders held a bilateral meeting and continued their discussions on Ukraine and a possible trade deal over lunch, Trump said during the news conference.",
      "Starmer is a \u201cspecial man,\u201d Trump said, adding that they \u201cget along famously.\u201d",
      "The meeting came a day before the president is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in Washington, as Trump hopes the U.S and Ukraine can sign an agreement on rare mineral rights.",
      "The deal to jointly develop Ukrainian resources has been envisioned as a step toward an eventual peace deal between Ukraine and Russia."

      "If the Trump administration continues to antagonize its partners and question its alliances, there is a risk that China \u2014 as well as Russia\u2014\u00a0could expand their spheres of influence in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and Eastern Europe, experts said.\u00a0In Asia, stunned officials in countries aligned with the United States are grappling with the implications of the apparent about-face in Washington, said Michael Green, chief executive officer of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this deeply unnerved even our closest allies in Asia,\u201d said Green, who served on the White House National Security Council under President George W. Bush.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive dismantling of the U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid has had ripple effects abroad, according to Green. U.S. embassies are hampered by the chaos in Washington and funding for democracy programs has dried up, a potential boon for China, he said.",
      "\u201cSenior officials in Japan, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand have told me that China is swooping in, offering to replace the United States as the partner of choice,\u201d Green said.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s treatment of Ukraine has raised fears among Asian allies that Washington may not come to the aid of Taiwan if China seeks to seize control of the island by force or coercion, former U.S. officials said.",
      "Before French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump in Washington on Monday, Macron said: \u201cHow can you, then, be credible in the face of China if you\u2019re weak in the face of Putin?\u201d",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that if America were to scale back military assistance for Ukraine, it would allow the U.S. to focus its resources on the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "The image that America has long tried to present to the world, as a champion of democratic rule and a counterweight to autocracy, also seemed to be radically altered. Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said last week that America had once been seen as a force for \u201cmoral legitimacy\u201d and was now looking like \u201ca landlord seeking rent.\u201d",
      "Pushing allies?",
      "The Trump administration and its supporters say the president is merely pushing allies to pay a bigger share of their own defense needs, recalibrating trade relationships and working to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s America First approach to diplomacy prioritizes what\u2019s in the best interest of the United States,\u201d said Brian Hughes, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration will continue to engage our allies and partners to improve burden-sharing measures for defense spending, rebalancing trade deficits and ensuring global adversaries do not take advantage of America as they did under Biden,\u201d Hughes added.",
      "But for Europe, there is now a grim determination to prepare for a future without America at its side.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the presumptive next chancellor of Germany after the country\u2019s parliamentary elections Sunday, said it was unclear if the NATO alliance would survive.",
      "\u201cAfter Donald Trump\u2019s statements in the last week, it is clear that the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,\u201d Merz, the leader of the center-right CDU/CSU alliance, said on German television.",
      "Members of NATO and the European Union currently lack the military strength, economic unity and political will to be able to secure peace in Ukraine and fill the void currently filled by the U.S., Bindenagel and other former officials said.",
      "\u201cRussia is not an all-powerful adversary with an economy the size of Italy\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is simply far more determined than we are, which amplifies its limited potential tremendously.\u201d",
      "Nile Gardiner, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, which strongly supports the president\u2019s agenda, said that despite the friction with European governments, Trump will likely bolster the NATO alliance with his policies and possibly end a war that threatens to destabilize Europe.",
      "European countries, including the United Kingdom, recently announced further increases in defense spending, which Gardiner said was a response to Trump\u2019s demands for NATO allies to take more responsibility for the continent\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re already seeing the Trump effect across Europe, and I think that Trump\u2019s goal is to leave NATO in far, far stronger shape four years from now, than when he inherited it,\u201d he said.",
      "But a flawed peace agreement that fails to provide sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine against future Russian attacks could embolden Putin and produce even greater dangers for Europe, said Timothy Sayle, author of \"Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order.\"",
      "\u201cWhat might feel like peace in the short term could be laying the conditions for a broader war in the future,\u201d said Sayle, an associate professor of history at the University of Toronto.",
      "If Russia is allowed to retain the territory it has seized in Ukraine, a peace deal could provide Moscow with a platform to stage further incursions or covert operations against other European countries nearby, including the Baltic states, he said.",
      "In a speech at Monday\u2019s U.N. session on Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski said that ending the war \u201cat any cost\u201d by appeasing Russia would be a fatal error.",
      "Such a move would only invite further aggression, he said. \u201cIf Ukraine is abandoned today, who will be next?\u201d"

      "The arrival of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group at the South Korean port of Busan was meant to display a solid\u00a0U.S-South Korean military alliance\u00a0in the face of persistent\u00a0North Korean threats, and boost interoperability of the allies\u2019 combined assets, the South Korean navy said in a statement.",
      "It said it was the first U.S. aircraft carrier to travel to South Korea since June.",
      "The deployment of the carrier is expected to infuriate North Korea, which views temporary deployments of such powerful U.S. military assets as major security threats.

      "The images of China\u2019s Dalian shipbuilding facility in northeast China suggest that the new ship will allow fighter jets to be launched from four parts of the flight deck, leading analysts to conclude that the images suggest a new ship design \u2014 unlike anything now in the Chinese fleet.",
      "The analysts made the assessment after examining images provided to NBC News by Maxar Technologies, a defense contractor headquartered in Colorado used by the U.S. government.",
      "China\u2019s three current aircraft carriers have the capacity to launch jets from only three parts on the front and the waist, or center, on the deck. Its latest supercarrier, the recently launched Fujian, a Type 003, has three electromagnetic catapult launching systems to propel fighter jets, Duitsman said.",

      "The general consensus, he said, is\" that the new carrier will have four catapults,\u201d which would allow more planes to take off and match U.S. carriers like the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's largest and most advanced aircraft carrier. To accommodate four catapults, the ship will need to be larger than the Fujian, matching American tonnage and powered by a nuclear reactor.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The \u201cwanted\u201d posters were sent by mail, arriving at the homes of Carmen Lau\u2019s neighbors in the town of Maidenhead.",
      "The alleged crime? Speaking out about China\u2019s rule in Hong Kong, where Lau has not lived since 2021.",
      "Provide information about Lau to the Hong Kong Police Force, urged the poster, folded into envelopes with Hong Kong stamps, or \u201ctake her to the Chinese embassy.\u201d",
      "The reward: 1 million Hong Kong dollars, or $130,000.",
      "The flyers that arrived in this town 7 miles from Windsor Castle are the latest threat directed at Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy diaspora, who have fled the city trying to escape the long arm of Chinese law, only to find that harassment can cross borders.",
      "Lau, who spoke to NBC News from outside the U.K. on Friday, said she did not \u201cfeel safe living at my current address,\u201d and was now weighing temporary residence options elsewhere. (NBC News is not disclosing Lau\u2019s current location for her safety.)",
      "Joshua Reynolds, Maidenhead\u2019s MP, says at least five people reported receiving the letters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unsure what to do about it, they\u2019re unsure why they received it, or what was going on,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Friday, adding that he had called Lau about them.",
      "Reynolds showed NBC News three identical posters that included Lau\u2019s headshot and information including an address, date of birth, ethnicity, build and height. Reynolds said he knows of at least one other Hong Kong activist whose neighbors have received similar letters.",
      "\u201cA reward of one million Hong Kong dollars is being offered by Hong Kong Police to any member of the public, who can provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to the Chinese embassy,\u201d it reads.",
      "Those with information should contact an email address or the Hong Kong Police Force\u2019s\u00a0British WhatsApp number, it says.",
      "\u201cThe bounty is because they want to silence us and they want to instill fear among our diaspora,\u201d said Lau, who fled Hong Kong in 2021 after the former British colony enacted a sweeping and vaguely worded national security law that gave the government more power to quash dissent.",
      "The law followed a political crackdown triggered by Hong Kong\u2019s 2019 pro-democracy protests. It threatens stringent penalties for a wide range of actions authorities call threats to national security, with the most severe \u2014 including treason and insurrection \u2014 punishable by life imprisonment. Lesser offenses, including the possession of seditious publications, could also lead to several years in jail.",
      "Lau was declared a criminal by police after she fled Hong Kong. The city\u2019s police placed the bounty on her after accusing her of violating the national security law and calling for her return.",
      "She said Hong Kong police had taken her relatives in for questioning twice this month. NBC News could not confirm her account.",
      "Calling the posters \u201cawful,\u201d Reynolds said it was \u201cjust not acceptable\u201d if it was true the flyers had been sent from China.",
      "It was not clear who sent the posters. A spokesperson from Hong Kong\u2019s government said it would \u201cnot issue any anonymous letter\u201d but that it \u201cwill definitely pursue\u201d those who had fled the territory \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201ctake every measure\u201d to bring them back.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in London did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Anonymous harassment has also been an issue within Hong Kong. In September, the Hong Kong Journalists Association said people from dozens of media outlets had received threatening messages in a \u201csystematic and organized\u201d campaign, calling it the largest-scale harassment of reporters it had ever seen.",
      "This is not the first time concerns have been raised about the safety of Hong Kong democracy activists living in Britain, which took in more than 120,000 people from its former colony in response to the national security law.",
      "Last May, British authorities charged three men, including the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London, with surveilling and gathering intelligence against Hong Kong democracy activists.",
      "Later that month, one of the men, Matthew Trickett, was found dead in a park, also in Maidenhead. Two other men, Chung Biu Yuen and Chi Leung Peter Wai, will go on trial next month. They deny the charges, which include breaking into a residence.",
      "Chinese officials have called the charges \u201cgroundless and slanderous.\u201d",
      "Reynolds, Maidenhead\u2019s MP, said residents in the town were \u201cconcerned that this looks like the Chinese are trying to interfere in the U.K., and that they don\u2019t want to be frightened by what\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "He added that police had told him they were making sure Lau \u201cgets the protection and security she requires.\u201d",
      "Thames Valley Police did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Reynolds, a member of the opposition Liberal Democrats party, said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by the British government\u2019s approach toward China.",
      "The Labour Party, which is currently in power, has been accused of complacency toward Beijing after ministers signaled their support for China\u2019s proposed plan to build a \u201cmega embassy\u201d in London.",
      "The plan has also been criticized by U.S. lawmakers, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., and Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., both of whom serve on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. In an open letter Wednesday, they said a Chinese Embassy of that scale would \u201conly embolden its efforts to intimidate and harass UK citizens and dissidents and experts across Europe.\u201d",
      "A British government spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday that \u201cattempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass, or harm their critics overseas, undermining democracy and the rule of law, are unacceptable,\u201d adding that they would \u201cencourage anyone to report concerns to the police.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the criticism of the Chinese Embassy plans.",
      "Lau said she had not been contacted by Britain\u2019s Home Office, the government department responsible for immigration and security, or the Foreign Office.",
      "\u201cI will just continue my work because if I back down or if I really silence myself, that\u2019s what they want,\u201d she added."

    "summary": "Trump's desire to win a Nobel Peace Prize may not be fulfilled as he increasingly breaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Twice in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, a Norwegian lawmaker stepped forward to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Now, when Christian Tybring-Gjedde watches Trump maneuver to stop the war between Ukraine and Russia, he doesn\u2019t see the same sort of diplomatic outreach that warrants a third.",
      "\u201cHe is dictating terms that the Europeans are very scared of and are really worried about what\u2019s going to come of this,\u201d Tybring-Gjedde said in an interview. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the prospect of a Nobel Peace Prize. But you never know.\u201d",
      "A peace deal looks more elusive now than at any point since Trump\u2019s return to power. His meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned dark, with Trump browbeating his counterpart for not being grateful enough for U.S. firepower that helped repel Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Negotiations with Ukraine appear to have collapsed for now, jeopardizing Trump\u2019s pledge to bring a quick end to the war \u2014 and perhaps spoiling his best shot at winning an award that has been on his mind for years.",
      "Four American presidents have won the Nobel Peace Prize, none named Trump. That missing piece of the resume grates on him, former aides say, as was evident during his meeting in the Oval Office last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cThey will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Trump said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about the award. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me.\u201d",
      "If not, it won\u2019t be for lack of trying.",
      "In the space of a few days last week, no fewer than three senior Trump administration officials or nominees made a case for Trump winning the prize, using similar talking points.",
      "Unprompted, both Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Rep. Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican nominated to be ambassador to the United Nations, told conservative activists that Trump is a president \u201cof peace\u201d who deserves the award.",
      "\u201cHe is going to end the war in Europe. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East,\u201d Waltz told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "\u201cAnd you know what?\u201d he added. \u201cBy the end of this, we\u2019re going to have the Nobel Peace Prize sitting next to the name of Donald J. Trump.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also mentioned the prize during an interview with Fox News. Without prompting, Bessent said Trump\u2019s plan to end the conflict between Ukraine and Russia merits the honor. If \u201cfairly awarded,\u201d he added, \u201cI think in a year he should get it from what I\u2019ve seen.\u201d",
      "The odds are tough and may hinge on the particulars of a truce between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 if there is one.",
      "Fears have risen in recent weeks that Trump will use his leverage to end the war on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s terms. His rhetoric has grown discernibly more hostile to Ukraine.",
      "Even before the angry meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, he called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d and suggested that Ukraine instigated the war.",
      "Now, Trump\u2019s anger has spilled into public view. As Zelenskyy sat with arms folded, Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded him like they would a disobedient schoolboy.",
      "\u201cHave you said \u2018thank you\u2019 once in this entire meeting?\u201d Vance said to Zelenskyy.",
      "In a testy tone, Trump told the Ukrainian leader, \u201cYou\u2019re either going to make a deal or we\u2019re out. And if we\u2019re out, you\u2019ll fight it out. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be pretty, but you\u2019ll fight it out. But you don\u2019t have the cards.\u201d",
      "At one point, Trump suggested he had bonded with Putin during his first term over what he called a \u201cphony witch hunt\u201d involving investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "\u201cLet me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Afterward, the White House canceled a side-by-side news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, who was told to leave the building. He\u2019s not welcome back, Trump later said in a statement, until he is \u201cready for Peace\u201d",
      "If Trump forges an agreement that\u2019s favorable to Russia while leaving the rest of Europe vulnerable to Putin\u2019s aggression, that might sour any prospect of winning the prize. A pro-Russia deal may not sit well with the Nobel selection committee, whose five members are appointed by the Norwegian parliament.",
      "\u201cIn Norway, we are bordering on Russia. This is very tough for all of us, because we are the ones who will be in jeopardy if Russia keeps on taking territory,\u201d said Tybring-Gjedde, a member of Norway\u2019s parliament serving on the defense and foreign affairs committees.",
      "The National Security Council did not return a request for comment for this article.",
      "\u2018They probably will never give it to me\u2019",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize became a running subplot of Trump\u2019s first term. At times he sounded captivated by the award.",
      "At a future farmers event in Indianapolis in 2018, Trump mentioned a previous American winner who had died nine years earlier, Norman Borlaug, a plant scientist who had helped combat global famine.",
      "While praising Borlaug, he said: \u201cCan you believe it?\u00a0He won the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey probably will never give it to me, even what I\u2019m doing in Korea, and in Idlib province and all of these places,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThey probably will never give it to me.\u00a0You know why?\u00a0Because they don\u2019t want to.\u201d",
      "Trump had two real shots at winning one back then: his efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons (that didn\u2019t happen) and to normalize relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors (that one did).",
      "In September 2020, Tybring-Gjedde nominated him for the Middle East peace deal known as the Abraham Accords, though when the winners were announced the following year, Trump was skunked.",
      "Co-winners Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov were journalists who had exposed abuses of power in the Philippines and Russia, respectively.",
      "Even the nomination was something the White House chose to celebrate. The White House press office released a statement drawing attention it. Campaigning for re-election in Ohio that month, Trump complained that the press hadn\u2019t paid enough to attention to the nomination, though having one\u2019s name put forward isn\u2019t necessarily a rare distinction.",
      "The list of people allowed to nominate someone is long. Quite long.",
      "Any member of a national legislature can put someone\u2019s name before the selection committee. (Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., nominated Trump last year). So can Cabinet ministers and heads of state (Japan\u2019s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated Trump for the 2019 prize). And university professors. And retired university professors. And someone serving on the board of directors of an organization that once won the prize. And anyone who advised the Nobel Committee in the past.",
      "Since Trump ran his first winning presidential campaign in 2016, an average of 323 people or groups a year have been nominated for the prize. That\u2019s enough to fill the rosters of six NFL teams.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. One topic they discussed was whether Trump would impose tariffs on Britain.",
      "If Starmer wants to ingratiate himself with Trump, there\u2019s an easy way to do it, said John Bolton, the White House national security adviser in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cPeople say, \u2018What would you recommend Starmer do?\u2019 and I said I would recommend that he nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Bolton said in an interview.",
      "Trump, he added, \u201cis definitely obsessed with it.\u201d",
      "A look at some previous winners suggests that Trump would be something of an anomaly if he\u2019s chosen. He\u2019s out of step with a few of the past winners.",
      "In 2012, the prize went to the European Union. At his first Cabinet meeting, held this week, Trump said he\u2019d soon be placing a 25% tariff on goods from the E.U., an institution he said was \u201cformed in order to screw the United States.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s allies say he has reason to be peeved. The last president to win the award was Barack Obama, who got it just nine months into his presidency, before he had notched any real achievements. Even Obama acknowledged in his acceptance speech that his accomplishments were \u201cslight.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the fair question to ask is, would Barack Obama have won for helping bring an end to the war\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, Mick Mulvaney, a former Trump White House chief of staff, said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think we all know the answer to that question.\u201d",
      "The makeup of the Nobel selection committee could impede whatever chance Trump might have. Winners aren\u2019t chosen based on isolated actions. A candidate\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d also comes into play.",
      "\u201cI will only remind you that any candidate for any Nobel Prize must have given a contribution to the greatest benefit of humankind,\u201d Berit Reiss-Andersen, a former chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told NBC News.",
      "The committee\u2019s new chairman, J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, is also secretary-general of PEN Norway, a group whose mission includes supporting free expression and \u201cwriters at risk.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not the career path of a MAGA enthusiast. Trump has faced criticism over his treatment of U.S. journalists on free speech grounds. One of his early actions has been to bar The Associated Press wire service from Air Force One and certain events in which only a small group of \u201cpool\u201d reporters are allowed to watch and ask questions.",
      "The punishment stems from the AP\u2019s decision to stick with the name \u201cGulf of Mexico,\u201d while noting that Trump has renamed it the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP has filed suit to have its access restored.",
      "Elite recognition",
      "Why would Trump care about the prize? He rode to power as a populist who disdains the elite. Yet the Nobel Peace Prize brims with elite validation.",
      "That\u2019s the duality. Trump may be allied with the MAGA movement, but some part of him seems to pine for elite recognition. He often mentions an uncle who taught at the prestigious MIT. When Pete Hegseth struggled to win Senate confirmation, Trump vouched for him in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d by mentioning that Hegseth had gone to Ivy League schools.",
      "But envy may play a role, as well. Obama\u2019s prize was a sore point for Trump, said Bolton and another former senior White House official from the first term.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with the fact that Mr. Obama got it and he didn\u2019t,\u201d the ex-official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Even before the extraordinary Oval Office bust-up between President Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, relations between Washington and Europe were fraying dramatically.",
      "Now \u2014 after Friday\u2019s diplomatic implosion between Trump, the Ukrainian president and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 it\u2019s not clear what the way back could be for the trans-Atlantic alliance built over the past 80 years.",
      "European leaders lined up to support Zelenskyy in an effective rebuke to Trump, who told his Ukrainian counterpart he was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cgambling with World War III\u201d by defending his country against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201cdignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. \u201cBe strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Zelenskyy. We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, wrote that \u201cwe must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\u201d While French President Emmanuel Macron said it was essential to respect the Ukrainians \u201cfighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe.\u201d",
      "Perhaps most strikingly, European Union foreign minister Kaja Kallas said, \u201cToday it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It\u2019s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.\u201d",
      "Not everyone agreed of course. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban posted that during the \u201cdifficult\u201d Oval Office meeting, Trump \u201cstood bravely for peace.\u201d And other observers faulted Zelenskyy for his part in the exchange, saying he unnecessarily and publicly increased the temperature with a far more senior negotiating partner on which he relies.",
      "But for Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters, these European figures so passionately defend Ukraine because they see it as far more than an internecine conflict raging in the frigid fields of Eastern Europe.",
      "Putin\u2019s invasion is part of a far larger hybrid war, they say, from the Ukrainian battlefield to cyberattacks on Western democracy. They fear that giving the Kremlin a symbolic win in Ukraine may only embolden Russia to expand this assault elsewhere. Doubly so when they accuse Trump of undermining the alliance by barracking its allies and cozying up to Putin, widely reviled in Europe as a war criminal.",
      "This strength of feeling explains why trans-Atlantic relations were splintering before Friday\u2019s undiplomatic scenes. In fact, for the past few weeks, there have been increasing signs that European powers have finally decided to break free from their postwar dependence on the U.S.",
      "\u201cMy absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.,\u201d said Merz after his center-right Christian Democratic Union party won the German election Sunday. He questioned whether NATO\u2019s June summit would still see the alliance \u201cin its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly.\u201d",
      "It was a jaw-dropping statement from a conservative Americanophile, signaling not just a willingness to spend more on defense, a common Trump demand, but a desire to go it alone.",
      "\u201cI never thought I would have to say such a thing on a television program,\u201d he said.",
      "There are myriad uncertainties about how all this might work. Would Europe\u2019s newfound military independence mean spending parity with the U.S. within NATO? Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for example, say they have no desire to reduce their cooperation with Washington. Or would American involvement on the continent diminish or even vanish altogether?",
      "Either way, the scale of the challenge is vast. The U.S. military is so deeply ingrained in Europe that its removal would leave \u201chuge holes\u201d in air defense, military satellites and cyberspace, said Sven Biscop, a director at the Egmont Institute, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Since World War II, the U.S. has agreed to protect Europe\u2019s declining militaries against Russia on the understanding that in return it has been able to spread hard and soft American power through the continent and beyond. Unpicking this symbiosis will take hundreds of billions of dollars, likely footed by European taxpayers already embroiled in a cost-of-living crisis and cuts to public services.",
      "The combined E.U. defense budget of last year, $457 billion, was dwarfed by that of the U.S., $968 billion. Russia\u2019s total, $462 billion, was also larger, despite its far smaller economy, having retooled its entire economy on a war footing since invading Ukraine three years ago.",
      "It will take \u201cfive years as a minimum\u201d for Europe to \u201cfully deter Russia without any U.S. contribution,\u201d said Luigi Scazzieri, assistant director at the Centre for European Reform, a London think tank. \u201cYou can probably get something that fills a large part of the gap in two to three years \u2014 but only with a lot of urgency.\u201d",
      "Regardless of those practical mountains, Merz\u2019s comments showed an \u201cunderstanding that we are in a new era of trans-Atlantic relations,\u201d said Sophia Besch, a senior Europe fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank.",
      "The Trump administration \u201cno longer acknowledges shared community of values, shared interests, and puts forward a very \u2018great power competition\u2019 view of the world, where Europe is a side player and Russia is an equal,\u201d Besch said.",
      "The German leader-apparent is far from alone. He has a fellow traveler in Macron, who for years has argued Europe needs to end its reliance on Washington. \u201cWe are experiencing a historic moment,\u201d he said Monday in response to Merz\u2019s overtures. \u201cIt can lead to an unprecedented Franco-German agreement.\u201d",
      "Biscop believes that these leaders need to form something akin to a European \u201cwar Cabinet\u201d around which to organize this newfound autonomy. Joining them, he believes, should be Britain\u2019s Starmer, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and the E.U.\u2019s von der Leyen.",
      "\u201cThey need agility and they need to move fast,\u201d he said. \u201cEven faster on Ukraine \u2014 because the Americans and Russians are already negotiating.\u201d"

      "Pope Francis\u2019 condition suffered a \u201csudden worsening\u201d Friday afternoon after \u201can isolated crisis of bronchospasm,\u201d but the Vatican later said the crisis was over and that he was resting in good spirits.",
      "The 88-year-old pontiff spent the morning undergoing respiratory physiotherapy and praying in the chapel.",
      "In the early afternoon, he suffered the bronchospasm, which \u201cresulted in an episode of vomiting with inhalation and sudden worsening of the respiratory picture.\u201d",
      "A bronchospasm is when the muscles in the bronchi, the airways that connect the lungs to the windpipe, tighten and cause airways to narrow, limiting the intake of oxygen, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "He was bronchoaspirated and given noninvasive mechanical ventilation, which he responded well to, the Vatican said.",
      "Throughout the ordeal he remained alert and oriented.\u00a0His prognosis \u201cremains reserved.\u201d",
      "The Holy Father has been hospitalized since Feb. 14. He was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital for bronchitis and is now receiving care for double pneumonia, meaning pneumonia in both lungs.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of $60 billion in U.S. Agency for International Development contracts is already unraveling significant programs and caused profound harm to many of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, humanitarian officials tell NBC News.",
      "The pace of change has jumped since Wednesday, when the White House unveiled plans to cut more than 90% of contracts held by USAID, which has been the world\u2019s largest single aid provider for decades. In January, an official freeze on foreign aid was cast as part of a temporary review.",
      "The recently announced cuts essentially eliminate most U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad and come amid the dramatic contraction of government spending carried out under the aegis of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. President Donald Trump and Musk allege that USAID promotes a liberal agenda and wastes money.",
      "Some of the programs at risk support drought-prone populations in Africa, school feeding programs in West Africa, outreach to youth at risk of recruitment to extremist organizations like the Islamic State group, and public health efforts focused on HIV/AIDS, according to multiple officials familiar with the cuts.",
      "Several representatives for nongovernmental organizations that have been affected by the USAID cuts requested anonymity to speak to NBC News while they determined how to best work with the Trump administration and dealt with the devastating directive. One spokesperson said they were afraid they could lose funding for the few remaining programs that weren\u2019t hit by Wednesday\u2019s cuts while another hoped the administration would reconsider the cuts altogether.",
      "UNAIDS, the joint United Nations program responding to HIV/AIDS globally, on Friday said it had received a letter from the administration terminating funding with immediate effect. The U.S. has been the leading contributor through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known at PEPFAR, which has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives in 55 countries since its creation in 2003, according to UNAIDS.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. funding cuts are dismantling the system,\u201d International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cHIV treatment is crumbling. TB services are collapsing. No data means no tracking of who\u2019s in care. No counsellors, no HIV testing \u2014 even in hospitals. No outreach means people fall through the cracks. Services for the most vulnerable people, including mobile clinics and drop-in centres, are shut down. Lives are on the line.\u201d",
      "Organizations combating gender-based violence are also feeling immediate impact. The International Rescue Committee, which supports civilians impacted by humanitarian crises around the world, including by providing medical care, counseling and legal assistance to thousands in war-torn Sudan, has been forced to shut down some of its operations, according to its president.",
      "\u201cHumanitarian services and lifesaving assistance in Sudan, the world\u2019s world humanitarian crisis on record, have been shut down. The programs affected include services for children with acute malnutrition, putting them at risk,\u201d said IRC President and CEO David Miliband said in a statement shared with NBC News.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator-designate at USAID, \u201chave determined your award is not aligned with Agency priorities and made a determination that continuing this program is not in the national interest,\u201d according to a copy of a termination notice obtained by NBC News that was sent to companies with USAID contracts Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere seems to be no pattern to it\u201d other than shutting down U.S. foreign aid, one humanitarian official said.",
      "USAID provided assistance to around 130 countries in fiscal year 2023. The top 10 recipients of aid in that year were Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria.",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations International Organization for Migration told NBC News that the cuts directly affect the organization\u2019s \u201cability to support some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is fighting two lawsuits challenging the dissolution of USAID and the subsequent freeze on foreign aid. One of those suits has reached the Supreme Court, with the court on Wednesday temporarily pausing a lower court order that required the administration to release frozen foreign aid funding by midnight Wednesday.",
      "There will likely be more lawsuits against the administration as a result of the termination notices, with organizations on the hook for work that\u2019s already been done, and potentially costs to wind down these programs, while the USAID payment system remains shut down.",
      "DAI, a USAID-funded international development organization that says it works in 160 countries, received termination notices for more than 90% of its contracts.",
      "As a result, the group has been forced to furlough 500 employees, according to spokesman Steven O\u2019Connor. Not only that, the government still owes DAI for work already delivered, he said.",
      "\u201cWe prefinance all that work, then we invoice the government for reimbursement; without that reimbursement, we can\u2019t pay our staff, our partners, our vendors, our creditors,\u201d he said.",
      "In the meantime, the effects are already being felt in communities that rely on that assistance for emergency relief, with trust potentially eroding between those communities and USAID and its partner organizations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard to drive this truck in reverse, because they\u2019ve washed out the road behind us,\u201d a humanitarian official said."
