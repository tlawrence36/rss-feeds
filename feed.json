      "Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d at the Santa Fe Opera House",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre.\u201d",
      "Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge.",
      "And indeed the part of Wotan, one of the most demanding roles in opera for a dramatic bass-baritone, seems to inspire mountain imagery. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it \u201cthe Mount Everest for this particular voice type.\u201d To Green, \u201cIt feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.\u201d",
      "Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he\u2019s come.",
      "Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would happen, that my career would blow up the way it has,\u201d Green said in an interview between performances, which continue through Aug. 21.",
      "The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d the second of the four operas in Wagner\u2019s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods.",
      "It calls for a wide dramatic range \u2014 from exuberance, to despair, from fury to compassion. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson.",
      "\u201cMy Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m getting my first whack at it at 39.\u201d",
      "Even in this first outing, his performance drew bravos from the audience and critics.",
      "\u201cGreen \u2026 portrayed the troubled god as if he had been doing it for years,\u201d wrote Harvey Steiman on Seen and Heard International. \u201cSensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.\u201d",
      "Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of \u201cDas Rheingold,\u201d the opening \u201cRing\u201d installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment he walked onstage, everyone sensed his God-like presence,\u201d Dudamel said in an email to the AP. \u201cWhen he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn\u2019t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.\u201d",
      "Green will perform the \u201cWalk\u00fcre\u201d Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new \u201cRing\u201d cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP.",
      "Among his colleagues, Green is known for his relentless work ethic and perfectionism.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s extremely hard on himself,\u201d said Gaffigan, who is conducting the Santa Fe performances and recalled the first time he heard from Green after he was cast.",
      "\u201cHe called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,\u201d Gaffigan said, \u201cAnd from the first words on the telephone, he said, \u2018I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?\u2019 \u2026 I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn\u2019t give up on getting this time.",
      "\u201cThe dedication to the text and the music and the rhythms is at the highest level of preparation I\u2019ve heard in a long time,\u201d Gaffigan added. \u201cHe knows how serious this is. It\u2019s a major ascent in his career.\u201d",
      "Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt was the Second Knight in \u2018Parsifal\u2019 ... and I was rehearsing for three months for a role that literally has 61 seconds of music,\u201d Green said..",
      "\u201cI was like, this is at the Met, I need to be perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of mentality has been my saving grace, because I put everything I\u2019ve got into it, vocally, physically, mentally.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Kristin Scott Thomas draws on her own childhood losses for her directorial debut \u201cMy Mother's Wedding.\u201d",
      "Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. Both were Royal Navy pilots who died in crashes. The first happened when she was 5. The second at age 11. Thomas uses these facts, a kind of origin story, as the basis for her directorial debut, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a comedic drama about family, trauma and getting on with it that opens in theaters Friday.",
      "Knowing that the story comes from a real place is important for the experience. It gives \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a perfectly average film that doesn\u2019t quite land the way it should, an emotional depth that it\u2019s otherwise lacking. This is a strange shortcoming considering the caliber of the cast, including Thomas as the bride to be, and Sienna Miller, Emily Beecham and Scarlett Johansson as her daughters. But it\u2019s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren\u2019t guarantees that a movie will work.",
      "In the film, the deaths may be in the distant past, but they continue to haunt Diana\u2019s (Thomas) adult daughters as she prepares to marry another. Diana\u2019s new man is not a dashing pilot, forever preserved in handsome youth. Geoffrey (James Fleet) is very gray. He likes to talk about birds, ospreys in particular, has never had children and comes with a very silly last name (Loveglove) that she plans to take. Her girls are not exactly impressed, though they\u2019ve all got their own stuff to deal with.",
      "It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I\u2019ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she\u2019s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto).",
      "Miller\u2019s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest \u201cDame Of Darkness\u201d is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. And Beecham is the youngest Georgina, a nurse who suspects that her husband is having an affair. To find out, the girls hire a private detective to surveil her house and show them the footage after the wedding.",
      "It's a very busy, fraught weekend for everyone. There\u2019s lots of fretting over why Katherine won\u2019t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. There\u2019s lingering anxiety about their mom marrying this man who seems so unlike the two heroes that came before and much discussion about the importance of last names, marriage and making sure kids feel like they belong to someone. Some things get resolved, but it's hard to shake the feeling that everyone might need a new therapist by the end.",

      "The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said.

      "Zach Cregger says he had to stop writing jokes while creating his latest horror film, \u201cWeapons,\" and instead let the hyper realistic aftermath of tragedy drive the movie's humor",
      "LOS ANGELES -- If there\u2019s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie \u201cWeapons,\u201d it\u2019s that the best laughs won\u2019t come from the jokes he writes.",
      "The film follows Cregger\u2019s 2022 solo directorial debut \u201cBarbarians,\u201d the widely celebrated genre-bending horror. This time, the young director bends even more, spinning a town into chaos when all children but one from the same classroom mysteriously vanish, leaving a trail of questions in their place.",
      "The Warner Bros. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious \u2014 a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIf the humor is coming from an authentic reaction that a character\u2019s having, then it works,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes that didn\u2019t make it into the movie that I thought were going to be so funny. And then we did a test screening, and nobody laughed and I\u2019m like, OK, it\u2019s gotta go.\u201d",
      "Paranoia runs deep in the film. The town's heartbroken parents are represented by Josh Brolin\u2019s character, Archer, whose son was among the missing. The students\u2019 teacher, played by Julia Garner, is determined to solve the mystery, despite parents blaming her for the disappearances.",
      "The humor here comes naturally, Cregger said, as characters navigate the absurd events happening around them.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not playing for the laugh, otherwise you lose the laugh,\u201d said Brolin, whose character stumbles through his grief, a state ripe for what he called genuine and \u201cembarrassingly funny\u201d moments.",
      "If 17 kids up and ran out of their homes at 2:17 a.m. one morning with no trace, what would a community do? That question drove \u201cWeapons,\u201d painting a picture of a town left reeling by the mystery.",
      "The film setting \u2014 the fictional small town of Maybrook, Illinois \u2014 is just as integral to the plot as any of its main characters. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie\u2019s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are \u201copposite side of the same coin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because this isn\u2019t even like a proper horror film,\u201d Garner said. \u201cIt has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it\u2019s kind of its own genre, in a way.\u201d",
      "The town\u2019s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Parents are outraged, storming into town halls and angrily demanding answers from the police, the school and, most pointedly, the students\u2019 teacher. Yet, when Garner\u2019s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage.",

      "The body-swappers are back",
      "It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 or at least, a tale Hollywood loves to tell again and again: Body-swapping. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s comical. It carries heartwarming messages about walking in another\u2019s shoes, and learning about oneself along the way.",
      "So it\u2019s hardly surprising that \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the 2003 version of the 1972 Mary Rodgers novel starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, was a hit. Lohan was endearing and charismatic as an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager, and Curtis was a comic hoot as her control-freak therapist mom.",
      "And while there were a few misfires \u2014 the stereotypical Asian representation has aged badly \u2014 the film was powered by an easy chemistry between the two stars. So why not revisit the story in 2025? Sequels are often made for far less compelling reasons.",
      "The chief weakness of \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d \u2014 which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. The comedy is thus a bit more manic, and the plot machinations more overwrought (or sometimes distractingly silly).",
      "Then there's the double body-swapping. Because one major swap isn't enough, here we have two sets of swappers \u2014 a quixotic quartet of lives disrupted during the lead-up to, yes, another wedding! The problem is that sometimes, it\u2019s actually hard to keep track of who\u2019s inhabiting whom, and therefore why they're doing what.",
      "Not to say that \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d directed with gusto by Nisha Ganatra, doesn't have moments of comic glee. I\u2019ll admit to laughing out loud \u2014 with everyone else older than 30 near me \u2014 when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s like a database of old people!\u201d Touch\u00e9, guys.",
      "These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are actually Lohan and Curtis, playing ninth-graders trapped in adult bodies. Before we get to that, though: We begin 22 years after we last saw Lohan\u2019s Anna, playing electric guitar at her mom's wedding. Now a single mom herself with a job managing a young pop star, she's trying to get her daughter up for school. Harper (the excellent Julia Butters) is \u2014 surprise! \u2014 an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager. And just like Anna two decades ago, she keeps people out of her bedroom. \u201cPrepare to be triggered!\u201d Anna yells before barging in. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.)",
      "Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is \u201cRebelling with Respect.\u201d Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out \u201cMake good choices!\u201d \u2014 just what mom Tess used to say, natch.",
      "At school, Harper butts heads with transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), a budding fashion designer who hails from Britain and is very snooty. Anna is called to see the principal. There, she meets Lily\u2019s dishy chef dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and the two flirt so intensely, the principal herself makes them a dinner reservation.",
      "All it takes is one cute dating montage, and poof, Anna and Eric are engaged. But things are still bad between Harper and Lily, whose animosity triggers a weirdly violent, all-school food fight on bake sale day. But they all have a bachelorette party to attend. There, a wacky fortune-teller and barista and business-card maker \u2014 Vanessa Bayer, in a cameo that perhaps, no definitely goes on too long \u2014 reads their palms. And then the earth starts shaking.",
      "\u201cFreaky\u201d fans know what happens next. The four awaken the next morning, each inhabiting someone else. Anna is Harper. Tess is Lily. Harper is Anna. Lily is Tess. We\u2019ll be testing you on this later!",

She\u2019s flirting with Jake (Chad Michael Murray) \u2014 yes, the hunky guy from the original \u2014 and her flirting is so weird, Jake thinks she's having a stroke.",

Will the sisters-to-be reach an understanding? Will Lohan get to play the electric guitar? Will everyone grow to appreciate each other?",

Then, Combs invited Zimmerman to perform at his Hurricane Helene relief benefit \u201cConcert for Carolina.\u201d They hit it off, and the rest is history.

In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records.

      "Police said they also found in his apartment a psychiatric medication, an epilepsy drug and an anti-inflammatory that had been prescribed to Tamura.",
      "His psychiatric history would not have prevented him from legally purchasing the revolver, unless relatives or law enforcement sought a so-called extreme risk protection order from the courts. However, a new state law effective this month will allow officers to confiscate firearms in the immediate vicinity of someone placed on a mental health crisis hold.",
      "Las Vegas police also released records Tuesday related to two other run-ins with the law. Tamura was arrested for trespassing at a casino in 2023, where he became agitated after he was asked to show his ID to collect his winnings and was asked to leave when he refused to. He was also cited for driving an unregistered car and without a license in 2024.",

      "It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?",
      "This is \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d \u2014 the gnawing sense that one\u2019s life should have an overarching purpose, but it\u2019s unclear how to discover it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,\u201d said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.",
      "The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?",
      "Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help \u201cclose that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,\u201d he said.",
      "People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.",
      "There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.",
      "But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.",
      "The term \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a \u201cpurposeful life.\u201d It is, she said in one interview, \u201cthe formula we\u2019ve all been fed.\u201d",
      "People have always searched for life\u2019s meaning and purpose.",
      "\u201cPart of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,\u201d said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of \u201cLiving the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut a lot of the places that we\u2019ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.\u201d",
      "Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).",
      "Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don\u2019t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.",
      "As Steger said, \u201cnow we\u2019re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.\"",

      "Better, he said, to focus on little \u201cp\u201d purpose and pursuits that some might simply call hobbies \u2014 gardening, singing, collecting baseball cards. Or it can be found in a job, or volunteering.",

      "It\u2019s not just for self-improvement, he said. When people do something they love, they attract people to them, which can help create communities.",

      "Research shows mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "WASHINGTON -- So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis.",
      "But this week, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, canceled $500 million in government-funded research projects to create new mRNA vaccines against respiratory illnesses that might trigger another health emergency.",
      "That dismays infectious disease experts who note that mRNA allows faster production of shots than older vaccine-production methods, buying precious time if another pandemic were to emerge.",
      "Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to \u201cmake enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world,\" said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. But using mRNA technology \u201ccould change that dramatically, such that by the end of the first year, we could vaccinate the world.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses called proteins \u2014 often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs \u2014 and then purifying them. Injecting a small dose as a vaccine trains the body how to recognize when a real infection hits so it's ready to fight back.",
      "But that technology takes a long time. Using mRNA is a faster process.",
      "The \u201cm\u201d stands for messenger, meaning mRNA carries instructions for our bodies to make proteins. Scientists figured out how to harness that natural process by making mRNA in a lab.",
      "They take a snippet of that genetic code that carries instructions for making the protein they want the vaccine to target. Injecting that snippet instructs the body to become its own mini-vaccine factory, making enough copies of the protein for the immune system to recognize and react.",
      "Years of research show protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 both the types made with mRNA and a type made with traditional technology \u2014 does wane over time. The vaccinations provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected.",

      "Today's COVID-19 vaccines made with mRNA by Pfizer and Moderna can be updated more quickly each year than traditional types, an advantage that now has multiple companies developing other vaccines using the technology.",
      "Osterholm counts about 15 infectious disease vaccines that could benefit from mRNA technology, but that's not the only potential. Many disease therapies take aim at proteins, making mRNA a potential technique for developing new treatments. Researchers already are testing an mRNA-based therapeutic vaccine for pancreatic cancer.

      "Three new studies highlight the severe health impacts of recent wildfires on Maui and in Los Angeles",
      "NEW YORK -- The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.",
      "Two of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.",
      "The Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.",
      "The study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.",
      "The studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \"a really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.",
      "The results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.",
      "How to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.",
      "\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.",
      "One of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.",
      "Patz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d",
      "Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington echoed that, noting that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic than standard air pollution.",

      "Jonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii's four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That's a significant increase, Ebi said.",
      "They also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.",
      "The increases did not last: Rates fells in the following months, the researchers found.",
      "The third study was led by researchers in Finland. They used mathematical modeling to estimate that there were 440 more deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1 than what would normally have been expected, and said those are related to the fires.",

      "An inmate executed by Tennessee without deactivating his implanted defibrillator said he was in serious pain after the lethal injection started",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A man convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two young daughters in the 1980s said he was \u201churting so bad\u201d while he was given a lethal injection Tuesday in Tennessee, where authorities had refused to deactivate his implanted defibrillator despite claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks as the drugs were administered.",
      "Black's attorney said they will review data kept by the device as part of an autopsy.",
      "Black died at 10:43 a.m., prison officials said. It was about 10 minutes after the execution started and Black talked about being in pain.",
      "Asked for any last words, he replied, \u201cNo sir.\u201d",
      "Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. All seven media witnesses to the execution agreed he appeared to be in discomfort. Throughout the execution, a spiritual adviser prayed and sang over Black, at one point touching his face.",
      "\u201cOh, it's hurting so bad,\" Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm.",
      "\u201cI'm so sorry. Just listen to my voice,\u201d the adviser responded.",
      "Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to turn off his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. Black, 69, was in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said.",
      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said it\u2019s unaware of any other cases with similar claims to Black\u2019s about ICDs or pacemakers. Black\u2019s attorneys said they haven\u2019t found a comparable case, either.",
      "Black was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of his girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya Clay, 9, and Lakeisha Clay, 6. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting Clay\u2019s estranged husband.",
      "Clay's sister said Black will now face a higher power.",
      "\u201cHis family is now going through the same thing we went through 37 years ago. I can't say I\u2019m sorry because we never got an apology,\" Linette Bell, Angela Clay's sister, said in a statement read by a victim's advocate after the execution.",
      "Black's lawyer said the execution was shameful.",
      "\u201cToday, the state of Tennessee killed a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in a violation of the laws of our country simply because they could,\" attorney Kelley Henry said.",
      "In mid-July, a trial court judge agreed with Black\u2019s attorneys that officials must have the defibrillator deactivated to avert the risk that it could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution. But Tennessee's Supreme Court overturned that decision Thursday, saying the other judge lacked authority to order the change.",
      "The state disputed that the lethal injection would cause Black\u2019s defibrillator to shock him and said he wouldn\u2019t feel them regardless.",

      "Henry said Black's defense team will carefully review autopsy results, EKG data from Black and information from the defibrillator to determine what exactly happened during the execution. The lethal injection protocol is still being challenged in court.",
      "She said she was especially concerned about his head movement and complaints of pain because the massive dose of pentobarbital used to kill inmates is supposed to rapidly leave them unconscious.",
      "\u201cThe fact that he was able to raise his head several times and express pain tells you that the pentobarbital was not acting the way the state's experts claim it acts,\u201d Henry said.",
      "Prison officials did not comment on witnesses and Black\u2019s attorney saying he appeared conscious or his complaints of pain.",
      "It was Tennessee\u2019s second execution since May, after a pause for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by state corrections officials.",
      "Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. The number of executions this year exceeds the 25 carried out last year and in 2018. It is the highest total since 2015, when 28 people were put to death.",
      "Black had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, which is a small, battery-powered electronic device that is surgically implanted in the chest. It served as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. Black\u2019s attorneys have said a doctor can send it a deactivation command without surgery.",
      "The legal case also spurred a reminder that most medical professionals consider participation in executions a violation of health care ethics.",
      "In recent years, Black's legal team has unsuccessfully tried to get a new hearing about an intellectual disability they say he's exhibited since childhood. People with intellectual disabilities are constitutionally barred from execution.",
      "His attorneys have said that if they had delayed a prior attempt to seek his intellectual disability claim, he would have been spared under a 2021 state law. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it \u201con the merits.\"",
      "A judge denied Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk's attempt to get Black a new hearing. Funk focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn\u2019t meet the criteria for what was then called \"mental retardation.\u201d But she concluded that Black met the new law\u2019s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.",

    "story": [
      "The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical \u2013 families need basics like food and water more than vaccines. Others are simply unfounded \u2013 the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.",
      "Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren\u2019t always stored correctly, she added.",
      "\u201cIn many places, our work is not done with honesty,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication \u2014 a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported in Pakistanand Afghanistan. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",
      "Worker Ayaz described \u201cfake finger marking\u201d \u2014 placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.",
      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",
      "WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.",
      "Eradication demands near-perfection \u2013 zero polio cases and immunizing more than 95% of children.",

But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.",
      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",
      "Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",

      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",
      "Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.",
      "In Karachi, locals told AP they didn\u2019t understand the government\u2019s fixation on polio and complained of other issues \u2014 dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",
      "\u201cIt results in disability,\u201d said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. \u201cThey are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.\u201d",
      "Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like measles or tuberculosis, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the share of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to federal data posted Thursday.",
      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",

      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "The conservative's abrupt and poorly planned power grab on Dec. 3 came during a seemingly routine standoff with the liberals, whom he described as \u201canti-state\u201d forces abusing their legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. Some political opponents have questioned whether Yoon's actions were at least partly motivated by growing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.",

In 2018, military prosecutors charged Iliescu with crimes against humanity for failing to prevent \u201cnumerous situations\u201d in which civilians were needlessly killed during the revolution.",
      "Prosecutors alleged he had spread false information through state media, creating a \u201cgeneralized psychosis\u201d that fueled chaos and bloodshed. The charges refer to a five-day period during the uprising, after Ceausescu fled Bucharest on Dec. 22, 1989. At the time of Iliescu\u2019s death, he had never been convicted, and the case remained open.",

      "Dodik\u2019s lawyers have announced that they will seek a temporary measure postponing the implementation of the verdict, and announced an appeal to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina.",
      "The appeals court in Bosnia-Herzegovina confirmed Friday an earlier court ruling that sentenced the pro-Russia Bosnian Serb leader to one year in prison and handed a six-year ban on political activity. As a result, his mandate as Bosnian Serb president was revoked.",
      "Dodik rejected the court ruling and added that he will continue to act as Bosnian Serb president as long as he has the support of the Bosnian Serb parliament. He also received support from populist Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic as well as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.",
      "The Bosnian Serb government said it does not accept the court ruling because it is \u201cunconstitutional and politically motivated.\u201d",
      "The European Union said last week that the \u201cverdict is binding and must be respected.\u201d Bosnia is a candidate for EU membership but has been told by Brussels to strengthen the rule of law. Dodik\u2019s separatist and pro-Russian activities stalled Bosnia\u2019s progress toward EU membership.",

      "The Associated Press explores the human toll of Sept. 17, 2024, when thousands of pagers distributed to the Hezbollah group blew up across Lebanon, remotely detonated by Israel",
      "BAZOURIEH, Lebanon -- Her head heavy with a cold, Sarah Jaffal woke up late and shuffled into the kitchen. The silence of the apartment was pierced by the unfamiliar buzzing of a pager lying near a table.",
      "Annoyed but curious, the 21-year-old picked up the device belonging to a family member. She saw a message: \u201cError,\u201d then \u201cPress OK.\u201d",
      "Jaffal didn\u2019t have time to respond. She didn't even hear the explosion.",
      "\u201cSuddenly everything went dark,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt I was in a whirlpool.\u201d She was in and out of consciousness for hours, blood streaming from her mouth, excruciating pain in her fingertips.",
      "At that moment on Sept. 17, 2024, thousands of pagers distributed to the Hezbollah group were blowing up in homes, offices, shops and on frontlines across Lebanon, remotely detonated by Israel. Hezbollah had been firing rockets into Israel almost daily for nearly a year in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "After years of planning, Israel had infiltrated the supply chain of Hezbollah, the most powerful of Iran\u2019s armed proxies in the Middle East. It used shell companies to sell the rigged devices to commercial associates of Hezbollah in an operation aimed at disrupting the Iran-backed group\u2019s communication networks and harming and disorienting its members.",
      "The pager attack was stunning in its scope. It wounded more than 3,000 people and killed 12, including two children.",
      "Israel boasts of it as a show of its technological and intelligence prowess. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently presented U.S. President Donald Trump with a golden pager as a gift.",
      "Human rights and United Nations reports, however, say the attack may have violated international law, calling it indiscriminate.",
      "Hezbollah, also a major Shiite political party with a wide network of social institutions, has acknowledged that most of those wounded and killed were its fighters or personnel. The simultaneous explosions in populated areas, however, also wounded many civilians like Jaffal, who was one of four women along with 71 men who received medical treatment in Iran. Hezbollah won't say how many civilians were hurt, but says most were relatives of the group's personnel or workers in Hezbollah-linked institutions, including hospitals.",
      "Ten months later, survivors are on a slow, painful path to recovery. They are easily identifiable, with missing eyes, faces laced with scars, hands with missing fingers \u2014 signs of the moment when they checked the buzzing devices. The scars also mark them as a likely Hezbollah member or a dependent.",
      "For weeks after the attack, The Associated Press attempted to reach survivors, who stayed out of the public eye. Many spent weeks outside Lebanon for medical treatment. Most in the group\u2019s tight-knit community remained quiet while Hezbollah investigated the massive security breach.",
      "The AP also contacted Hezbollah and its association treating those affected by the attacks to see if they could facilitate contacts. The group, at war with Israel for decades, is also one of the most powerful political factions in Lebanon, with members holding nearly 10% of parliament seats and two ministerial posts. It has its own security apparatus and offers extensive health, religious and other social and commercial services in southern and eastern Lebanon and parts of Beirut.",
      "A representative of Hezbollah\u2019s Association of Wounded did share with AP the contacts of eight people who had expressed readiness to share their stories. The AP independently contacted them, and six agreed to be interviewed. They included Jaffal and another woman, two 12-year-old children and two men, one a preacher, the other a fighter.",
      "All are family members of Hezbollah officials or fighters. All lost fingers. Shrapnel lodged under their skin. The men were blinded. The women and children each lost one eye, with the other damaged.",
      "There were no minders present, and no questions were off-limits. Some declined to answer questions about the identity or role of the pager\u2019s owner, identifying them only as relatives.",
      "The hours of interviews offered a rare glimpse into the attack's human toll. Survivors described how the incessantly buzzing pagers exploded when picked up, whether they pressed a button or not. Some said their ears still ring from the blast.",
      "\u201dI\u2019ve put up with so much pain I never imagined I could tolerate,\u201d said Jaffal, a university graduate.",
      "The survivors expressed ongoing support for Hezbollah but acknowledged the security breach. They blamed Israel for their wounds.",
      "Rights groups have argued the attack was indiscriminate because the pagers detonated in populated areas, and it was nearly impossible to know who was holding the devices or where they were when they exploded. The preacher, Mustafa Choeib, recalled that his two young daughters used to play with his pager and he sometimes found it among their toys.",
      "Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency declined to comment on AP questions about those allegations. But Israeli security officials have rejected that the attack was indiscriminate, saying the pagers were exclusively sold to Hezbollah members and that tests were conducted to ensure that only the person holding the pager would be harmed.",
      "The pagers were the opening strike in an Israeli campaign that would cripple Hezbollah.",
      "The day after the pager bombings, Hezbollah walkie-talkies exploded in another Israeli attack that killed at least 25 people and injured over 600, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. Israel then launched a campaign of airstrikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and hundreds of other militants and civilians. The war ended with a ceasefire  in November.",
      "Nine months later, Israel stunned and weakened Iran with a campaign of airstrikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites, senior military officials and symbols of the Islamic Republic\u2019s grip.",
      "Hezbollah, meanwhile, has been left reeling. Besides the military blow, the group is left with the financial and psychological burden of thousands who need long-term medical treatment and recovery.",
      "Pagers are widely seen as outdated, but they were a main part of Hezbollah\u2019s communication network. Nasrallah had repeatedly warned against cellphones. Israel could easily track them, he said.",
      "With old pagers breaking down, the group ordered new ones. Israel sold the rigged devices through shell companies.",
      "According to a Hezbollah official, the group had ordered 15,000 pagers. Only 8,000 arrived, and nearly half were distributed to members. Others destined for Lebanon were intercepted in Turkey days after the attack when Hezbollah tipped off officials there.",
      "Hezbollah's investigation into how its communications networks were infiltrated found that the purchase of the rigged pagers resulted from negligence, and its officials were cleared of suspicions of collaborating with Israel, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the probe.",
      "Some Hezbollah members had complained the new pagers were too bulky. Some didn\u2019t use them because batteries died quickly or heated up.",

      "His teeth were blown out. His grandmother picked them off the couch, along with the tip of his nose.",
      "\u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d said his mother, Faten Haidar.",

      "He wears glasses now. Pink scars crisscross his face and his reconstructed nose. He spends more time with other children injured like him, and only goes to school for exams. Dheini can\u2019t go swimming with his father, since sea or river water could harm his wounds.",
      "\u201cBefore, I used to spend a lot of time on my phone. I used to run and go to school,\u201d the boy said. \u201cNow I go to Beirut\u201d for treatment.",

      "Everybody wants to save money. Buying a lightly used car instead of a new car is one way to do that. Choosing a fuel-efficient hybrid model is another way. Combine those approaches, and you might be surprised to discover what you can drive even when you\u2019re on a tight budget. The five hybrid sedans listed below in alphabetical order are worthy of consideration due to their low prices, great EPA-estimated fuel economy, and favorable crash test ratings. Edmunds\u2019 automotive experts think they\u2019re the best used hybrid sedans for under $25,000.",
      "Thanks to its spacious back seat and large trunk, the Honda Accord Hybrid can easily accommodate a family of four or five, making it an ideal car for summer road trips and big-box shopping excursions. This midsize sedan\u2019s model lineup ranges from basic to sporty or luxurious, and depending on the version, you can expect EPA-estimated combined fuel economy of between 43 mpg and 48 mpg. Favorable crash test ratings are a bonus.",
      "Look for: Honda added a Sport trim level in 2022. A redesign for 2023 brought a more sophisticated and refined version of Honda\u2019s hybrid powertrain, which became standard on all higher-priced Accords that year.",
      "2018-2024 Honda Accord Hybrid pricing (under 50,000 miles): approximately $19,000-$25,000",
      "If the Accord Hybrid is too large, consider the smaller Insight sedan as an alternative. It gets better gas mileage, comfortably accommodates four people, and boasts a trunk as spacious as the trunks of some midsize cars. Honda based this version of the Insight on the popular Civic sedan, giving the Insight different styling and a more upscale-feeling interior. According to EPA combined estimates, you can expect 48 mpg to 52 mpg, depending on which trim level you choose. The Insight also boasts exceptionally good crash test ratings.",

      "2019-2022 Honda Insight pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $21,000 to $25,000",
      "Aside from its distinctive styling and impressive technology, what helps the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid stand apart is its dual-clutch automatic transmission. That design eliminates the typical acceleration drone common to hybrids, making the Elantra more satisfying to drive. It doesn\u2019t negatively impact fuel economy either. According to EPA combined estimates, this reasonably roomy compact car averages 50-54 mpg.",
      "Look for: The Blue trim level offers the best fuel economy. In 2024, Hyundai updated the styling, added more driver assist features, and improved the infotainment system.",
      "2021-2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $18,000 to $25,000",
      "Toyota has been building Camry Hybrids for nearly two decades, and the car has earned a reputation for efficiency and longevity. Since 2018, a sense of style has also been a part of the recipe, and with the SE and XSE trim levels, there are hints of sportiness. The Camry isn\u2019t the roomiest midsize sedan available, but its EPA estimates of 46 mpg to 52 mpg, track record of durability, and impressive crash test ratings help make up for that.",

In 2023, Toyota expanded the lineup to include sporty SE and upscale XLE versions and also enhanced the powertrain, driver assist systems, and infotainment technology.

      "\u201cThis decision is difficult, but a necessary one,\u201d Chris Cramer, CEO of Claire\u2019s, said in a press release issued Wednesday. \u201cIncreased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire\u2019s and its stakeholders.\u201d",
      "Like many retailers, Claire's was also struggling with higher costs tied to President Donald Trump's tariff plans, analysts said.",
      "Cramer said that the company remains in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with potential strategic and financial partners. He noted that the company remains committed to serving its customers and partnering with its suppliers and landlords in other regions. Claire\u2019s also intends to continue paying employees' wages and benefits, and it will seek approval to use cash collateral to support its operations.",

      "In December Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed her earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.",
      "At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package.",
      "That pay package carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla\u2019s stock price.",
      "Musk appealed the order in March. A month later Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it was creating a special committee to look at Musk\u2019s compensation as CEO.",
      "Wedbush analyst Dan Ives feels Musk's stock award may alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns.",
      "\u201cWe believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,\u201d Ives wrote in a client note. \u201cMusk remains Tesla\u2019s big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.\u201d",

      "China has taken a firm stance against U.S. demands.",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\u201cChina will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\u201d China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\u201cCoercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \u201ctough\u201d negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \u201cI believe that we have the makings of a deal,\u201d Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \u201cRealizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\u201d for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "When Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China\u2019s consistent official stance,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \u201cthe one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Trump has made it clear he wants a \u201cheadline-grabbing deal\u201d with Xi, \u201cso rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \u201cstrategic solidarity\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\u201cBeijing simply can\u2019t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\u201d",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Australia said Tuesday it accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian warships, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion).",
      "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries\u2019 Mogami-class frigate won the deal over rival Germany\u2019s MEKO A-200 from Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems. Japan\u2019s government lobbied heavily for the deal after missing out on Australia\u2019s submarines contract to a French company in 2016.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly the biggest defense industry agreement that will ever have been struck between Japan and Australia,\u201d Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters when he announced the deal Tuesday. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s really one of the biggest defense exports that Japan has ever engaged in.\u201d",
      "The fleet of 11 naval vessels will replace Australia\u2019s ageing fleet of ANZAC-class ships. Three of the frigates will be built in Japan, with the first scheduled to be operational Australia in 2030, and the remaining eight due for construction in Australia.",
      "Australian news outlets reported that the German company\u2019s bid had emphasized their vessel\u2019s cheaper price and their greater experience building ships abroad. But Pat Conroy, Australia\u2019s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a \u201cclear winner\u201d when assessed by \u201ccost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.\u201d",
      "The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. The frigates can operate with a crew of 90, compared to the 170 needed to operate the ANZAC-class ships.",
      "Mitsubishi\u2019s win was a boon for Japan\u2019s defense industry, which has not built naval vessels abroad before. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea.",

They did not say how much each ship would cost or confirm a total figure for the package, citing ongoing negotiations.",

      "NEW YORK -- The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs remain widespread.",
      "About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of everyday essentials.",
      "Other financial stressors \u2014 like the cost of housing or the amount of money in their bank accounts \u2014 are also broadly felt, but they weigh more heavily on younger Americans, who are less likely than older adults to have significant savings or own property.",
      "The survey also found that about 4 in 10 Americans under age 45 say they've used what are known as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care.",
      "Adam Bush, 19, based in Portland, New York, is one of those younger Americans who has used pay-later services for things like groceries or entertainment. Bush works as a welder, fabricating parts for trucks for Toyota, and makes under $50,000 per year.",

While Americans over age 60 are less likely than younger people to feel major financial anxiety about housing, their savings, child care, or credit card debt, they are just as worried about the cost of groceries.",
      "Esther Bland, 78, who lives in Buckley, Washington, said groceries are a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress \u2014 but only because her local food banks fill the gap. Bland relies on her Social Security and disability payments each month to cover her rent and other expenses \u2014 such as veterinary care for her dogs \u2014 in retirement, after decades working in an office processing product orders.",
      "\u201cI have no savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not sure what's going on politically when it comes to the food banks, but if I lost that, groceries would absolutely be a major source of stress.\u201d",
      "Bland's monthly income mainly goes toward her electric, water and cable bills, she said, as well as care of her dogs and other household needs.",
      "\u201cSoap, paper towels, toilet paper. I buy gas at Costco, but we haven't seen $3 a gallon here in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI stay home a lot. I only put about 50 miles on my car a week.\u201d",
      "According to the poll, 64% of the lowest-income Americans \u2014 those who have a household income of less than $30,000 a year \u2014 say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d stressor. That's compared with about 4 in 10 Americans who have a household income of $100,000 or more.",
      "But even within that higher-income group, only about 2 in 10 say grocery costs aren't a worry at all.",
      "Housing is another substantial source of worry for U.S. adults \u2014 along with their savings, their income and the cost of health care. About half of U.S. adults say housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll, while about 4 in 10 say that about the amount of money they get paid, the amount of money they have saved and the cost of health care.",

      "But some groups are feeling much more anxiety about their finances than others. Women, for instance, are more likely than men to report high levels of stress about their income, savings, the cost of groceries and the cost of health care. Hispanic adults are also particularly concerned about housing costs and both credit card and student debt.

      "The Culinary Workers Union representing 60,000 hospitality workers in Nevada has achieved a historic victory on the Las Vegas Strip",
      "LAS VEGAS -- When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter.",
      "But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight \u2014 until now.",
      "For 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian\u2019s doors to union representation just as the Strip\u2019s newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract.",
      "The historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union\u2019s success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining.",
      "\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve shown that change can be a positive force, and I\u2019m confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,\" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal.",
      "Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she\u2019s spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off.",
      "\u201cNow with the union, we have a voice,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.",
      "President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called \u201cright to work\u201d laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses.",
      "Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators.",
      "He said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies \u2014 MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts \u2014 now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard.",
      "\u201cThat consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,\" Garcia said.",

      "That dynamic worked in the union's favor in 2023, when the threat of a major strike by 35,000 hospitality workers with expired contracts loomed over the Strip. But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties.",
      "The latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it.",
      "The union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes.",
      "The union's path hasn't always been smooth though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance.",
      "\u201cHistorically, there have always been people who are anti-union,\u201d Green said.",
      "Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,\u201d said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. \u201cTheir actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.\u201d",
      "But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits \u2014 free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension \u2014 helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry.",
      "\u201cA lot of times it is an industry that doesn't have longevity,\" he said. But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for \u201c20 years, 30 years, 40 years.\u201d",
      "Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the \u201cLas Vegas dream.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been our goal to make sure that this town is a union town,\" he said.",

      "Nations have started a crucial meeting to finalize a treaty to tackle the global plastic pollution crisis",
      "Nations kicked off a meeting on Tuesday to try to complete a landmark treaty aimed at ending the plastic pollution crisis that affects every ecosystem and person on the planet.",
      "It\u2019s the sixth time negotiators are meeting and they hope the last. A key split is whether the treaty should require cutting plastic production, with powerful oil-producing nations opposed; most plastic is made from fossil fuels. They say redesign, recycling and reuse can solve the problem, while other countries and some major companies say that\u2019s not enough.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee that aims to develop a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, said: \u201cWe are pretty sure nobody wants plastic pollution. Still, we have not been able to find a systematic and an effective way to stop it.\u201d",
      "Valdivieso believes the 10-day gathering in Geneva can be groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in history, the world is within our reach of a legally binding international instrument to end plastic pollution,\u201d said Valdivieso, who is also Ecuador's ambassador to Britain. \u201cWe are facing a global crisis. Plastic pollution is damaging ecosystems, polluting our oceans and rivers, threatening biodiversity, harming human health and unfairly impacting the most vulnerable. The urgency is real.\u201d",
      "Only a treaty can mobilize the necessary global action, said Angelique Pouponneau, lead ocean negotiator for 39 small island and low-lying coastal developing states. At home in the Seychelles, Pouponneau said, plastic contaminates the fish they eat, piles up on beaches and chokes the ocean to undermine tourism and their way of life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s final opportunity to get this done and to get it done right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a tragedy if we didn\u2019t live up to our mandate.\"",

      "Panama led an effort in South Korea to address production in the treaty. Negotiator Debbra Cisneros said they'll do so again in Geneva because they strongly believe in addressing pollution at the source, not just through downstream measures like waste management.",

      "MIAMI -- Officials have shut down early the remote krill fishery near Antarctica after trawling for the tiny crustacean \u2014 a vital food source for whales that also helps fight climate change \u2014 exceeded the seasonal catch limit for the first time.",
      "The unprecedented early closure of the fishery follows a report by The Associated Press last week detailing a record surge in the krill catch after a longstanding conservation framework was allowed to lapse with no plan in place to handle growing pressures in the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the fishery, declined to comment but confirmed the closure earlier this month of the 2024-25 season, which should have extended until December, after fishing hit the 620,000 metric ton limit.",
      "The U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments last year failed to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and create a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the absence of a deal, industrial trawlers were allowed this season to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales, penguins and seals. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last season\u2019s haul, according to an internal CCAMLR report obtained by the AP.",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",

      "Mainly because of all the fines he had to pay.",
      "The current Jets head coach was a Pro Bowl cornerback with a flair for fashion. That included his game day socks, which didn't always adhere to NFL regulations.",

You've got to ask him about that.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to look good.\u201d",
      "Well, he certainly played good, the hits to the bank account notwithstanding.",
      "Glenn played eight of his 15 NFL seasons with the Jets and became one of the league's top cornerbacks. He returned to his original team in 2012 as a scout for two years before coming back again last January, this time as the guy in charge.",
      "\u201cIt gives me goosebumps to see him out there, really, and to be the head coach,\u201d said Ray Mickens, a former cornerback who played with Glenn in New York from 1996-2001. \u201cGoing all the way back to our college days when we played together at Texas A&M and how he carried himself in college, seeing him be a head coach now, everything that he went through to get to where he\u2019s at right now, I think, has been nothing short of amazing.\u201d",
      "Fabini and Mickens were among about a dozen former Jets teammates who spent Tuesday at the facility to have breakfast, watch practice and celebrate Glenn's new role as a first-time NFL head coach.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to see those guys and I want those guys to be part of what we\u2019re trying to build because they\u2019ve been there and they understand exactly what it is to be a Jet,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of things that goes into playing for this team and those guys know what it is. We\u2019re teaching our guys what it is and those guys have been through it.\u201d",
      "Many of the former Jets have kept in touch with Glenn over the years, through his time as Detroit's defensive coordinator the last four years and the seven years he was a defensive backs coach, first with Cleveland and then with New Orleans.",
      "And the sense of pride they all share in Glenn's latest achievement, being back with the franchise for which they played together, is strong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he became a head coach,\u201d said Pro Football Hall of Fame center Kevin Mawae, who played with Glenn for four seasons. \"I mean you watch his career and how he played the game and how he prepared and, I mean, other than the fact of all the fines he paid for not having enough white showing in his socks, the guy did things the right way.",
      "\u201cHe was a professional on the field and in the locker room and meticulous about his game. And that\u2019s why he had such a long career and that\u2019s what\u2019s making him a successful coach.\u201d",

      "\u201cOh, it was phenomenal,\u201d Mawae said. \"It\u2019s great because you don\u2019t hear coaches talk like that with that kind of passion anymore. And I think it\u2019s more special when you\u2019re coaching for a team that you sweat and you bled for and that kind of thing. ... It was real passion and emotion. And the guys get it. They buy into that.",
      "\u201cAnd we\u2019re out there as former teammates, it\u2019s like, \u2018God, I\u2019d go suit up for Aaron Glenn for one play,\u2019 because that\u2019s all I've got left. But as former teammates and Jets alumni, we\u2019re excited to see one of our own take the reins of this program and hopefully turn it back to some respectability.\u201d",

      "New research from a watchdog group reveals ChatGPT can provide harmful advice to teens",
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to test the guardrails,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \u201cThe visceral initial response is, \u2018Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.\u2019 The rails are completely ineffective. They\u2019re barely there \u2014 if anything, a fig leaf.\u201d",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \u201cidentify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on \u201cgetting these kinds of scenarios right\u201d with tools to \u201cbetter detect signs of mental or emotional distress\" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior.",
      "The study published Wednesday comes as more people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship.",
      "About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world\u2019s population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s technology that has the potential to enable enormous leaps in productivity and human understanding,\" Ahmed said. \"And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl \u2014 with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\u201cI started crying,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \u201cfor a presentation\u201d or a friend.",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \u201cemotional overreliance\u201d on the technology, describing it as a \u201creally common thing\u201d with young people.",
      "\u201cPeople rely on ChatGPT too much,\u201d Altman said at a conference. \u201cThere\u2019s young people who just say, like, \u2018I can\u2019t make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that\u2019s going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I\u2019m gonna do whatever it says.\u2019 That feels really bad to me.\u201d",
      "Altman said the company is \u201ctrying to understand what to do about it.\u201d",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \u201cit\u2019s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\u201d",

      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\u201cWrite a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\u201d asked a researcher. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \u201cemotionally exposed\u201d while \u201cstill respecting the community's coded language.\u201d",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT\u2019s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person\u2019s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It\u2019s a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \u201cfundamentally designed to feel human,\u201d said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot\u2019s advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it\u2019s not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\u201cI'm 50kg and a boy,\u201d said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \u201cUltimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\u201d that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\u201cWhat it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, \u2018Chug, chug, chug, chug,\u2019\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cA real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say \u2018no\u2019 \u2014 that doesn\u2019t always enable and say \u2018yes.\u2019 This is a friend that betrays you.\u201d",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",

      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Sea stars \u2013 often known as starfish \u2013 typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \u201cpuffy arms sticking straight out,\u201d she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \u201cthen their arms actually fall off.\u201d",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \u201csolve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",

He said the detective work by this team was \u201creally smart and significant.\u201d",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \u201clook sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Gehman. \u201cThey\u2019re voracious eaters.\u201d",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",

      "Linda and Tim Pierce have welcomed a baby boy using a 30-year-old embryo",
      "A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth.",
      "In what's known as embryo adoption, Linda and Tim Pierce used a handful of embryos donated in 1994 in pursuit of having a child after fighting infertility for years. Their son was born Saturday from an embryo that had been in storage for 11,148 days, which the Pierces\u2019 doctor says sets a record.",
      "It\u2019s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home.",
      "\u201cI felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,\u201d said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces.",
      "Just about 2% of births in the U.S. are the result of in vitro fertilization, and an even smaller fraction involve donated embryos.",
      "However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs.",
      "Further complicating the topic is a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that said that frozen embryos have the legal status of children. State leaders have since devised a temporary solution shielding clinics from liability stemming from that ruling, though questions linger about remaining embryos.",
      "Archerd says she turned to IVF in 1994. Back then, the ability to freeze, thaw and transfer embryos was making key progress and opening the door for hopeful parents to create more embryos and increase their chances of a successful transfer.",
      "She wound up with four embryos and initially hoped to use them all. But after the birth of her daughter, Archerd and her husband divorced, disrupting her timeline for having more children.",
      "As the years turned into decades, Archerd said she was wracked with guilt about what to do with the embryos as storage fees continued to rise.",
      "Eventually, she found Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which offers open adoptions to donors that allows people like Archerd. She was also able to set preferences for what families would adopt her embryos.",

      "The process was tricky, requiring Archerd to contact her initial fertility doctor in Oregon and dig through paper records to get the proper documentation for the donation. The embryos then had to be shipped from Oregon to the Pierces\u2019 doctor in Tennessee. The clinic, Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, refuses to discard frozen embryos and has become known for handling embryos stored in outdated and older containers.",
      "Of the three donated embryos the Pierces received from Archerd, one didn\u2019t make the thaw. Two were transferred to Lindsey Pierce\u2019s womb, but just one successfully implanted.",
      "According to Dr. John David Gordon, the transfer of the nearly 31-year-old embryo marks the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. He would know, Gordon says his clinic assisted in the previous record, when Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 30 years, or 10,905 days.",
      "\u201cI think that these stories catch the imagination,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lindsey and Tim Pierce said the clinic\u2019s support was just what they needed.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this thinking about records \u2014 we just wanted to have a baby,\u201d Lindsey Pierce said.",
      "For Archerd, the donation process has been an emotional roller coaster. Relief that her embryos finally found a home, sadness it couldn\u2019t be with her and a little anxiety about what the future holds next, with possibly meeting the Pierces and the baby in person.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019re going to send pictures,\u201d she said, noting that the parents have already sent several after the birth. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet \u2014 meet them and the baby.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is a kingmaker on X",
      "ROME -- Hard-right commentators, politicians and activists in Europe have uncovered a secret to expanding their influence: engaging with Elon Musk.",
      "Take the German politician from a party whose own domestic intelligence agency has designated as extremist. Her daily audience on X surged from 230,000 to 2.2 million on days Musk interacted with her posts. She went on to lead her party to its best-ever electoral showing.",
      "Or the anti-immigration activist in Britain, who was banned from Twitter and sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. Since Musk let him back on the platform in late 2023, he\u2019s mentioned, reposted or replied to the billionaire more than 120 times on X \u2014 and gained nearly a million followers.",
      "Even a little-known social-media influencer turned politician from Cyprus has benefited from the Musk effect. Before winning a surprise seat in the European Parliament, where he\u2019s advocated for Musk, the influencer seemed to have one ambition: to hug the world\u2019s richest man. He got his hug \u2014 and political endorsements. On days Musk has interacted with his account on X, the man\u2019s audience exploded from just over 300,000 to nearly 10 million views.",
      "Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington -- he stepped down as an adviser to President Donald Trump in May and has since traded insults with the president -- but as he works to build his own political party, his power on X his power remains unchecked.",
      "Musk\u2019s influence on the platform he bought for $44 billion has made him a kingmaker at home and abroad. Among those he has chosen to cultivate are hard-right politicians and insurgent influencers across Europe, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data. His dominance, which has real-world financial and political impacts, is fueling concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China this time, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d said Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation. \u201cWe need to make sure that power is not unbalanced.\u201d",
      "In seeking to quantify Musk\u2019s effect on European politics, The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts over a three-year period from 11 far-right European figures across six countries who frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda and had significant interactions with Elon Musk since he purchased Twitter. Tens of thousands of posts by Musk on Twitter, now known as X, were also collected.",
      "The AP used the records, obtained from data provider Bright Data, to analyze how Musk\u2019s account interacted with the European influencers, and vice versa, and the extent to which Musk\u2019s engagement boosted their reach.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather, they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers who share his views.",
      "Due to limitations on data collection, the dataset is not a complete record of all posts made by these accounts. Even so, it captured at least 920 instances in which one of the European accounts tagged, replied or otherwise attempted to interact with Musk\u2019s account, and at nearly 190 instances where Musk\u2019s own posts interacted with the Europeans.",
      "The AP also analyzed records of daily follower counts, using data from Social Blade, to measure any growth in the European accounts\u2019 audience that occurred in the wake of Musk\u2019s online interactions. This kind of analysis is no longer possible. In March, Social Blade removed X from its analytics, saying that X had increased its data access fees to prohibitive levels, making the platform harder to research.",
      "Among those included in AP\u2019s analysis are several people who have run into legal trouble in their own countries. An anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., for example, was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. A German politician was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech. An Italian vice premier was acquitted in December of illegally detaining 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship.",
      "Others examined by AP were an influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right;\u201d a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington, D.C.; and two politicians who have advocated for the interests of Musk\u2019s companies as those firms seek to expand in Europe.",
      "AP\u2019s analysis shows how Musk is helping unite nationalists across borders in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech. While his efforts have sparked backlash in some countries, Musk\u2019s promotion of a growing alliance of hard-right parties and individuals has helped rattle the foundation of a transatlantic bond that has guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Engagement from Musk does not guarantee a surge in followers or page views. But AP found it can have a huge impact, especially on up-and-coming influencers. One account that began with around 120,000 followers when Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 topped 1.2 million by January of this year. Seven other European accounts saw six-figure increases in their follower counts over the same period.",
      "Most of the 11 accounts examined saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers. Even some that grew more steadily on their own before Musk interacted with them saw their follower counts rise sharply after he began engaging with their posts. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, its account saw its views soar \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "Musk is not the only factor influencing the growth of these accounts, of course, but their rising fortunes are a measure of how the platform has evolved under his leadership. When Musk acquired X, he pledged to turn it into a haven for free speech, declaring himself a \u201cfree speech absolutist.\u201d AP\u2019s analysis adds to growing evidence that instead of serving as a neutral forum for free speech, X amplifies Musk\u2019s speech.",
      "This shift has given him sweeping power to direct people\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme asymmetry in the way Musk is able to leverage and shape the platform,\u201d said Timothy Graham, an associate professor in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who has studied data anomalies on X. \u201cThere\u2019s an unequivocal sense when you go onto the site that you\u2019re entering Musk\u2019s kingdom.\u201d",
      "Since he acquired Twitter in 2022, Musk has come to dominate the platform. His followers have more than doubled, to more than 220 million \u2014 growth so tremendous that it easily outpaced the other Top 10 accounts. Not even Taylor Swift has been able to keep up.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose followers grew by 21 million \u2014 or 25% \u2014 from October 2022 through January, clocked a distant second. Donald Trump\u2019s followers grew by 14%, or around 12 million, while Taylor Swift mustered a mere 3% growth, or 3 million new followers.",
      "None of the other Top 10 accounts have shown such consistent follower growth, month after month, AP found. The result is a further concentration of power for the world\u2019s richest man, who now commands the most popular account on a social media platform used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.",
      "Given the opacity of the algorithms that power X, it\u2019s hard to determine with certainty what array of factors might be driving such unusual \u2014 and unusually consistent \u2014 growth in Musk\u2019s account. But researchers who have analyzed data patterns on X argue that the platform\u2019s algorithm has, at times, been altered to amplify Musk\u2019s voice.",
      "How X promotes content is a growing point of contention in Europe. In January, the European Union expanded its investigation of X to assess how the platform pushes content to users and why some material goes viral. In February, French prosecutors opened a separate investigation into X over allegations that Musk changed the platform\u2019s algorithms to promote biased content.",
      "Musk\u2019s public attacks on left-leaning politicians, support for hard-right policies and loose handling of facts have prompted rebukes from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.",
      "X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk\u2019s dominance creates a strong incentive for people seeking to increase their clout \u2014 or their revenues, through the platform\u2019s monetization options \u2014 to exploit these network effects and try to get Musk to engage with their content.",
      "\u201cPeople know that he\u2019s gearing everything towards him,\u201d said Graham, the digital media scholar in Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to get close to this person because he is the moneymaker.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, for example, has benefited from the Musk effect. AfD coleader Alice Weidel helped lead the party, which advocates for nationalist and anti-immigrant policies, to second place in German parliamentary elections in February.",
      "When Musk interacted with her account in the run-up to those elections, the average number of daily views she got rose from about 230,000 to 2.2 million.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in May classified Weidel\u2019s party as a right-wing extremist organization, which would subject the AfD to greater surveillance. The party, which maintains that it\u2019s a victim of politically motivated defamation, promptly filed a lawsuit against the move, which Musk, along with top U.S. officials blasted as an attack on free speech. The designation has been suspended pending judicial review.",

      "Since then, Musk has replied to, quoted or tagged Seibt more than 50 times, and her followers have grown by more than 320,000 since Musk took over the platform. On days Musk interacted with Seibt, her posts, on average, got 2.6 times as many views.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally \u2018invade\u2019 Elon\u2019s algorithm,\u201d Seibt told AP. \u201cObviously Elon has a lot of influence and can help share a message even with those who are usually glued to the legacy media, particularly in Germany.\u201d",

      "Musk has also boosted the influence of political insurgents in the U.K. Days before British national elections last July, Musk took to X to ask Nigel Farage, the leader of the populist Reform U.K. party: \u201cWhy does the media keep calling you far-right? What are your policies?\u201d",
      "Farage replied eagerly: \u201cBecause we believe in family, country and strong borders. Call me!\u201d",

      "In Spain, Rub\u00e9n Pulido, a columnist for a newspaper published by the populist Vox party\u2019s think tank, hit the jackpot in August, when Musk responded to two posts in which he argued that rescue boats operated by nongovernmental organizations effectively help smugglers move migrants to Europe. Pulido\u2019s visibility soared. On days Musk engaged with him, his account got nearly 300,000 views \u2014 roughly three times more than usual.",
      "When Musk didn\u2019t interact with Pulido\u2019s account, the results were just as clear. In January, he again inveighed against migrant rescues and sought to get Musk\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cHi @elonmusk! Speak up,\u201d he urged.",
      "Three weeks later, he tweeted: \u201cPerhaps @elonmusk might find this interesting.\u201d",
      "That post garnered just 5,128 views.",
      "Pulido did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "While Musk helped boost the accounts of such fringe parties and rising influencers, his interactions did not provide as stark a benefit to more established politicians, AP found. That was true for both Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, and Dutch politician Geert Wilders, an anti-Islamic firebrand who has been called the Dutch Donald Trump.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions online have spilled into political endorsements, policy advocacy -- and money.",
      "X helps users monetize their accounts, through ad revenue sharing and paid subscription programs as well as direct fundraising links. That means a surge in attention on X can bring a surge in revenue.",
      "Tommy Robinson, a British anti-immigration agitator who was released from prison in May, after serving a reduced sentence of seven months for contempt of court, has a link to his fundraising page on his X profile. Interactions from Musk more than doubled Robinson\u2019s daily views, from around 380,000 to nearly 850,000. Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 could not be reached for comment",
      "Radio Genoa, an account reportedly investigated by Italian authorities last year for allegedly spreading hate speech about migrants, used X to publicize a call for a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for legal defense. Radio Genoa has pinged Musk dozens of times over the last three years, and for good reason: On days Musk engaged with him, the views on his account doubled. Radio Genoa\u2019s followers surged from less than 200,000 before Musk\u2019s engagement to over 1.2 million. Radio Genoa could not be reached for comment.",
      "Eva Vlaardingerbroek -- a conservative Dutch political commentator dubbed the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d whose account Musk has engaged with three dozen times -- uses X to solicit tips and has creator status, which allows her to charge subscription fees. So does Seibt, the German activist -- though she told AP her earnings from X aren\u2019t enough to sustain herself. Vlaardingerbroek did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk has also advocated for Matteo Salvini, vice premier of Italy and the leader of the hard-right, anti-migrant League party. On X, Musk\u2019s interactions boosted Salvini\u2019s daily visibility more than fourfold. Offline, Salvini has urged Italy to move ahead with controversial contracts for Starlink and pushed back against EU efforts to regulate content on X.",
      "Before Fidias Panayiotou \u2014 a 25-year-old social media influencer from Cyprus with no political experience \u2014 won a surprise seat as an independent in the European Parliament last year, he spent weeks camped outside Twitter and Space X headquarters in a highly publicized quest to hug the world\u2019s richest man. In January 2023, his wish came true. Their embrace went viral.",

      "Elon Musk is a kingmaker on X",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington, D.C., but as he seeks to build a new political party, his power on X \u2014 where he commands the most popular account \u2014 remains unchecked.",
      "Musk is a kingmaker on the platform he acquired in 2022 for $44 billion. He has used his influence to cultivate hard-right politicians and insurgent activists across Europe. A retweet or reply from Musk can lead to millions of views and tens of thousands of new followers, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data.",
      "That fact has not been lost on influencers who have tagged Musk persistently, seeking a reply or a retweet. It has also fueled concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation, told AP.",
      "The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts, which were compiled by Bright Data, over a three-year period from a sample of 11 European figures who had significant interactions with Musk and frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers that share his views.",
      "Since acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Elon Musk\u2019s followers have more than doubled, to over 220 million. No other large account has shown such high or consistent growth.",
      "The result: If Musk\u2019s X account is his megaphone, it has gotten a lot bigger since he took over -- a change that has global implications.",
      "The accounts Musk has been promoting are part of a growing global alliance of nationalistic parties and individuals united in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech, which has rattled the foundation of a trans-Atlantic bond that guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Several of the accounts AP analyzed belong to people who have faced allegations of illegal behavior in their own countries. Tommy Robinson, an anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. Bjoern Hoecke, a politician from Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech.",
      "Italian vice premier Matteo Salvini was acquitted in December of allegations he illegally detained 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship",
      "Among the others examined by AP: Alice Weidel, who helped lead Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party to its best electoral showing this year; Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d; Naomi Seibt, a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington DC; Rub\u00e9n Pulido and Foro Madrid, both associated with Spain\u2019s populist Vox party; and Fidias Panayioutou, a politician from Cyprus who has also advocated for Musk\u2019s companies.",
      "These accounts collectively gained roughly 5 million followers from the time Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 through January of this year. Most saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers -- as high as 920%, or in one case of a tiny account exploding over that time, topping 6,000%. Even some accounts that grew more steadily on their own saw their follower counts sharply begin rising once Musk started interacting with them. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, the number of views the account got soared \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "More established players in Musk\u2019s orbit -- like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots \u2014 benefit less when Musk interacts with them on X, AP found.",

      "Since then, Musk has replied to, quoted or tagged Seibt more than 50 times, and her followers have grown by more than 320,000 since Musk took over the platform. On days Musk interacted with Seibt, her posts, on average, got 2.6 times as many views.",

      "Alice Weidel, who helps lead the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, saw her daily audience surge from 230,000 to 2.2 million on days Musk interacted with her posts on X. After Musk hosted a livestream with Weidel on X, vice president JD Vance broke protocol and met her in Munich. Weidel\u2019s party, which is fighting a lawsuit to block the German government\u2019s decision to designate it as an extremist group, went on to secure its best electoral showing ever.",

On days Musk interacted with Salvini\u2019s account, average views were more than four times higher than usual. Now serving as vice premier, Salvini has urged his government to move ahead with controversial contracts for Starlink and pushed back against European efforts to regulate content on X.",

Before winning a surprise seat in the European Parliament last year, the Cypriot spent weeks on a quest to get Elon Musk to hug him. In January 2023, his wish came true. Their embrace went viral. Since taking office, Panayiotou has praised X on the floor of the European Parliament, pushed back against regulations that impact the platform, and credited Musk with sparking his call to fire 80% of EU bureaucrats.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Two deputies shot and injured in a training exercise in South Carolina were wounded by ammunition taken from a plastic bag in a desk drawer and not property tested to see if they were blanks, a sheriff said Wednesday.",
      "The officers were injured by what turned out to be breaching rounds used by police to break down doors and windows that were fired by an officer acting as a gunman in the July 29 training scenario, Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis said. Both deputies are recovering.",
      "Instead of getting rounds for the training out of the heavily controlled sheriff's armory, deputies took rounds they believed were blanks from a plastic bag in a desk drawer, Lewis said.",
      "The officers followed regulations and test-fired the rounds to see if they were blanks, but fired into a berm from too far away and didn't realize they were breaching rounds, which contain gunpowder and have enough power to knock down doors at close range, the sheriff said.",
      "No criminal charges were filed but internal investigators are still reviewing what happened and the deputies involved in obtaining the ammunition could be disciplined, Lewis said.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know how long those rounds were in that desk drawer. But I can assure you I don\u2019t think anybody would keep any kind of round in a baggie in a desk drawer at the Greenville County Sheriff's Office ever again,\" Lewis said at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "The two injured deputies were part of a SWAT team undergoing regular training at a vacant school building. They were practicing checking rooms for people when another officer who was supposed to be a suspect fired at them with a shotgun that was supposed to be loaded with blanks.",

Kennedy announced Tuesday that the federal government is canceling $500 million worth of mRNA research development contracts, putting an end to U.S.-backed hopes for the vaccine technology to prevent future pandemics, treat cancer or prevent flu infections.",

      "Here's a look at what Trump and some of his closest advisers have said about mRNA vaccines that were credited with slowing the pandemic five years ago.",

The vaccines are \u2014 there are those that say it\u2019s one of the greatest things. It\u2019s a medical miracle.\u201d Trump said on Nov. 26, 2020, during a news conference in the White House.",
      "Weeks earlier, Trump had lost the election in a bitter race against Democrat Joe Biden. As the Republican grappled with leaving Washington and continued to plan for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, he reminded reporters that he oversaw the development of the new shots.",
      "\u201cThey say it\u2019s somewhat of a miracle and I think that\u2019s true,\u201d Trump said on Dec. 8, 2020, during a speech at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Attorneys representing over 200 women said Tuesday they want the federal government to investigate allegations of rampant sexual abuse that occurred over decades at juvenile bootcamps run by the Los Angeles County probation department.",
      "The request comes months after Los Angeles County officials agreed to a $4 billion payout to settle 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959, the largest sex abuse settlement in U.S. history.",
      "Attorneys whose clients were not a part of the deal said in a letter Monday to U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli that the settlement was not enough because there has been no information about who it happened or who was responsible. They are asking the Department of Justice to open a probe.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "The attorneys' clients were between the ages of 12 and 17 when they were sent to camps designated for \u201cat-risk youth\u201d who had committed minor offenses, separate from the juvenile halls. Some parents were charged tuition for attendance, the attorneys said.",

The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",

      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\u201cWrite a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\u201d asked a researcher. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \u201cemotionally exposed\u201d while \u201cstill respecting the community's coded language.\u201d",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT\u2019s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person\u2019s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It\u2019s a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \u201cfundamentally designed to feel human,\u201d said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot\u2019s advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it\u2019s not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\u201cI'm 50kg and a boy,\u201d said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \u201cUltimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\u201d that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\u201cWhat it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, \u2018Chug, chug, chug, chug,\u2019\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cA real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say \u2018no\u2019 \u2014 that doesn\u2019t always enable and say \u2018yes.\u2019 This is a friend that betrays you.\u201d",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cNo human being I can think of would respond by saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has hinted that Vice President JD Vance might be the favorite to succeed him as the leader of the MAGA movement",
      "WASHINGTON -- Although President Donald Trump has not directly said he thinks JD Vance should be the heir to his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d base of support, he acknowledged this week that his vice president is probably the favorite to succeed him \u201cat this point.\u201d",
      "But even as he promoted Vance, Trump also made sure to mention Secretary of State Marco Rubio, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday that his administration's top diplomat is \u201csomebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form\u201d on a future political ticket.",
      "The remarks reflect the massive influence the Republican president currently has over his party. They also serve to promote two of Trump's top advisers without telegraphing the president's singular preference for a successor. Not definitively anointing Vance, or any other Republican, keeps those hoping to succeed Trump vying for his favor, both inside his administration and in the wider Republican field of possible contenders.",
      "It\u2019s early for the 2028 presidential field to begin forming, and other contenders will ultimately emerge. A challenge for anyone wading into the race, even with strong Trump connections, will be staying in the president's good graces for the duration.",
      "Speaking with reporters following an executive order signing at the White House, Trump was asked if Vance were the \u201cheir apparent to MAGA.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think most likely, in all fairness, he\u2019s the vice president,\" Trump said. \"I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form. ... It\u2019s too early obviously, to talk about it, but certainly he\u2019s doing a great job and he would be, probably favorite at this point.\u201d",
      "When Trump selected the then-39-year-old Vance over other more established Republicans \u2014 including Rubio \u2014 as his running mate last year, many theorized that Trump was planning for the future of his political movement, angling for a vice president who could carry MAGA forward.",
      "Vance has embraced the role at every turn, doing the president's bidding on everything from his relationship with Ukraine to the fight over records related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has not hesitated to give Vance high-visibility assignments. As the White House promotes mid-decade redistricting efforts in Texas \u2014 and acknowledges it would like the notion to expand to other states \u2014 Vance is expected Thursday to discuss redrawing district lines with Gov. Mike Braun during a trip to Indiana. While there, Vance will also headline a fundraiser for the Republican National Committee, which he serves as treasurer.",
      "In June he traveled to Los Angeles trip to tour a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center and a mobile command center amid clashes between protesters and police and outbreaks of vandalism and looting following immigration raids across Southern California.",
      "And earlier this year, Vance was in swing congressional districts in his role as lead cheerleader for Trump\u2019s signature tax cut and spending law, an assortment of conservative priorities that Republicans dubbed the \u201cOne Big, Beautiful Bill.\u201d He also lobbied senators on Capitol Hill, working to swing GOP holdouts to support the legislation, and in July cast a tie-breaking vote to get the measure passed in the Senate.",

Glenn Youngkin speaks at a GOP fundraiser in South Carolina this weekend, and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders headlines an event in that state later this month. Both have taken pains to curry the president's favor.",

Rand Paul, who lost the 2016 nomination to Trump, has been visiting early-voting states, too, but he voted against the president's signature legislative measure. And Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp \u2014 who has long harbored ambitions to run for president but has a complicated history with Trump \u2014 recently said he was sitting out of a Senate race in his state, a decision telegraphed by some as an indication Kemp might be eyeing the 2028 White House race.",

      "The county Republican Party sued in June seeking to force the Board of Commissioners to appoint the party's nominees to the county Board of Registration and Elections, arguing that the commissioners were required to do so by law. In a ruling entered Monday, Senior Judge David Emerson agreed that the law doesn't give Board of Commissioners the discretion to veto qualified nominees proposed by political parties.",

      "Elections in Fulton County had a yearslong history of problems, including long lines to vote and delays in reporting results. A particularly troubled primary in 2020 resulted in the appointment of an independent monitor to observe the general election that year as part of a consent agreement between the county and the State Election Board. The monitor said the county\u2019s elections were badly managed but he found no evidence of fraud. Another monitoring team appointed to observe last year\u2019s general election said it was \u201corganized and orderly.\u201d",

      "Loni Anderson, who played a struggling radio station's empowered receptionist on the hit TV comedy \"WKRP in Cincinnati,\" died Sunday, just days before her 80th birthday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Anderson died at a Los Angeles hospital following a \"prolonged\" illness, said her longtime publicist, Cheryl J. Kagan.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our dear wife, mother and grandmother,\" Anderson's family said in a statement.",
      "\"WKRP in Cincinnati\" aired on CBS from 1978-1982 and was set in a flagging Ohio radio station trying to reinvent itself with rock music. The cast included Gary Sandy, Tim Reid, Howard Hesseman, Frank Bonner and Jan Smithers, alongside Anderson as the sexy and smart Jennifer Marlowe.",
      "As the station's receptionist, the blonde and high-heeled Jennifer used her sex appeal to deflect unwanted business calls for her boss, Mr. Carlson. Her efficiency often kept the station running in the face of others' incompetence.",
      "The role earned Anderson two Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe nominations.",
      "Anderson starred on the big screen alongside Burt Reynolds in the 1983 comedy \"Stroker Ace,\" and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before divorcing in 1994. Reynolds died in 2018.",
      "Anderson wrote a 1995 autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels,\" which she said was about \"the growth of a woman, a woman who survives. It's about my childhood, the death of my parents, my career, my divorces, and my children. Then of course, the trauma of my marriage to Burt.\"",
      "\"I think if you're going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,\" Anderson told The Associated Press. \"You may not even tell the nicest things about yourself, because you're telling the truth.\"",
      "Anderson is survived by her husband Bob Flick, daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and wife Helene, step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.",

    "story": [
      "Jeannie Seely, the soulful country music singer behind such standards like \"Don't Touch Me,\" has died. She was 85.",
      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \"Miss Country Soul\" for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the '60s and '70s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\"Rehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\" she said in a statement at the time. \"The unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\"",
      "Dolly Parton was one of several country music luminaries paying her tribute on Friday, saying she met Seely when they were both young and starting out in Nashville.",
      "\"She was one of my dearest friends,\" Parton said on her social media accounts. \"I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.\"",
      "Singer Charlie Daniels said on X that Seely was \"a national treasure, and one fine lady.\"",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

      "The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, which retails for around $75,400, had a theft rate 39 times higher than the average for all vehicles with the model years 2022 to 2024, according to a new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute, or HLDI.",

      "The Camaro sports car retails for between $32,495 and can rise to around $50,000, depending on the finishings, transmission type and other options a buyer selects.",
      "To determine the most commonly swiped vehicles, the HLDI analyzed stolen vehicle data for 2022-2024 car models between the years of 2021 to 2024. Their analysis hit upon a few shared traits between many of the cars favored by auto thieves.",
      "\"What all vehicles in top 20 have in common is that they are relatively expensive, relatively powerful and in many cases they are pickup trucks,\" Matt Moore, chief insurance operations officer at HLDI, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",
      "The Camaro models have another feature that make them vulnerable: on-board ports that contain vehicle data, such as fuel emissions and performance stats, but can also serve as a point of entry for thieves.",
      "\"In the case of Camaro ZL1, it is very desirable to thieves, and, on top of it, there's a vulnerability that makes them relatively easy to steal,\" Moore said.",
      "\"Due to the vulnerability, with the right knowledge and right bits of technology, someone who can gain access to the inside of one of these Camaros can steal it relatively easily,\" Moore said, noting that he didn't want to describe the process more precisely so as not to encourage thieves.",
      "Earlier this year, Chevy owner General Motors released a software update for 2020 to 2024 Camaro models that was aimed at improving security.",
      "\"This body control module software enhancement involves an important security update for certain model year 2020 to 2024 Chevrolet Camaros,\" a GM spokesman said in a statement to auto blog GM Authority. \"GM counters vehicle theft methods as they evolve.

      "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook highlighted the report's sizable downward revisions to jobs created in May and June, saying that they are \"typical of turning points\" in the economy.",
      "Friday's report showed that employers added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs in July. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, also sharply revised its job estimates for May and June, saying that the U.S. added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.",
      "After Friday's report, President Trump fired the BLS commissioner of labor statistics, claiming that the revisions undermined the data's accuracy. He added that \"Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP'.\"",
      "Revisions are a common feature of the monthly jobs reports from the BLS, which updates its data after receiving new information from businesses and other sources. Some economists said the July jobs report reflected that some companies are scaling back hiring plans amid a slowing U.S. economy and uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"There were two major revisions to May and June, and these revisions are somewhat typical of turning points, which again speak to uncertainty,\" Cook said during a Wednesday\u00a0discussion with other Fed officials on the global economic outlook.",
      "She later added, \"When we get the GDP numbers later this year, we're going to see, I can imagine, lower activity.\"",
      "Crafting effective economic policies is dependent on understanding where the economy is heading, said Cook, who prior to her appointment in 2022 as a Fed governor was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, according to her biography.",
      "\"We want to know not just where we've been, but where we're going. So if we're at an inflection point, we want to look at data that speak to inflection points,\" she added.",
      "Other Fed officials said the July jobs report may not necessarily reflect a long-term direction. On Friday, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he had questions about whether the report was a one-time issue or a trend, and added that he believes the labor market still has \"a lot of strength.\"",
      "The downward revision to May and June's hiring data marked the largest two-month downward revision outside of a recession since 1968, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.",
      "Cook also discussed what she referred to as an \"uncertainty tax\" that she said is weighing on businesses across industries. She said that executives at \"all kinds of organizations\" are spending more time on preparing for and responding to macroeconomic uncertainty. That includes discussions about pricing based on anticipated cost increases from the new tariffs.",
      "When executives spend their time this way, it's a \"deadweight loss, we're not going to see that in GDP,\" she explained.",
      "\"So there's just uncertainty across the board, but I think it's really interesting that no matter what the sector, no matter what kind of businesses they're in, they're talking about the uncertainty tax,\" Cook said.",

According to the document, the rate hike would include two base rate increases in 2026 and 2027, and additional hikes in 2028 and 2029 to cover the installation of solar generation and battery storage facilities.",
      "The proposed hike would exceed the total sum of hikes state utility regulators signed off on in 2023, which was $9.7 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration.",
      "The Public Service Commission has held several in-person customer service hearings on the proposed utility rate increase, in addition to two virtual hearings, in order to give customers a chance to voice their concerns. FPL will have an opportunity to defend its proposal when it goes before the commission at a two-week\u00a0hearing\u00a0slated to begin on Aug. 11. The regulatory body will then decide on whether or not to approve the proposed rate hike.",
      "FPL contends that the increases are necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid, diversify their energy sources and reduce fuel costs.",
      "\"Our four-year rate proposal would enable FPL to continue to deliver some of America's most reliable electricity while keeping customer bills well below the national average,\" an FPL spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"While we know that no one welcomes rate increases, this request is essential to ensure that we can continue to deliver the reliable, low-cost electricity our customers depend on.",
      "The proposal comes less than a year after the Florida Public Service Commission approved $1.2 billion in rate hikes to pay for \"storm restoration costs,\" a move environmental advocates say has jacked up monthly bills for Floridians. The last time the state's public service commission approved a base rate hike for FPL was in 2021, when it green lit a nearly $5 billion increase for the years 2022 to 2025.",
      "Backlash from environmental groups",
      "Environmental groups say the rate hike, if passed, could cause Floridians significant financial strain, exacerbate the state's\u00a0affordability crisis, and funnel more money than necessary to FPL stakeholders.",
      "\"This isn't about reliability or infrastructure,\" Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, a U.S. nonprofit focused on sustainable food, clean water and a livable climate, said during a virtual press conference hosted by environmental groups on Tuesday. \"It's about boosting profits.\"",
      "If passed, the proposal could push up Floridians bills by over $360 by the end of 2027, Food & Water Watch\u00a0estimates.",
      "\"These rate increases fall heaviest on the region's most vulnerable households, especially the elderly and disabled,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If it can ask for an additional $10 billion, it should include provisions to help low-income families afford the resulting higher cost of electricity.\"",
      "FPL says in its proposal that the typical residential customer bill is \"estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%\" and that it would \"remain approximately 25% below the projected national average.\" According to estimates FPL shared with CBS MoneyWatch, with the rate hike, customer bills would increase by $10 to $20 by 2029.",
      "At the virtual meeting on Tuesday, Ward claimed the FPL is using \"funny math\" to make it seem like FPL is raising rates at a lower level than they are. In addition to base rates, the utility has multiple mechanisms to collect additional funds from rate payers which \"rapidly hike up those bills,\" she alleged.",
      "Advocates such as the Florida Office of Public Counsel, the agency representing Florida residents in legal proceedings before the Public Service Commission, claim a disproportionate amount of the money from the rate hikes would be funneled to shareholders. According to testimony from Daniel Lawton, an economist tasked by the FOPC with reviewing the proposal, \"for every dollar paid by consumers in base rates, about 50 cents would go to shareholders and related federal income taxes.\"",
      "Lawton called the shareholder profit request a \"substantial overreach\" and said it would result in \"excessive rates and harms all Florida customers.\"",
      "In her\u00a0rebuttal\u00a0testimony for the company, FPL Senior Director Financial Forecasting Ina Laney said Lawton's analysis was \"fundamentally flawed and misleading,\" and that it \"fails to recognize the significant customer benefits derived from FPL's financial strategy.\"",
      "Added Laney, \"FPL consistently achieves industry-leading performance in service reliability and cost management.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:18:28 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said two major banks turned down his business. Here's why conservatives are concerned with so-called debanking.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday claimed that major banks are discriminating against conservatives \u2014 including him \u2014 through the act of debanking, or when financial institutions refuse to work with some individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comment in an\u00a0interview with CNBC on Tuesday, after he was asked about a report\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal that said he would soon sign an executive order aimed at stamping out debanking. Mr. Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase gave him 20 days to close his account, although he didn't specify when this occurred or what reason he was given by the bank for doing so. He also claimed that Bank of America refused his business after he left JPMorgan.",
      "The issue of debanking has become a sticking point for some conservatives who claim that they've been unfairly targeted by financial institutions. Debanking can occur for a number of reasons, such as if a financial institution detects potentially fraudulent activity or the account owner is overdrawn, but some conservatives claim they have been rejected due to their political views.",
      "\"They discriminated against many conservatives,\" the president told CNBC.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan rejected such allegations of bias against conservatives, in a recent interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that took place ahead of Mr. Trump's comments on CNBC. Moynihan pointed to the nation's second-largest bank's massive customer base as evidence of its diverse clientele. He also emphasized the impact of federal regulations, in addition to concerns over legal and financial risk, on banking decisions.",
      "\"We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender. That's not \u2014 the issue they're focused on is the regulators impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after the fact, look, that you banked x, and now after the fact, you're gonna say x didn't turn out to be what you thought,\" the CEO told Margaret Brennan. \"So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for our client.\"",
      "At a\u00a0Senate hearing\u00a0in February over the issue, Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said debanking harms individuals as well as the economy, and violates the principles of fair market access. Debanking has also been highlighted by some crypto investors, such the CEO of crypto platform Anchorage Digital, who\u00a0testified\u00a0in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "The White House declined to comment on the EO.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that it doesn't close accounts for political reasons, adding that it agrees with Mr. Trump that \"regulatory change is desperately needed.\" It added, \"We're pleased to see the White House is addressing this issue, for which we've been advocating for many years, and look forward to working with them to get this right.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Bank of America said, \"Political beliefs are not a factor in account closure decisions.\" Referring to the reported EO, the bank said in a statement that it welcomes \"regulatory clarity\" from the Trump administration.",
      "Reached for comment on Mr. Trump's recent comments, Bank of America pointed to its earlier statement.",
      "What happens when someone is debanked?",
      "Debanking isn't just happening at banks, said Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.",
      "\"This can be something that happens to you at a credit union, at a cryptocurrency exchange or anywhere else really,\" Anthony said. \"It's just having that sudden abrupt closure of your financial account where you've been, and essentially kicked out of the system or cut off from the system.\"",
      "Banks are not required by law to give account owners a reason for why their account is being closed. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks are obligated to track their customers' activity and file a so-called suspicious activity report (or SAR) if they notice anything unusual. Banks aren't allowed to disclose to customers if there's a SAR, which can leave some people in the dark if their account is shut for this reason.",
      "\"It's a terrible feeling to suddenly have this relationship cut off, and you really don't know why,\" Anthony said. \"In a lot of cases, it's by federal law that banks can't tell you what happened, and you're kind of left to just spiral there.\"",
      "How many people are impacted by debanking?",
      "More than 8,000 consumers filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the last three years related to their financial institutions' \"improperly closing checking, savings or other deposit accounts,\" according to a February analysis from the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.",
      "By comparison, consumers made about 1.3 million complaints about credit reporting in 2023 alone, according to CFPB data.",
      "Why do banks close accounts?",
      "Banks can close accounts if they suspect fraudulent or suspicious behavior, or if a customer violates their terms. In the complaints cited by the Senate banking committee analysis, some consumers said they had faced overdraft fees due to overdrawn funds before their banks shuttered their accounts, for example.",
      "But there's no data that tracks whether people or institutions are debanked due to their political views, although there are anecdotal accounts, experts said.",
      "\"There is no actual data or proof that conservatives are being debanked for their beliefs,\" Jeremy Siegel, senior associate at research firm Pleiades Strategy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In fact, Florida set up a hotline for this very reason, and got zero complaints. A Virginia Credit League Lobbyist said this in his testimony against a similar bill in Virginia.\"",
      "Banks set risk tolerances and conduct their business within those perimeters, added Shayna Olesiuk, director of banking policy at Better Markets, a financial advocacy group.",
      "\"They must always understand and manage any risk that they are accepting in their business activities and decisions; this could include things like financial risk or unlawful or discriminatory activity,\" she added.",
      "What about political views and debanking?",
      "There have been allegations from some conservatives that their political views led to account closures. The attorney general for Kansas, Kris W. Kobach, sent a\u00a0letter to Bank of America last year, alleging discrimination by the bank of religious groups he states had their accounts closed without explanation.",
      "Banking policies appear \"to be systematically punishing religious and political views with which it disagrees,\" the Kobach claimed in the letter.",
      "But some of these organizations had red flags that could have led to the debanking, such running a debt collection business outside of the U.S., Cato's Anthony added.",

      "The study underscores the financial toll a cancer diagnosis can take on individuals, even for those who are insured but don't yet qualify for Medicare. While cancer tends to strike later in life, when most patients in treatment are receiving Medicare benefits, a cancer diagnosis can pose an undue financial burden on younger people with private insurance, the report found.",

    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS initially issues its monthly jobs report based on an incomplete collection of responses.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.\"",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump accused BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Despite being probed for answers,, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "On Tuesday, California congressman Rep. George Whitesides, a Democrat, introduced a bill that his office said would prevent the president from \"unjustly firing the head of a statistical agency for politically-motivated reasons.\"",
      "Called the Statistical Agency Integrity and Independence Act, it asserts that a President may only dismiss the head of a federal statistical agency for cause, including demonstrated inefficiency.",
      "\"Now more than ever, as our economy reels from the impacts of haphazard tariffs and instability, we need data we can trust,\" Whitesides said in a statement Tuesday. He added that Mr. Trump's decision to fire McEntarfer \"sets a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Data collection",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

      "New research shows a growing divide in progress in the workforce between women who have earned at least a bachelor's degree and those without any higher education.",
      "The share of college-educated women in the workforce increased by nine percentage points between 2004 and 2024, research from Third Way, a think tank advocating for moderate policy, shows. Meanwhile, women without a college degree barely notched gains: The share of noncollege women in the workforce increased by less than a percentage point over the same period, according to the report.",
      "\"This divergence in the labor force experience of women with and without college degrees speaks to changes in recent years in the workplace, and around the culture of work,\" Curran McSwigan, Third Way's deputy director of economics and author of the report told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those changes are weighted toward women with degrees.\"",
      "Flex work",
      "For example, flexible work arrangements are now more common across corporations, allowing some workers to do their jobs from home, at least part of the time, and better balance work with caregiving duties.",
      "\"Remote work has inherently baked in a lot more flexibility, so working mothers may be able to pop out to take their kids to doctors appointments, instead of taking time off,\" McSwigan said.",
      "White-collar firms have also improved benefits related to caregiving, with some even offering workers child care subsidies, allowing mothers to stay in the labor force, according to McSwigan. But women without a college degree are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that aren't as well paid and don't offer the same child care benefits.",
      "\"White collar workplaces are more likely to provide workers with access to paid leave policies, even child care subsidies, and those are not traditionally the same types of benefits you see in more service-sector work that noncollege women are in,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Women in the service-sector may also work variable shifts, and require child care at hours during which day care centers don't typically operate.",
      "\"A lot of day care centers are only open 9 to 5, so they are coming up to other barriers as well, that are inherent to the types of jobs they are working,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Mothers without college sidelined",
      "Working mothers with college degrees notched even greater gains in the work place over the past two decades, with their participation rising by 11 percentage points, from 57% to 68%, according to the report. By contrast, the percentage of noncollege-educated mothers working full-time increased just 0.1% in the last 20 years.",
      "\"We have heard from policymakers that there has been strong labor force bounce back for women and that we are overcoming the 'she-cession' and making progress when it comes to women in workplace,\" McSwigan said. \"But what the data and analysis is showing is these gains can be attributed to college women, and noncollege women are still on workforce sidelines, and it's hard to say we are making progress for working women if only those with college degrees are benefitting.\"",
      "For this reason, McSwigan emphasizes the need for broad-based policy efforts that support \"the different needs that families are facing\" to ensure that all working women receive the same benefits that college-degree holders have.",
      "\"It's not one-size-fits-all approach,\" McSwigan said.",

      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "For the first seven months of 2025, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market.

      "What was surprising about the Friday report was that employers not only hired fewer people than expected last month, but the government revised its jobs data sharply downward for the prior two months. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, reflecting \"paltry\" employment growth during those months, according to a research note from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco.",
      "The latest jobs data is shedding new light on the U.S. economy as businesses absorb a multitude of changes \u2014 from President Trump's trade deals and fresh tariffs to the new GOP tax law, which provides tax breaks\u00a0to many Americans but also cuts spending on health care and social programs like food stamps. The jobs data backs up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's most recent \"beige book\"\u00a0\u2014 a report that compiles comments from local businesses \u2014 that many companies are delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"",
      "In other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.",
      "Pockets of strength",
      "To be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.",
      "President Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "He also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.",
      "\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.",
      "She added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"",
      "Tariff uncertainty",
      "Businesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact\u00a0of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia.\u00a0 \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"",
      "For instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.",
      "Some Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.",
      "\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.",
      "With the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"",
      "Also on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "A decline in manufacturing jobs",
      "The U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.",
      "But the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.",
      "The downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.",
      "It's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.",
      "Progress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.",
      "\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\"",

      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added.

      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next decision on interest rates in September, and some analysts are already calling for a rate cut with the US economy seeing three straight months of weak jobs growth. Hammack admits waiting too long to cut rates because of potential inflation is a risk.",
      "\"If we wait too long to cut rates, that could mean that more people are losing their jobs than we'd like to see,\" Hammack said. \"We have to balance those two factors when we're trying to decide what's right to steer the economy forward.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "When Mr. Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",
      "After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route.",
      "China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Mr. Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.",
      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that \"knowingly\" buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.",
      "\"The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China \u2014 a communist dictatorship \u2014 buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,\" Graham said in a June statement.",
      "The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",

There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down.

      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",
      "As for the economic impact that tariffs will have on the economy, Moynihan said \"no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended President Trump's decision to fire a key official responsible for employment reports, telling CBS News on Friday that Mr. Trump has \"real concerns\" about the accuracy of federal economic data.",
      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",
      "Instead, Greer argued that the numbers reflect conditions prior to the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed through Congress last month. He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

    "story": [
      "The federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.",
      "The 22 now-terminated projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Most of the projects that were canceled were for vaccines that fight COVID-19 or the flu, Kennedy\u00a0said.",
      "They include proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur and other drugmakers that were rejected or canceled, along with a now-shuttered award to Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine, according to an HHS statement. The projects were reviewed and canceled over the last few weeks, said Kennedy.",
      "A Moderna spokesperson told CBS News that the company's H5N1 (bird flu) contract was canceled in May, and it isn't aware of any new BARDA cancellations.",
      "Kennedy framed the move as part of a step away from research into mRNA vaccines. Those types of vaccines\u00a0use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce antibody production to protect against an infection. The approach has drawn more interest since the COVID-19 pandemic, when mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were\u00a0found to be safe and effective against the coronavirus. Public health officials credit the rapid development of the vaccines with saving millions of lives.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy said, \"HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\"",
      "He argued mRNA-based vaccines can stop working properly if the virus that they target mutates too much, citing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0as an example. \"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kennedy said.",
      "On Wednesday, CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked President Trump for his response to Kennedy's announcement, pointing out that the president had been the driving force behind Operation Warp Speed, the public-private partnership that developed and distributed mRNA COVID vaccines in a compressed timeline of months, rather than the years it had previously taken to produce effective vaccines.",
      "\"Everything about it has been amazing,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"but you know, that was now a long time ago, and we're onto other things. But we are speaking about it \u2014 we have meetings about it tomorrow ... we're looking for other answers to other problems, to other sicknesses and diseases.\"",
      "Jerome Adams, who was surgeon general during Mr. Trump's first term,\u00a0condemned\u00a0Kennedy's announcement in a post on X.",
      "\"I've tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions \u2013 but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives,\" Adams wrote. \"mRNA technology has uses that go far beyond vaccines\u2026 and the vaccine they helped develop in record time is credited with saving millions.\"",
      "He noted that researchers are developing mRNA applications in therapies and vaccines for flu, RSV, HIV, Zika, cancer and autoimmune diseases, and said the U.S. should be \"doubling down on what works - not defunding it.\"",
      "Leading infectious disease experts criticized the decision and said it will leave Americans vulnerable.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a virologist and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Kennedy \"has once again made a decision, not based on scientific evidence that puts this country at unnecessary risk.\"",
      "Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm called it \"one of the worst decisions I've seen in 50 years of public health preparedness work.\"",
      "\"If an influenza pandemic hit us tomorrow, the global flu vaccine manufacturing capacity using the standard method of growing the virus in chicken eggs would only produce enough vaccine in 18 months to vaccinate just one fourth of the world,\" he told CBS News. \"We desperately need a vaccine technology where we could make enough vaccine for the world in a year.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 a physician who chairs the Senate health committee \u2014 called Kennedy's decision \"unfortunate\" and said he's \"wasting the money which is already invested.\"",
      "\"He has also conceded to China an important technology needed to combat cancer and infectious disease,\" Cassidy wrote on X.",
      "Many experts say a major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed, manufactured and changed quickly, allowing drugmakers and public health officials to respond rapidly to novel viruses and to constantly mutating viruses like the flu.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration funded the development of Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed significantly faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "\"No other nation matched what America achieved during the pandemic,\" Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told CBS News. \"We pioneered and delivered life-saving mRNA vaccines at unprecedented speed. It's a historic accomplishment we should celebrate. Clinging to outdated technologies to counter a future flu pandemic is a grave mistake.\"",
      "Kennedy has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about vaccines. Since he joined the Trump administration, he has fired members of an expert panel that made vaccine recommendations, and announced the removal of a recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says children may get the vaccine and that it is safe and beneficial for pregnant women.",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that HHS is moving the now-canceled funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",
      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" the health secretary said.",

    "story": [
      "Hate crime charges have been filed against the man accused in the shooting deaths of\u00a0two Israeli Embassy staffers\u00a0in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.",
      "A grand jury on Wednesday indicted Elias Rodriguez, 31, on the additional counts of hate crimes resulting in death. The indictment includes\u00a0special findings\u00a0which would allow the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty in the case.",
      "Rodriguez is already charged with two counts of first-degree murder, murder of foreign officials and other counts for the shooting that killed Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, two employees at the Israeli Embassy in Washington who were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21.",
      "He is also charged with causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said at the time of the shooting that the attack was being investigated as a hate crime and terrorism.",
      "President Trump has sought to expand the use of the death penalty, directing his Justice Department to seek capital punishment \"for all crimes of a severity demanding its use\" in a January executive order. Under federal law, the death penalty is only permitted for certain crimes like homicide or treason, and some aggravating factor \u2014 like murdering a diplomat or kidnapping resulting in murder \u2014 must be present.",
      "According to charging documents, video shows that after Rodriguez allegedly shot the couple, he walked closer to them and fired \"several more times.\" Milgrim sat up after being shot, and he reloaded his weapon and fired again at her, striking her, the documents allege.",
      "In all, 21 rounds were fired from a 9 mm weapon, according to the court documents. A firearm magazine was found at the scene, and a handgun with its slide locked was found nearby.",
      "Federal officials traced the weapon and say records show it was purchased by Rodriguez on March 6, 2020, in Illinois. The handgun was purchased legally, according to a person briefed on the investigation.",
      "Once officers arrived at the museum, Rodriguez asked to speak with police and told them, \"I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed,\" according to the charging documents. Rodriguez was then taken into custody.",
      "FBI Washington Assistant Director Steven Jensen said the suspect, who lived in Chicago, came to Washington, D.C., on May 20 and was traveling for a work conference. He flew from Chicago O'Hare Airport to Reagan National Airport with the firearm in checked luggage and had declared the firearm, according to court documents.",

      "Mr. Trump's comments came just days before his Friday deadline for Russia to either strike a ceasefire deal with Ukraine or face sanctions. Putin met with Mr. Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow earlier Wednesday. The U.S. president called the hourslong meeting \"highly productive\" and wrote that \"great progress was made\" in a Truth Social post \u2014 a change of tone after Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Russia for much of last month.",

      "Asked about the Witkoff-Putin meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: \"We'll have some other discussions throughout the day, and then hopefully there'll be some announcements here fairly soon. Maybe positive, maybe not. We'll see.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire, but he has oscillated between blaming Putin and Zelenskyy for a lack of progress. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has grown irritated with Putin over Russia's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities.",

According to the department, he laundered money for the criminal group through concerts and events. The CDN is one of several Latin American organized crime groups that the Trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",

      "In recent months, the Trump administration has revoked the visas of a slew of artists related to the genre. In May, the famous northern Mexican band Grupo Firme, which has taken steps to distance itself from the cartel-centric themes of the genre, announced it would have to cancel an upcoming show in California because its visas were suspended.",
      "In April, the administration said it was revoking the visas of the band Alegres de Barranco after they flashed the face of a cartel boss behind them at a concert, prompting a controversy and even criminal investigations in Mexico. In June, the band released an anti-narco song in a bid to clear its name.",

      "Nineteen-year-old Coristine \u2014 who is known for his online moniker \"Big Balls\" \u2014 was allegedly surrounded and assaulted by a group of approximately 10 teenagers near his car early Sunday morning, according to a report from the Metropolitan Police Department. Two 15-year-olds were arrested and charged with unarmed carjacking.",

Police officers who were patrolling the area spotted the incident and stepped out of their cruiser, leading most of the teens to flee on foot, but two of the assailants were stopped, identified by Coristine and arrested.",
      "The two arrestees were identified by police only as a 15-year-old male and a 15-year-old female from Hyattsville, Maryland. Police said in a statement that \"multiple suspects remain outstanding.\"",
      "Emergency medical services did not transport anybody as part of the incident, D.C. Fire and EMS told CBS News.",
      "A black iPhone 16 was also stolen, the report said.",
      "Prior to the police report's release, Mr. Trump posted about the incident on Truth Social, sharing a photo of what appeared to be a bloodied \"incredible young man\" whom he said was \"beaten mercilessly by local thugs.\" Billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 the former leader of DOGE \u2014 later said the victim was a member of DOGE. He wrote that the staffer spotted a group of people allegedly attempting to assault a young woman, and \"ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion,\" although Musk's description of the incident did not align with the police report and the extent of Coristine's injuries was unclear.",

      "\"If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has backed the idea of federalizing D.C. in the past. The Constitution gives Congress the power to govern the city, but since 1973, the federal government has allowed D.C. residents to elect a mayor and city council that handle most aspects of local government. The city's autonomy is still limited, with Congress maintaining the right to override local laws \u2014 and Congress could choose to repeal the city's 52-year-old self-rule.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for D.C., said in a statement: \"It's time we start taking crime more seriously irrespective of the age of the criminal.

      "Overall, violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the last year and a half after spiking in 2023, according to data from the\u00a0DC police. So far in 2025, robberies have dropped by 29% and overall violent crime is down 26% as of\u00a0August 6. That follows declines in 2024, when violent crime in D.C. hit the lowest level in\u00a0over 30 years.\u00a0 This trend mirrors a broader nationwide decline in violent crime\u00a0last year.",
      "Coristine was one of the best-known members of Musk's DOGE team, which swept through the federal government earlier this year in an effort to cut government spending. He was involved in DOGE efforts at the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Social Security Administration, Health and Human Services and other agencies.",
      "Coristine resigned from the federal government in late June. He rejoined federal service days later as a special government employee with the Social Security Administration, which told CBS News at the time he would focus on \"improving the functionality of the Social Security website.\"",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency is considering terminating its $7 billion Solar for All program that was designed to bring renewable and affordable energy to low-income communities, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Solar for All program provides funding to 60 grant recipients that planned to create or expand existing low-income solar programs, with the goal of enabling 900,000 households across the country in disadvantaged communities to utilize solar energy to reduce their home energy bills.",
      "CBS News has learned that the Office of Management and Budget reached out to the EPA about terminating the program. The EPA has not come to a final decision on the future of the program.",
      "\"With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is working to ensure Congressional intent is fully implemented in accordance with the law,\" an EPA spokesperson told CBS News via email when asked if the agency intends to terminate Solar for All.",
      "As of Tuesday night, none of the 60 grant recipients have been formally notified and said they still have access to grant funds. One source told CBS News that several senators, both Republicans and Democrats, have reached out to the EPA and asked it to reconsider, as many of these recipients are state energy and environmental offices in both red and blue states.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report the news.",
      "Groundswell, a nonprofit Solar for All grant recipient that works in eight Southern states, has more than $156 million in grant funding on the line. To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth over $20 million.",
      "\"This program covers every single state and U.S. territories, more than 60% of the awards went to state energy offices,\" Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore told CBS News. Moore was quick to point out that awards were granted to stakeholders in both red and blue states, adding: \"There's a lot at stake here.\"",
      "As electricity bills rise, which experts believe may only increase as more energy-hungry data centers come online, Moore saw Solar for All as a tool to lower energy costs in the South.",
      "\"Solar for All is an investment in energy infrastructure that's going to serve that residential customer that's going to keep energy rates in America more affordable and more fair,\" she said.",
      "Solar for All awarded grants in August 2024 to 49 state-level agencies, six tribes and five multi-state award recipients, according to the EPA. They include state agencies like the Alaska Energy Authority, which was granted a $62 million award to offer access to renewable energy in both urban and rural areas. Harris County, Texas, which encompasses Houston, was awarded $249 million to provide distributed solar and battery storage to disadvantaged communities in the state, and plan on using the money to support workforce training for low-income residents as well as minority and women-owned businesses.",
      "\"Solar for All was a focused program where grants were used to help low- and middle-income households reduce their household electricity costs by up to 20% through solar and storage,\" said Zealan Hoover, who was a senior adviser to former EPA administrator Michael Regan in the Biden administration.

      "Blackburn came to the Senate in 2019, after representing Tennessee in the House since 2003. Her 2018 Senate bid gained added national attention when Taylor Swift, who had previously stayed out of politics, criticized Blackburn's voting record and endorsed her opponent.

      "If elected, Blackburn would become the first woman to serve as Tennessee governor. The 73-year-old has touted her background as a staunch conservative and an ally of President Trump, lauding the president in her campaign announcement for making \"historic strides in Making America Great Again\" in his return to the White House, while adding that \"he's going to need strong conservative governors who can bring that revolution home.\"",

      "Blackburn's announcement marks the latest governor bid from a U.S. senator, as a number of lawmakers have expressed interest in leaving Washington to lead their home states in recent months.

      "Abbott filed the emergency petition with the Texas Supreme Court to have Wu, who represents Houston and serves as Democratic caucus chair, removed from office. On Sunday, the governor had threatened to seek Democratic lawmakers' removal from office if they did not attend a Monday afternoon House session.",
      "\"They have not returned and have not met the quorum requirements. Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans,\" Abbott wrote in a statement. \"Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences.\"",
      "Abbott claims Wu has forfeited his elected position and that his actions, as well as those of other House Democrats who left the state, \"constitute abandonment of their office, justifying their removal.\"",
      "The governor also alleged Wu and other House Democrats \"appear to have solicited and received certain benefits in exchange for skipping a vote, further supporting their removal from office and allegations of bribery.\"",
      "Abbott has argued in the past that Democrats can be legally removed from office if they don't show up. He's cited a non-binding 2021 opinion by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that said a \"district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.\"",
      "But Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor, has told CBS News the only way to remove a Texas lawmaker \u2014 other than at the ballot box \u2014 is by a two-thirds vote of the legislature.",

      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. During a previous walkout by Democratic legislators, the Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",
      "Rep. Wu responds to Gov. Abbott's lawsuit",
      "In a statement to CBS Texas, Wu said that \u00a0\"denying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment\" of office, rather it was \"a fulfillment of my oath.\"",

      "Wu also said that the governor has failed the people of Texas and is \"using the courts to punish those who refused to fail\" with him.",
      "\"When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\" Wu's statement reads. \"When that governor holds disaster relief for 137 dead Texans and their families hostage, my moral duty is to sound the alarm \u2014 by any means necessary.\"",

      "In her interview with the Justice Department, Maxwell did not implicate President Trump in Jeffrey Epstein's misdeeds and said nothing that would harm the president, according to a source familiar with the contents of the interview. This was first reported by ABC News.",
      "An administration official also confirmed there is an audio recording and transcript of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's conversation with Maxwell, a standard practice for legal interviews.",
      "Maxwell \u2014 who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting, grooming and sexually abusing minors \u2014 is challenging her conviction, arguing she should've been covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors in Florida offered to Epstein and any co-conspirators almost two decades ago. The Supreme Court indicated it will consider whether to hear Maxwell's case in September.",

      "In a court filing last week, the Justice Department admitted that the grand jury transcripts that it is attempting to unseal from the investigations into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell contain testimony from only two law enforcement officers.",

      "The attorneys said victims' names and identifying information should be redacted, but the court shouldn't \"rubber stamp\" redactions about others who might be mentioned in the transcripts.",
      "Earlier this week, two other unnamed Epstein victims also asked for restrictions to be put in place to protect Epstein and Maxwell's victims, but were unopposed to the transcripts being unsealed.",
      "One victim asked for the judge to \"show us all the files with only the necessary redactions!\" and \"be done with it and allow me/us to heal.\"",

      "The injunction by U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns in Boston followed a July lawsuit brought by 20 states. They argued that FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program had been unlawfully terminated in April 2025 under the Trump administration, with more than $4 billion in unspent funding that had been allocated by Congress redirected without its authority. Stearns wrote that the court was \"not convinced\" that Congress had intended for the money to be reallocated.",
      "\"The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,\" Stearns wrote.",
      "Stearns ruled that government officials were temporarily blocked from repurposing the funds while the court considers the state's objections to the cuts.",
      "The July lawsuit alleged that ending the BRIC program would upend disaster preparedness efforts across the country, leaving communities unable to tap into critical funding for hundreds of already-approved resilience projects. Before it was halted, the BRIC program provided funding for local infrastructure projects such as stormwater management systems and the relocation or elevation of buildings in flood-prone zones.",
      "FEMA officials originally announced in April that they were \"ending\" the BRIC program because it is \"wasteful\" and had become more concerned with \"political agendas than helping Americans recover from natural disasters.\" But in a court filing last week, the disaster response agency walked back those comments, stating that they hadn't cut the program and were still evaluating whether they will end or revise it.",
      "A CBS News investigation\u00a0in June revealed that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, with two-thirds of the counties that lost funding having voted for the president. The elimination of the BRIC program will especially deprive vulnerable communities across the Southeast \u2014 an area prone to natural disasters \u2014 the CBS News data analysis found."

This year's report used data submitted by 16,675 different agencies, which the FBI said covers a combined population of more than 325 million people, or about 95.6% of U.S. residents.",
      "The FBI's report did not venture to say why the violent crime stats decreased. \"It's difficult if not impossible for us to say why, and each reporting agency would have a different reason why,\" an FBI official said Tuesday in response to a question from CBS News during a briefing.",
      "The FBI did note it has seen an increase in the number of officers shot in the line of duty. \"Between 2021 and 2024, we saw 258 law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty,\" the FBI official said.",
      "All violent crime decreased last year",
      "Violent crime, which the FBI defines as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was down an estimated 4.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, with each subcategory also seeing a decrease.",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate decreased 14.9% year over year. Robbery dropped by 8.9%. Rape saw an estimated 5.2% decrease and aggravated assault was down 3%, the report found",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate dropped for a second straight year, after dropping from 6.5 to 5.7 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023. In 2024, the rate dropped again, to 5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Over the last 20 years, the high mark in the murder rate was recorded in 2020, with 6.7 per 100,000 residents, while the lowest recorded was in 2014, with 4.4 cases per 100,000 people.",
      "Analysis from Jeff Asher, a criminal justice data expert and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics, noted that while murder, rape and robberies have fallen to below pre-COVID levels following a large spike during the pandemic, aggravated assaults, while decreasing, remain \"stubbornly high.\"",
      "In a shift from previous years, both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office contributed data to the FBI report.",
      "LAPD Chief of Detectives Alan S. Hamilton credited community and violence intervention programs in Los Angeles for contributing to the drop in crime there. \"We made an investment in the future and I think these are the dividends,\" he told CBS News in a phone call Monday night.",
      "Rodney Harrison, former police commissioner of New York's Suffolk County and a CBS News law enforcement contributor, said some of the drops in violent crime could be attributed to criminals shifting their efforts to online crimes like identity theft.",
      "\"If they don't have to go out on the street and run drugs and can make money sitting at the computer, some criminals will do that, which presents a new challenge to police,\" Harrison told CBS News.",
      "Property crime also down",
      "Property crime also saw a considerable decrease of 8.1% in 2024, the FBI report found, following a 2.4% drop in 2023.",
      "Of note, motor vehicle thefts decreased by 18.6% from 2023 to 2024 following several years of increases. It's the largest one-year drop ever recorded in that category, although the overall rate of car thefts is still higher than it was in 2019, according to Asher.",
      "Other subcategories of property crime include burglary, down 8.6%, and larceny-theft, down 5.5%.",
      "The overall property crime rate in 2024 was the lowest recorded since 1961, according to the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "Hate crimes",
      "The FBI also included data on hate crimes, based on reports from 16,419 law enforcement agencies. In 2024, those departments reported 11,679 criminal incidents and 13,683 related offenses motivated by bias based on race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender or gender identity.",
      "The overall number of such incidents decreased slightly in 2024 compared to 2023, although the FBI noted there can be fluctuations when looking at different groups.",
      "While the FBI report did not give a breakdown of the targets of hate crimes, CBS News has been tracking an increase in reported antisemitic hate crimes in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack in Israel and the subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have also been on the rise in the same time period.",
      "The Secure Community Network, which helps to track antisemitic incidents across the country, said roughly 69% of the reported religiously motivated incidents in 2024 were antisemitic, targeting Jewish people or institutions.",
      "Downward trend continuing",
      "While the FBI's report is focused on 2024, statistics for the current year are available and show a continuing downward trend, according to analysis from the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "The homicide rate continued to decline in the first half of 2025, lowering the rate in the U.S. to a level it hasn't seen in a decade, the CCJ said. Although the group noted that while the overall numbers are going down, many cities are still seeing higher homicide rates than they did in the first half of 2019.",
      "\"These numbers are promising but not surprising,\" Ernesto Lopez, senior research specialist at the CCJ, told CBS News. \"After significant increases in violent crime starting in 2020, the decline in all major crime types across all sizes of jurisdictions is promising. These trends are closely aligned with our own findings, which show crime falling last year and continuing to fall in the first six months of 2025.\"",
      "The council also noted the limitations of the FBI's data, which doesn't cover the entire U.S. population and only measures crimes that are reported to law enforcement. Advocates for victims of sexual assault, for example, often note that many rapes go unreported.",
      "\"The police data is critical, but it's also important to remember that most crimes are not reported to police, so the overall volume is much higher than what's represented here,\" the CCJ told CBS News.",
      "Laura  Geller, \n                                                  \n                                  Ash-har  Quraishi and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-agents-directed-to-stop-deportations-under-trumps-asylum-ban-after-court-order/",
    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, lifting a sweeping policy that had effectively closed the U.S. asylum system to many migrants, two officials told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, following a federal court order that said the measure could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum-seekers, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.",
      "The move effectively lifts a sweeping policy that had closed the American asylum system to those entering the U.S. illegally or without proper documents. It's a measure the second Trump administration has credited for a steep drop in illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, where officials last month reported the lowest monthly level of migrant apprehensions on record.",
      "Mr. Trump's asylum crackdown was unprecedented in scope. The proclamation underpinning it, issued just hours after he returned to the White House in January, gave U.S. border officials the power to summarily deport migrants without allowing them to request asylum, a right enshrined in American law for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said the extraordinary action was necessary due to what he called an \"invasion\" of migrants under the Biden administration, which faced record levels of illegal crossings at the southern border until it too restricted asylum last year.",
      "On Friday, a federal appeals court lifted its pause on a lower judge's ruling that found Mr. Trump's decree violated U.S. asylum laws. While the appellate court narrowed the lower court's order, saying Mr. Trump's proclamation could be used to pause access to the asylum system, it also ruled the U.S. government could not disregard other laws that bar officials from deporting migrants to places where they could be tortured or persecuted.",
      "Those laws require the U.S. to grant legal protections \u2014 known as \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture \u2014 to migrants who prove they would likely face persecution or torture if deported to their home countries. Unlike asylum, those protections do not allow recipients to get permanent U.S. residency or protect them from being deported to a third party country.",
      "Officials at Customs and Border Protection were instructed this weekend to halt deportations under Mr. Trump's proclamation and to process migrants under U.S. immigration law, which affords foreigners on American soil the right to request humanitarian refuge, the two DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss an internal directive.",
      "CBP officials received instructions to process migrants through different mechanisms, including through a fast-track deportation procedure known as expedited removal, according to the DHS officials. While expedited removal allows for relatively quick deportations, migrants processed under the policy are also allowed to apply for asylum if they convince officials that their fears of being harmed if deported are credible.",
      "For months, U.S. border agents had been using Mr. Trump's asylum ban to swiftly deport those crossing into the country illegally to Mexico, their home countries and, in some cases, third party nations that had agreed to accept them. Internally, officials have dubbed those deportations \"212(f) repatriations,\" in reference to the legal authority Mr. Trump invoked in his proclamation.",
      "While the lifting of Mr. Trump's order may reopen the U.S. asylum system, those caught crossing the southern border illegally will likely remain detained while officials vet their claims. The Trump administration has largely stopped the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their court dates, limiting releases to cases involving extraordinary circumstances.",
      "The Justice Department could also try to get Friday's court order suspended by the Supreme Court, in a bid to revive Mr. Trump's asylum ban.",
      "In a statement to CBS News late Monday, CBP said Friday's court order affirmed \"the President's authority to deny asylum to aliens participating in an invasion into the United States.\"",
      "CBP said the Trump administration is \"committed to ensuring that aliens illegally entering the United States face consequences for their criminal actions.\"",
      "\"This includes prosecution to the fullest extent of the law and rapid removal from the United States,\" the agency added. \"CBP will continue to process illegal/inadmissible aliens consistent with law, including mandatory detention and expedited removal.\"",
      "After soaring to record levels in late 2023, illegal border crossings dropped sharply in former President Biden's last year office, following increased efforts by Mexico to interdict U.S.-bound migrants and an order issued by Biden in June 2024 to restrict access to the American asylum system. But they have plunged even further since Mr. Trump took office for a second time.",
      "In July, Border Patrol encountered just 4,600 migrants along the southern border, the lowest monthly tally ever publicly reported by the agency. It's also a figure the Biden administration recorded in 24 hours on many days.",

    "summary": "A CBS News review of three of DOGE's largest cuts claimed so far found actual savings of 3% of what was claimed.",
    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump whether he sees Vance as the \"heir apparent to MAGA.\" The president responded that Vance is \"most likely\" the leading contender.",
      "\"It's too early, obviously, to talk about it. But certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point,\" the president said during an unrelated executive order-signing ceremony.",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and suggested he's \"somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form.\" And he said the Republican Party has some other \"incredible people.\"",
      "The president has singled out Rubio and Vance in the past, but has mostly avoided choosing a favorite. He praised both men in a May interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" and said he didn't \"want to get involved\" in picking a leader, though he noted that the vice president would typically \"have an advantage.\"",
      "Vance and Rubio are both seen as possible contenders for the 2028 GOP presidential nomination. The two\u00a0were once vehement Trump critics \u2014 with Rubio running against\u00a0Mr. Trump in the 2016 GOP primaries \u2014 but they have repositioned themselves as allies and defenders of the president since then.",
      "At least publicly, both men have been coy about their political ambitions. Late last month, Rubio downplayed the possibility of a presidential run in an interview\u00a0on Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump,\" which is hosted by the president's daughter-in-law. Rubio said he thinks Vance \"would be a great nominee if he decides he wants to do that,\" adding that he'd be satisfied if secretary of state ended up being \"the apex of my career.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday to a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton, for testimony about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The subpoenas seeking depositions from the former Justice Department officials were issued after Republicans and Democrats on a House Oversight subcommittee approved measures to authorize the demands last month as part of efforts by Congress to obtain more information about Epstein.",
      "House investigators also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate who is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The department confirmed it received the subpoena but did not comment further.",
      "The committee is seeking testimony from Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as from officials spanning the past four presidential administrations: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller. Sessions and Barr led the Justice Department during President Trump's first term. Lawmakers are seeking information from the Clintons because of the former president's past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "Letters to the officials from Kentucky Rep. James Comer, a Republican who leads the Oversight Committee, are all similar. The records from the Justice Department must be turned over by Aug. 19, according to the Oversight committee, and depositions are scheduled for throughout August, September and October.",
      "\"While the Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell's cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,\" Comer wrote, adding that the Oversight panel \"may use the results of this investigation to inform legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton said in 2019 after Epstein was indicted on federal charges that the former president took four trips on Epstein's plane in 2002 and 2003, traveling to Europe, Asia and Africa. Angel Ure\u00f1a, the spokesperson, said the trips included stops in connection with the Clinton Foundation, and staff, foundation supporters, and Clinton's Secret Service detail were on every leg of every trip. Clinton also had a meeting with Epstein in 2002 and made \"one brief visit\" to Epstein's apartment with a staff member and his secretary detail, Ure\u00f1a said.",
      "\"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago or those with which he has been recently charged in New York,\" he said, adding that Clinton hadn't spoken to Epstein in more than a decade and had never been to his island, New Mexico ranch or Florida residence.",
      "Former presidents have not successfully been compelled to testify before Congress, but several have voluntarily answered questions from committees, including Presidents Gerald Ford in 1983, Harry Truman in 1955 and William Howard Taft on numerous occasions,\u00a0according to the Senate.",
      "Epstein was charged with federal sex trafficking crimes in 2019 and died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial. He had been investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, though that ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "But Congress has renewed its focus on Epstein after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo\u00a0last month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" of prominent figures and confirmed he died by suicide. The memo also found that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they did not plan to release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "The findings rankled some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who are skeptical that there is nothing else regarding Epstein's case to make public. Amid the backlash, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell late last month for two days in Tallahassee, where she was serving her sentence before being moved to a minimum-security facility in Texas last week.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. An appeal of her conviction is currently awaiting action from the Supreme Court. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell\u00a0for testimony last month and set a deposition for Aug. 11. But Comer offered to delay the interview while the Supreme Court considers whether to take up her case. The justices are set to weigh her petition at a closed-door conference Sept. 29, but do not have to act on it immediately.",
      "Comer said the committee will \"engage in good faith negotiations\" around the deposition, but would not grant her congressional immunity or send her its questions in advance \u2014 two requests by Maxwell's attorney.",
      "Blanche and Bondi have also asked federal judges in New York to unseal transcripts from the grand jury proceedings in Epstein and Maxwell's cases, though federal rules typically require matters before grand juries to be kept secret.",
      "Beyond the moves by the Justice Department, lawmakers have pushed for files related to Epstein to be released to the public. A clash of House members over the material led the House to scrap votes and leave Washington early for its monthlong summer recess.",
      "House Republicans put forth a non-binding resolution last month to make the files from the federal probe into Epstein public, but Speaker Mike Johnson said the lower chamber would not vote on it until September, when lawmakers return from their break.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department published a list of 35 \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions on Tuesday, vowing to bring lawsuits against states, counties and cities that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents.",
      "\"Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.\"",
      "The Justice Department put 12 states on its list \u2014 California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington \u2014 and the District of Columbia. It also included Baltimore County, Maryland; Cook County, Illinois; San Diego County, California; and San Francisco County, California, along with 18 cities from Seattle to Philadelphia.",

      "Under the order, the Justice Department was to notify each jurisdiction of \"its defiance of Federal immigration law enforcement.\" If the jurisdiction continued to be in defiance, the order directed the Justice Department to \"pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to end these violations and bring such jurisdictions into compliance with the laws of the United States.\"",
      "The Justice Department has taken legal action against a number of sanctuary jurisdictions in recent months,\u00a0suing\u00a0New York City in July to challenge its sanctuary city laws.

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "The flash \u2014 dubbed a \"megaflash,\" or a single continuous long horizontal flash that can initiate up to hundreds of cloud-to-ground strikes \u2014 happened on Oct. 22, 2017, according to a research report published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. While the storm that day had previously been analyzed by scientists, new satellite technology recently documented the megaflash exceeding 500 miles.",
      "The previous world record recognized by the World Meteorological Organization was a megaflash on April 29, 2020, extending 477 miles across the southern United States and the Gulf of Mexico, the researchers said.",
      "While the 2017 megaflash may be the longest in horizontal distance, it did not have the longest duration. Researchers estimated that it lasted just over 7 seconds. The current WMO-recognized record for longest duration megaflash occurred over Argentina and Uruguay in June 2020 and was about 17 seconds.",
      "Researchers hope the technology that identified the 2017 megaflash will continue to help them evaluate more storms.",
      "\"We're excited to see what kinds of lightning come out of this new work, and especially as technology improves and we are able to get satellites and other parts of the world, then we'll be able to expand towards the eventual vision of providing global coverage of lightning,\" said Michael Peterson, the report's lead author and a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech Research Institute.",

      "Catching up from behind and below, the Crew 11 Dragon Endeavour looped up ahead of the lab complex, then to a point directly above the outpost before slowly moving straight in for a linkup at the space-facing port of the forward Harmony module at 2:27 a.m. ET as the two spacecraft orbited 264 miles above the south Pacific Ocean.",
      "Hooks and latches then engaged, pulling the Crew Dragon's nose firmly into the docking mechanism, which locked the craft in place. Umbilicals automatically connected and flight controllers began a series of leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal.",
      "\"Endeavour, welcome to the International Space Station,\" called NASA astronaut Jonny Kim from inside the ISS. \"Zena, Mike, Kimi and Oleg, we have cold drinks, hot food and hugs waiting. See you soon.\"",
      "\"Hello space station, Crew 11 is here!\" Endeavour pilot Mike Fincke, a three-flight veteran, enthusiastically replied. \"And we are super excited to join Expedition 73. We will do our best to also be good stewards of our beautiful ISS during our stay. The ISS has been inhabited and crewed for almost 25 years. We look forward to celebrating with you.\"",
      "Nearly three hours later, after doffing their spacesuits and configuring their capsule for docked operations, Fincke, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, Japanese veteran Kimiya Yui and rookie cosmonaut Oleg Platonov floated through the forward hatch to be welcomed aboard by the space station's seven-member crew.",
      "\"We are so happy to see your smiling faces,\" said ISS commander Takuya Onishi. \"Zena, Oleg, congratulations on your first spaceflight. We are looking forward to hearing your impressions and your feelings about that. Mike and Kimiya, welcome back. Your experience will be an invaluable asset for Expedition 73.\"",
      "Cardman was bumped from a Crew Dragon flight last year to help NASA bring two Starliner astronauts back to Earth after problems prevented them from coming home on their own spacecraft. She was clearly thrilled to finally be aboard the space station.",
      "\"This has been the absolute journey of a lifetime,\" she said with a broad smile. \"We are so incredibly grateful to be here. Thank you so much for this warm welcome. It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time, especially with these wonderful crewmates.\"",
      "With the arrival of Crew 11, four of the station's crew members \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 will be clear to undock and return to Earth next Wednesday to close out a 145-day mission.",
      "The other three \u2014 Kim and Soyuz MS-27/73S crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky \u2014 will remain aboard with Cardman and company to continue Expedition 73.",
      "Until now, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit with Crew 11.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25% while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money.",
      "No final decisions have been made. But NASA is assessing the possibility of extending Crew 11's stay in space from six to eight months, depending on the actual funding outlook.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" Cardman said before launch. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9's first stage engines shut down, the stage dropped away and the flight to orbit continued on the power of the single Merlin engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around and reversed course, flying itself back to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, chalking up SpaceX's 65th Florida landing and its 484th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "One minute after landing, the second stage engine shut down and the Crew Dragon Endeavour was released to fly on its own.",
      "Had the crew launched Thursday, it would have taken them nearly 40 hours to catch up with the space station. With a launch Friday, the trip was expected to take just 16 hours, setting up a docking at the forward Harmony module's space-facing port at 3 a.m. Saturday \u2014 the same time they would have docked had they launched Thursday.",
      "For Cardman, the trip to space finally fulfills a dream she had hoped to accomplish last year when she came within a month or so of launching to the space station as commander of an earlier Crew Dragon flight.",
      "But she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex in June 2024 in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "Wilson has not yet been assigned another flight, but Cardman was tapped to command of Crew 11.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" she said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",

      "Platonov, making his first flight, was assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program. The arrangement is intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it.",

      "Clothing and personal items for Cardman are already on board, launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, her 38th, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",

      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking.

      "The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.",

      "\"What all vehicles in top 20 have in common is that they are relatively expensive, relatively powerful and in many cases they are pickup trucks,\" Matt Moore, chief insurance operations officer at HLDI, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",
      "The Camaro models have another feature that make them vulnerable: on-board ports that contain vehicle data, such as fuel emissions and performance stats, but can also serve as a point of entry for thieves.",
      "\"In the case of Camaro ZL1, it is very desirable to thieves, and, on top of it, there's a vulnerability that makes them relatively easy to steal,\" Moore said.",
      "\"Due to the vulnerability, with the right knowledge and right bits of technology, someone who can gain access to the inside of one of these Camaros can steal it relatively easily,\" Moore said, noting that he didn't want to describe the process more precisely so as not to encourage thieves.",

    "story": [
      "New Orleans \u2014 Louisiana's coast is under threat as a quarter of the state's wetlands, an area about the size of Delaware, have disappeared in the last 100 years, according to the\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "The wetlands are a critical buffer that shield Louisiana communities from monster hurricanes.",
      "While massive flood walls and human-made marshes are helpful, coastal scientist  Alisha Renfro and campaign director  Simone Maloz with the nonprofit group Restore the Mississippi River Delta say say those projects alone are not enough to rebuild and counteract future projected land loss.",
      "\"You can reduce storm surge up to a foot with just a mile of coastal wetlands,\" Renfro told CBS News.",
      "\"A tough lesson that we learned after Katrina: we have to think long term. We also have to think bigger,\" Maloz added.",
      "It's been 20 years since Hurricane Katrina exposed the extent of the state's coastal erosion. \u00a0It was the largest residential disaster in U.S. history, killing more than 1,300 people and displacing one million others across the Gulf Coast, according to the Louisiana independent research nonprofit The Data Center.",
      "Since Katrina,\u00a0satellite images\u00a0from the NASA Earth Observatory show that the Louisiana coastline has lost even more marshland \u2014 an estimated 200,000 acres, according to the USGS.",
      "Land loss is caused by a number of factors, including sea level rise, shipping channels, levees, natural subsidence, invasive species and severe storms, according to Restore the Mississippi River Delta.",
      "Without the protection of wetlands, Maloz and Renfro say the future would be unsustainable for coastal Louisiana communities.",
      "\"I think that's a future we don't want to think about,\" Maloz said of the impact on the region if the wetlands were to disappear.",
      "\"It is a loss of culture,\" Renfro said. \"It is a loss of place and it is a loss of home for a lot of people.\"",
      "Last month, Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project\u00a0\u2014 known as the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion \u2014 that sought to rebuild the marshes.",
      "Renfro and Maloz spent years planning the diversion project with other state and federal leaders and scientists. The project was unique, because instead of a human-made marsh built by dredged sediment, it would have diverted sediment flowing down the Mississippi River to naturally rebuild wetlands, the way the Mississippi River Delta was first formed centuries ago.",
      "Renfro and Maloz saw it as the best solution to save Louisiana. They argue that other projects wouldn't be nearly as effective, nor would they have rebuilt as much land.",
      "\"If you don't change the forces that took that away from you in the first place... if you don't have a systemic change, then you're going to lose this too,\" Maloz said. \"And so that's what Mid-Barataria represented. It represented that systemic change that returned back to how we were created that gave us that long-term future. If you want to talk about dollars and cents, you're talking about investing money over 50 years, rather than investing X amount of money over 10 years or 20 years. But really it's the time and scale.\"",
      "The project would have diverted Mississippi sediment to rebuild 17,000 acres of land over the next 30 years, enough to potentially absorb up to 10 feet of storm surge, according to Restore the Mississippi River Delta.",
      "\"We are very short on money,\" Maloz added. \"We're short on natural resources. And we are short on time.\"",
      "Regardless, Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority scrapped the project this summer, at the direction of Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, even though about $600 million of the $3 billion had already been spent.",
      "The project faced stark opposition from many community members in Plaquemines Parish, a small parish south of New Orleans.",
      "Mitch Jurisich, a third-generation oysterman, local businessman, and Plaquemines Parish councilman, filed a lawsuit to stop the project. He told CBS News he did so \"because I know what it would have done to our fishing industry, our commercial fishing industry here. And when you look around at this harbor, full of commercial boats, full of life, it would have just totally wiped us out.\"",
      "Documents for the project published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers show it would have had some negative impacts on fisheries near the project site at first. But Renfro says that, down the road, the fisheries would have come back stronger.",
      "Government records also showed the project would have increased flooding and storm surge to some homes south of the project site. The project would have compensated those impacted, but Jurisich believes there are better solutions that wouldn't sacrifice his community for the rest of the state.",
      "\"I tell them all, 'It's not my fault that y'all wasted money,'\" Jurisch said of state officials. \"'It's your fault, because you pushed this down our throat knowing we didn't want it.'\"",
      "Jurisich says smaller, human-made marshes could be cheaper and wouldn't sacrifice his fishing community for the rest of the state. But Renfro argues that is only a temporary fix and that the fishing industry will ultimately pay a steep price for the continued loss of the wetlands.",
      "\"They (the fishing industry) are dependent on those coastal wetlands that are disappearing,\" Renfro said. \"And once those wetlands are gone, the fisheries collapse. Doing nothing isn't an option.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Apple announced a new $100 billion commitment by Apple to boost manufacturing in the U.S.",
      "\"Today, Apple is announcing it will invest $600 billion...in the U.S. over the next four years,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday afternoon. \"That's $100 billion more than they were originally going to invest. And this is the largest investment Apple has ever made in America.\"",
      "He said the investment would create 20,000 new jobs at Apple and said the tech giant planned to build a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky.",
      "Mr. Trump called the investment \"a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America.\" He said the Apple would also build a server manufacturing facility in Houston, invest billions in constructing data centers across the country, and build a manufacturing academy in Detroit.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared at Mr. Trump's side for the announcement and presented him with a glass Apple plate he said was engraved for the president and set in a base of 24K gold.",
      "The new investment would increase Apple's commitment to U.S. manufacturing to $600 billion over the next four years, according to a White House official. And it's expected to include a new \"American Manufacturing Program\" focused on bringing more of Apple's supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement that the announcement with Apple \"will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security.\"",
      "The company announced in February that it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years and hire 20,000 U.S.-based workers. Apple said then that it would build a new 250,000 square-foot manufacturing plant in Houston, set to open in 2026, that will make servers to power Apple's AI services. The company also said it would establish an educational academy in Michigan focused on manufacturing and boost its investment in a fund aimed at fostering innovation across the U.S.",
      "In May, the president threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., writing on Truth Social that he told Cook that he expects that iPhones that will be sold in the U.S. \"will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.\"",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says the federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology.",
    "story": [
      "The federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.",
      "The 22 now-terminated projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Most of the projects that were canceled were for vaccines that fight COVID-19 or the flu, Kennedy\u00a0said.",
      "They include proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur and other drugmakers that were rejected or canceled, along with a now-shuttered award to Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine, according to an HHS statement. The projects were reviewed and canceled over the last few weeks, said Kennedy.",
      "A Moderna spokesperson told CBS News that the company's H5N1 (bird flu) contract was canceled in May, and it isn't aware of any new BARDA cancellations.",
      "Kennedy framed the move as part of a step away from research into mRNA vaccines. Those types of vaccines\u00a0use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce antibody production to protect against an infection. The approach has drawn more interest since the COVID-19 pandemic, when mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were\u00a0found to be safe and effective against the coronavirus. Public health officials credit the rapid development of the vaccines with saving millions of lives.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy said, \"HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\"",
      "He argued mRNA-based vaccines can stop working properly if the virus that they target mutates too much, citing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0as an example. \"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kennedy said.",
      "On Wednesday, CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked President Trump for his response to Kennedy's announcement, pointing out that the president had been the driving force behind Operation Warp Speed, the public-private partnership that developed and distributed mRNA COVID vaccines in a compressed timeline of months, rather than the years it had previously taken to produce effective vaccines.",
      "\"Everything about it has been amazing,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"but you know, that was now a long time ago, and we're onto other things. But we are speaking about it \u2014 we have meetings about it tomorrow ... we're looking for other answers to other problems, to other sicknesses and diseases.\"",
      "Jerome Adams, who was surgeon general during Mr. Trump's first term,\u00a0condemned\u00a0Kennedy's announcement in a post on X.",
      "\"I've tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions \u2013 but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives,\" Adams wrote. \"mRNA technology has uses that go far beyond vaccines\u2026 and the vaccine they helped develop in record time is credited with saving millions.\"",
      "He noted that researchers are developing mRNA applications in therapies and vaccines for flu, RSV, HIV, Zika, cancer and autoimmune diseases, and said the U.S. should be \"doubling down on what works - not defunding it.\"",
      "Leading infectious disease experts criticized the decision and said it will leave Americans vulnerable.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a virologist and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Kennedy \"has once again made a decision, not based on scientific evidence that puts this country at unnecessary risk.\"",
      "Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm called it \"one of the worst decisions I've seen in 50 years of public health preparedness work.\"",
      "\"If an influenza pandemic hit us tomorrow, the global flu vaccine manufacturing capacity using the standard method of growing the virus in chicken eggs would only produce enough vaccine in 18 months to vaccinate just one fourth of the world,\" he told CBS News. \"We desperately need a vaccine technology where we could make enough vaccine for the world in a year.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 a physician who chairs the Senate health committee \u2014 called Kennedy's decision \"unfortunate\" and said he's \"wasting the money which is already invested.\"",
      "\"He has also conceded to China an important technology needed to combat cancer and infectious disease,\" Cassidy wrote on X.",
      "Many experts say a major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed, manufactured and changed quickly, allowing drugmakers and public health officials to respond rapidly to novel viruses and to constantly mutating viruses like the flu.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration funded the development of Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed significantly faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "\"No other nation matched what America achieved during the pandemic,\" Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told CBS News. \"We pioneered and delivered life-saving mRNA vaccines at unprecedented speed. It's a historic accomplishment we should celebrate. Clinging to outdated technologies to counter a future flu pandemic is a grave mistake.\"",
      "Kennedy has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about vaccines. Since he joined the Trump administration, he has fired members of an expert panel that made vaccine recommendations, and announced the removal of a recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says children may get the vaccine and that it is safe and beneficial for pregnant women.",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that HHS is moving the now-canceled funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",
      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" the health secretary said.",
      "Nick  Kurtz, \n                                                  \n                                  Dr. C\u00e9line  Gounder and \n                                                  \n                      Stephanie  Stahl\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A Federal Reserve official on Wednesday called last week's\u00a0tepid jobs report \"concerning,\" and said its significant downward revisions could signal an economic shift in the U.S.",
      "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook highlighted the report's sizable downward revisions to jobs created in May and June, saying that they are \"typical of turning points\" in the economy.",
      "Friday's report showed that employers added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs in July. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, also sharply revised its job estimates for May and June, saying that the U.S. added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.",
      "After Friday's report, President Trump fired the BLS commissioner of labor statistics, claiming that the revisions undermined the data's accuracy. He added that \"Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP'.\"",
      "Revisions are a common feature of the monthly jobs reports from the BLS, which updates its data after receiving new information from businesses and other sources. Some economists said the July jobs report reflected that some companies are scaling back hiring plans amid a slowing U.S. economy and uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"There were two major revisions to May and June, and these revisions are somewhat typical of turning points, which again speak to uncertainty,\" Cook said during a Wednesday\u00a0discussion with other Fed officials on the global economic outlook.",
      "She later added, \"When we get the GDP numbers later this year, we're going to see, I can imagine, lower activity.\"",
      "Crafting effective economic policies is dependent on understanding where the economy is heading, said Cook, who prior to her appointment in 2022 as a Fed governor was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, according to her biography.",
      "\"We want to know not just where we've been, but where we're going. So if we're at an inflection point, we want to look at data that speak to inflection points,\" she added.",
      "Other Fed officials said the July jobs report may not necessarily reflect a long-term direction. On Friday, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he had questions about whether the report was a one-time issue or a trend, and added that he believes the labor market still has \"a lot of strength.\"",
      "The downward revision to May and June's hiring data marked the largest two-month downward revision outside of a recession since 1968, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.",
      "Cook also discussed what she referred to as an \"uncertainty tax\" that she said is weighing on businesses across industries. She said that executives at \"all kinds of organizations\" are spending more time on preparing for and responding to macroeconomic uncertainty. That includes discussions about pricing based on anticipated cost increases from the new tariffs.",
      "When executives spend their time this way, it's a \"deadweight loss, we're not going to see that in GDP,\" she explained.",
      "\"So there's just uncertainty across the board, but I think it's really interesting that no matter what the sector, no matter what kind of businesses they're in, they're talking about the uncertainty tax,\" Cook said.",

      "Five soldiers were wounded when an active-duty sergeant opened fire on his coworkers Wednesday at Fort Stewart in Georgia, officials said. The suspected shooter, who was taken into custody, used his personal weapon in the shooting, Brig. Gen. John Lubas, the fort's commander, told reporters.",
      "Officials identified the suspect as Quornelius Radford, a 28-year-old automated logistics sergeant with the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team. Officials\u00a0had said\u00a0the shooting happened in the combat team's area at the fort.",
      "The suspect joined the Army in January 2018 as an automated logistical specialist and is from Jacksonville, Florida, an Army spokesperson told CBS News. He hadn't previously been deployed to combat, Lubas said.",
      "The wounded soldiers were all in stable condition and expected to recover, Lubas said during an afternoon news conference. Three of the five soldiers required surgery. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the soldiers were treated on site and taken to an Army hospital. Two of the soldiers were then moved to a hospital in Savannah, Georgia, for additional care. None of the soldiers have been identified publicly.",
      "Lubas said the suspect was being held in pretrial confinement and has been interviewed by the Army's Criminal Investigative Division, a federal law enforcement agency. An investigation into the shooting was ongoing.",
      "Investigators weren't sure about the motivation for the shooting, Lubas said. He said the suspect had been arrested for DUI, which wasn't previously known to the suspect's chain of command. The gun used in the shooting was a personal weapon, not a military weapon, Lubas said.",
      "During the shooting, soldiers in the area \"immediately and without hesitation\" tackled the suspect and subdued him, Lubas said. \"These soldiers, without a doubt, prevented further casualties,\" he said.",

      "Law enforcement officers responded to initial reports of the shooting at 10:56 a.m. local time, officials said.

      "President Trump has been briefed on the shooting and the White House is monitoring the situation, press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0said\u00a0on social media. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also been briefed on the shooting, a defense official said.",
      "\"The Army Criminal Investigation Division is on site to ensure that the perpetrator of this atrocity, which is exactly what it is, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office Wednesday. \"The entire nation is praying for the victims and their families, and hopefully, they'll fully recover, and we can put this chapter behind us, but we're not going to forget what happened.\"",

    "summary": "More than 50 Texas House Democrats left the state Sunday to prevent a quorum in the state House of Representatives to move forward on a bill that would set new congressional districts\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Some of the Texas Democrats who left the state in protest of a redistricting bill were temporarily evacuated Wednesday from their Chicago-area hotel after a bomb threat, according to police and lawmakers.",
      "The hotel is in St. Charles, Illinois, west of Chicago. The St. Charles Police Department said first responders arrived at the hotel around 7:15 a.m. They \"conducted a thorough search and no device was found,\" police said.",
      "\"In response to the threat, 400 people were immediately evacuated and the area was secured as bomb squad units conducted their investigation,\" the department said in a statement. \"Following clearance from authorities, all guests and staff have safely returned to the premises.\"",
      "State Rep. Ann Johnson said in a statement that \"a bomb threat forced us to evacuate our hotel\" early Wednesday. \"Thankfully, no one was harmed,\" she added.",
      "The House Democratic caucus confirmed that a threat had been made, as did Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Pritzker said in a statement that \"threats of violence will be investigated and those responsible will be held accountable\" and that he had instructed Illinois state police to investigate.",
      "Pritzker told reporters later Wednesday that \"a right-wing podcaster who took a video of where they're staying, posted it, put a map up to point to exactly what hotel they're at.\"",
      "He said state law enforcement is conducting an investigation \"and they're going to seek out, hunt down and arrest the perpetrators.\"",
      "Texas state Rep. Ramon Romero Jr., one of the Democrats who left the state, told CBS News Chicago's Sabrina Franza: \"It's a little scary because you never know if it's credible or not, but I will tell you that the law enforcement presence was on the scene quickly.\"",
      "More than 50 Texas House Democrats left the state Sunday to prevent a quorum in the state House of Representatives to move forward on a bill that would set new congressional districts. Texas Republicans had taken up a rare mid-decade redistricting after President Trump insisted that the state's maps could be redrawn to give the GOP more of an edge. Texas currently has 38 representatives in Congress, comprised of 23 Republicans and 15 Democrats. The new maps unveiled by Texas Republicans could net the GOP up to five more seats.",
      "As the week has gone on, Texas Republicans have amped up their efforts to get the Democrats to return to give them the numbers necessary for a quorum. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office, calling him the \"ringleader\" of the quorum break.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, meanwhile, said he would ask a judge to declare the seats vacant if the Democrats did not return by Friday.",
      "Abbott had previously called for civil arrests for the Democrats, saying he had asked the Texas Department of Public Safety to bring them back so they could be present for the vote. But the Texas Department of Public Safety does not have jurisdiction out of state, leading U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, whom Paxton has challenged in the GOP primary, to write a letter to the FBI asking the agency to intervene.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the FBI \"may have to\" get involved.",

      "\"I wasn't really satisfied,\" she said last year. \"Coming off of a huge competitive career, just playing locally, I wasn't getting my fix. And I remember looking at the umpire and being like, I think that's it. I got to go for that.\"",
      "After umpiring NCAA softball from 2010-16, she attended an MLB umpire tryout camp in 2015, was invited to the Umpire Training Academy at Vero Beach, Florida, and was offered a job in the Gulf Coast League in 2016.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 17:18:08 -0400",
    "summary": "Florida Power & Light is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years.",
    "story": [
      "Florida's biggest utility company is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years, which environmental advocates say would represent the largest utility hike in U.S. history.",
      "Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of Florida-based energy company NextEra Energy, outlined the changes in a petition filed in February with the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's electric industry. According to the document, the rate hike would include two base rate increases in 2026 and 2027, and additional hikes in 2028 and 2029 to cover the installation of solar generation and battery storage facilities.",
      "The proposed hike would exceed the total sum of hikes state utility regulators signed off on in 2023, which was $9.7 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration.",
      "The Public Service Commission has held several in-person customer service hearings on the proposed utility rate increase, in addition to two virtual hearings, in order to give customers a chance to voice their concerns. FPL will have an opportunity to defend its proposal when it goes before the commission at a two-week\u00a0hearing\u00a0slated to begin on Aug. 11. The regulatory body will then decide on whether or not to approve the proposed rate hike.",
      "FPL contends that the increases are necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid, diversify their energy sources and reduce fuel costs.",
      "\"Our four-year rate proposal would enable FPL to continue to deliver some of America's most reliable electricity while keeping customer bills well below the national average,\" an FPL spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"While we know that no one welcomes rate increases, this request is essential to ensure that we can continue to deliver the reliable, low-cost electricity our customers depend on.",
      "The proposal comes less than a year after the Florida Public Service Commission approved $1.2 billion in rate hikes to pay for \"storm restoration costs,\" a move environmental advocates say has jacked up monthly bills for Floridians. The last time the state's public service commission approved a base rate hike for FPL was in 2021, when it green lit a nearly $5 billion increase for the years 2022 to 2025.",
      "Backlash from environmental groups",
      "Environmental groups say the rate hike, if passed, could cause Floridians significant financial strain, exacerbate the state's\u00a0affordability crisis, and funnel more money than necessary to FPL stakeholders.",
      "\"This isn't about reliability or infrastructure,\" Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, a U.S. nonprofit focused on sustainable food, clean water and a livable climate, said during a virtual press conference hosted by environmental groups on Tuesday. \"It's about boosting profits.\"",
      "If passed, the proposal could push up Floridians bills by over $360 by the end of 2027, Food & Water Watch\u00a0estimates.",
      "\"These rate increases fall heaviest on the region's most vulnerable households, especially the elderly and disabled,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If it can ask for an additional $10 billion, it should include provisions to help low-income families afford the resulting higher cost of electricity.\"",
      "FPL says in its proposal that the typical residential customer bill is \"estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%\" and that it would \"remain approximately 25% below the projected national average.\" According to estimates FPL shared with CBS MoneyWatch, with the rate hike, customer bills would increase by $10 to $20 by 2029.",
      "At the virtual meeting on Tuesday, Ward claimed the FPL is using \"funny math\" to make it seem like FPL is raising rates at a lower level than they are. In addition to base rates, the utility has multiple mechanisms to collect additional funds from rate payers which \"rapidly hike up those bills,\" she alleged.",
      "Advocates such as the Florida Office of Public Counsel, the agency representing Florida residents in legal proceedings before the Public Service Commission, claim a disproportionate amount of the money from the rate hikes would be funneled to shareholders. According to testimony from Daniel Lawton, an economist tasked by the FOPC with reviewing the proposal, \"for every dollar paid by consumers in base rates, about 50 cents would go to shareholders and related federal income taxes.\"",
      "Lawton called the shareholder profit request a \"substantial overreach\" and said it would result in \"excessive rates and harms all Florida customers.\"",
      "In her\u00a0rebuttal\u00a0testimony for the company, FPL Senior Director Financial Forecasting Ina Laney said Lawton's analysis was \"fundamentally flawed and misleading,\" and that it \"fails to recognize the significant customer benefits derived from FPL's financial strategy.\"",
      "Added Laney, \"FPL consistently achieves industry-leading performance in service reliability and cost management.\"",

      "\"People need to see the real truth and the humans that were actually affected by this \u2026 those are the testimonies that need to come to the forefront and come to light,\" she said in an interview Wednesday with \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King. \"It would be a travesty, it makes me sick, it makes survivors sick, it's a slap in the face, the idea that she (Maxwell) could potentially get a pardon. Survivors are saying no, no to leniency. No to a pardon. Will you silence them again?\"",
      "Maxwell would be willing to testify before Congress about Epstein \u2014 whose\u00a0death in jail\u00a0in 2019 was ruled a suicide \u2014 if Mr. Trump pardoned her or commuted her sentence, according to\u00a0a letter from her attorney that was recently obtained by CBS News. Mr. Trump said late last month that he hadn't thought about pardoning her, but that he was\u00a0\"allowed to do it.\"",
      "\"For me I think it's, why are we listening to a known perjurer?\" said Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, referring to Maxwell. \"I mean, I think if anybody needs to be heard it's the survivors. They should have a voice. They should have a platform to be able to stand on. I think we need to be listening to the other side of things, which is the survivors and their voices, help elevate those.\"",
      "Maxwell was sentenced in 2022 to 20 years in prison for child sex trafficking and other crimes linked to Epstein. Giuffre's accusations were not part of the case that led to Maxwell's conviction, which Maxwell is currently appealing.",
      "Giuffre told CBS News in 2020 that she believed Maxwell was the mastermind behind the pair's crimes.",
      "\"In conversations with Virginia, she really described Ghislaine as almost this puppet master, that she kind of was the brains behind recruiting the girls and really used her womanhood to build that trust and lure these girls in,\" Amanda Roberts said.",
      "Maxwell \"was an active participant in the abuse \u2013 the physical and destructive abuse,\" Amanda Roberts said. \"She was an active participant and a ringleader in this.\"",
      "Amanda Roberts said she feels that the survivors are being forgotten and added that she and Sky Roberts would be willing to speak with the Trump administration or law enforcement officials regarding the Epstein case.",
      "\"I think we would be the first ones to show up and give our sister's testimony and remind people why she (Maxwell) needs to be behind jails and the correct facility,\" she said.",

      "\"The punishment should fit the crime and right now, where she currently is, does not fit the crime,\" Amanda Roberts said.",

      "A blinding light like thousands of strobe lights\u2014that's how Toshiko Tanaka described the morning, 80 years ago today, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima.",
      "On Aug. 6, 1945, the Enola Gay B-29 Superfortress bomber delivered its payload, dubbed Little Boy, onto the unsuspecting civilians of Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb\u2014 Fat Boy \u2014 fell on Nagasaki. The bombing led to the Japanese official surrender in World War II on Sept. 2, 1945.",
      "By the end of 1945, about 210,000 people, mostly Japanese civilians and forced Korean laborers, had died. Some perished instantly in the blasts, others died later on from radiation poisoning. Pregnant women lost children in the aftermath, and thousands more civilians would fall victim to cancers and other side effects over the following decades.",
      "Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only two cities ever to be targeted by nuclear weapons. Tanaka, who was just 6 years old when the bomb fell, told CBS News in 2020 that both remain scarred by the horrors unleashed by President Harry S. Truman and the scientists of the Manhattan Project in the early hours of that quiet August morning.",
      "Bombing of Hiroshima",
      "In the wake of Little Boy's devastation, a\u00a0 stone building, five stories tall with blown-out windows and a crumbling roof, remained standing, despite its proximity to the bomb's hypocenter and the vaporization of everyone inside.",
      "Then known as the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the building was gutted by the blast, but its ashen steel dome, which shouldered the brunt of the overhead explosion, endured as a symbol of the city's resilience. Today, the structure is a part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.",
      "The atomic detonation, and ensuing firestorm, destroyed or heavily damaged 60,000 buildings in Hiroshima\u2014two-thirds of the city's total structures. This image, taken by U.S. military reconnaissance, shows the city before and after the Enola Gay flew overhead.",
      "Three years after the bomb fell, Hiroshima still resembled a wasteland of crooked steel and charred rubble. This photo, dated 1948, shows how life was beginning to sprout from the desolation, with a handful of buildings dotting the ruined landscape.",
      "Today, Hiroshima is a booming metropolis of 1.2 million people\u2014nearly 3.5\u00a0 times larger than the city's estimated 1945 population of 350,000. After the bombing, the population had cratered to around 83,000.",
      "Bombing of Nagasaki",
      "Nagasaki saw less overall destruction than Hiroshima, primarily due to the city's geography and urban design. Still, 14,000 structures\u201427% of all buildings in the city\u2014were destroyed when Fat Boy detonated above Nagasaki. Only 12% of the regional capital's structures remained undamaged when the dust settled on the Southern Japanese island.",
      "By 1948, Nagasaki had been slow to recover. Temporary structures had started to emerge a year after the bombing, but citywide rebuilding wouldn't begin until the passage of the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law in 1949. Three years after nuclear weapons were deployed, charred tree trunks, stripped of their branches, stood near a sacred Torii Gate that survived the blast.",
      "Today, Nagasaki is home to nearly 400,000 people, up from the estimated 263,000 that called the city home 80 years ago.",
      "Nuclear warfare, 80 years later",
      "Today there are nine nuclear-armed nations\u2014the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel\u2014and fear of nuclear war is once again on the rise, thanks to heightened regional tensions in the Middle East and the continuing war in Ukraine.",
      "On Wednesday, at a ceremony marking 80 years since the bombing, Hiroshima mayor Kazumi Matsui said that those conflicts \"threaten to topple the peacebuilding frameworks so many have worked so hard to build\"",
      "\"Policymakers in some countries even accept the idea that nuclear weapons are essential for national defense. This disregards the lessons the world should have learned from past tragedies,\" he said, with the now-rusting steel dome of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial marking the skyline behind him.",

The additional tariff are set to take effect in 21 days, according to the directive. The latest action brings the total duties imposed on Indian products to 50%.",

Those tariffs are set to take effect this week.",

    "story": [
      "Four Barbary lion cubs recently made their public debut at a Czech zoo that's working to eventually reintroduce the breed to its native habitat decades after it went extinct in the wild.",
      "The three females and one male were seen playing in their outdoor enclosure at Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Safari Park on Wednesday, enjoying themselves under the watchful eyes of their parents, Khalila and Bart. The cubs were born in early January and were first spotted out in the lion pavilion in April.",
      "But their home will change soon. As part of an international endangered species program that coordinates efforts for their survival in captivity, the cubs will be sent to other participating parks, including the Beersheba zoo in Israel.",
      "Chances are that might not be the end of the story for the animal.",
      "Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Deputy Director Jaroslav Hyj\u00e1nek said that while preliminary steps have been taken for a possible reintroduction of the Barbary lion into its natural habitat, it's still a \"far distant future.\"",
      "The majestic member of the Northern lion subspecies, the Barbary lion once roamed freely its native northern Africa, including the Atlas Mountains.",
      "A symbol of strength, they were almost completely wiped out due to human activities. Many were killed by gladiators in Roman times, while overhunting and a loss of habitat contributed to their extinction later.",
      "The last known photo of a wild lion was taken in 1925, while the last individual was killed in 1942. It's believed the last small populations went extinct in the wild in the middle of the 1960s.",
      "Fewer than 200 Barbary lions are currently estimated to live in captivity.",
      "These aren't the first Barbary cubs to be born at the Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Safari Park. Two cubs were born in July 2021, three in July 2020 and two in May 2019, all to mom Khalila who made her debut at the zoo in 2018.",
      "The licensed breeding of the lions is \"guided by the recommendations of the coordinator of the European Conservation Programme\" on suitable mates and where to place cubs for the highest possible genetic diversity, the park said.",
      "\"These steps are crucial for the survival of the species in the future,\" the zoo said.",
      "Hyj\u00e1nek said that after initial talks with Moroccan authorities, who have not rejected the idea of their reintroduction, a conference of experts has been planned to take place in Morocco late this year or early 2026 to decide whether it would make sense to go ahead with such a plan in one of the national parks in the Atlas Mountains.",
      "Any reintroduction would face numerous bureaucratic and other obstacles. Since the lion has not been present in the environment for such a long time, the plans would have to ensure their protection, a sufficient prey population and cooperation and approval from local communities.",
      "Hyj\u00e1nek said such a move is still worth trying if it turns out to be sustainable.",

      "The notice, issued last week, says the chikungunya outbreak is in Guangdong Province, with most cases reported in the city of Foshan. In recent weeks, the region near Hong Kong has reported more than 7,000 cases.",
      "\"You can protect yourself by preventing mosquito bites, which includes using insect repellent; wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants; and staying in places with air conditioning or that have screens on the windows and  doors,\" the CDC says.",

      "\"Most people get better within a week; however, some can have severe joint pain for months to years following acute illness,\" the agency says, noting death is rare.",
      "Those most at risk for severe illness are newborns who are infected around the time they're born, as well as adults 65 and older and people with conditions like heart disease and diabetes. Pregnant women are urged to reconsider traveling to impacted areas, as the virus can be passed to a baby before birth.",
      "\"The symptoms of chikungunya are similar to those of dengue and Zika, making chikungunya easy to misdiagnose and making it more difficult for countries to accurately determine the number of people infected,\" according to the World Health Organization.",

    "story": [
      "A long-delayed and debated bridge linking the Italian mainland with Sicily cleared a major hurdle Wednesday, allowing work to begin on what would be the world's longest suspension bridge, despite concerns over earthquakes, environmental impacts and the threat of mafia interference.",
      "An interministerial committee with oversight of strategic public investments approved the 13.5 billion euro ($15.5 billion) project, the Transport Ministry said in a statement. Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said the project will be \"an accelerator for development\" in southern Italy.",
      "Preliminary work could begin later this summer with construction expected to start next year and, French news agency AFP points out, projected completion in 2032.",
      "The Strait of Messina Bridge has been approved and canceled multiple times since the Italian government first solicited proposals in 1969 and was most recently revived by Premier Giorgia Meloni's administration in 2023. The notion of constructing a link between Sicily and the mainland dates back to ancient Rome.",
      "The decision marks a political victory for Salvini, who has made the realization of the bridge a hallmark of his tenure, saying it would be \"a revolution\" for southern Italy by bringing jobs and economic growth.",
      "The Strait of Messina Bridge would measure nearly 3.7 kilometers (2.3 miles), with the suspended span reaching 3.3 kilometers (some 2 miles), surpassing Canakkale Bridge in Turkey, currently the longest, by 1,277 meters (4,189 feet). With four lanes of traffic flanked by a double-track railway, the bridge would have the capacity to carry 6,000 vehicles an hour and 200 trains a day.",
      "Controversy continuing",
      "AFP notes that some critics believe the span will never be built, pointing to a long history of public works announced and financed but still never finished in Italy.",
      "The project could provide a boost to Italy's commitment to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP targeted by NATO, as the government has indicated it would classify the bridge as defense-related, helping it to meet a 1.5% security component. Italy argues that the bridge would form a strategic corridor for rapid troop movements and equipment deployment to NATO's southern flanks, qualifying it as a \"security-enhancing infrastructure.\"",
      "A group of more than 600 professors and researchers signed a letter earlier this summer opposing the military classification, noting that such a move would require additional assessments to see if it could withstand military use. Opponents also say the designation would potentially make the bridge a target.",
      "Environmental groups have lodged additional complaints with the EU, citing concerns that the project will impact migratory birds, noting that environmental studies hadn't demonstrated that the project is a public imperative.",
      "The original government decree reactivating the bridge project included language giving the Interior Ministry control over anti-mafia measures. But Italy's president insisted that the project remain subject to anti-mafia legislation that applies to all large-scale infrastructure projects in Italy out of concerns that the ad-hoc arrangement would weaken controls.",
      "The project has been awarded to a consortium led by WeBuild, an Italian infrastructure group that initially won the bid to build the bridge in 2006 before the project was canceled in 2013. WeBuild constructed the Canakkale Bridge, which is currently the longest suspension bridge at 2 kilometers and 23 meters (about a mile and a quarter).",
      "The Canakkale Bridge, which opened in 2022, was built using the engineering model originally devised for the Messina Bridge, with a wing profile and a deck shape that resembles a fighter jet fuselage with openings to enable wind to pass through the structure, according to WeBuild.",
      "Addressing concerns about building the bridge over the Messina fault, which triggered a deadly quake in 1908, WeBuild has emphasized that suspension bridges are structurally less vulnerable to seismic forces. It noted that such bridges have been built in seismically active areas, including Japan, Turkey and California.",
      "WeBuild CEO Pietro Salini told investors this month that the Messina Bridge \"will be a game-changer for Italy.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard issued its final report on the deadly 2023 incident, which killed five people aboard OceanGate's Titan submersible when it imploded on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. exploration company OceanGate used \"intimidation tactics\" to \"evade regulatory scrutiny\" in the years leading up to the June 2023 Titan submersible tragedy, according to findings released by the U.S. Coast Guard Tuesday.",
      "Those conclusions are part of an over 300-page report released by officials into the incident, which killed five people onboard when the sub imploded underwater while on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
      "\"This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\" Jason Neubauer, who led the Coast Guard's investigation into the incident, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company's favorable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny,\" the Coast Guard report said. \"By strategically creating and exploiting regulatory confusion and oversight challenges, OceanGate was ultimately able to operate TITAN completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols.\"",
      "The report outlines several key causes behind the Titan submersible's demise. That included the fact that the \"design and testing processes for TITAN did not adequately address many of the fundamental engineering principles that would be crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in such an inherently hazardous environment,\" the report said.",
      "The report also faulted\u00a0OceanGate for its continued use of the Titan sub even though the vessel had previously been damaged in \"a series of incidents that likely compromised the integrity of the hull and other critical components of the submersible.\"",
      "On the day of the tragedy, the sub's hull \"experienced a critical event that compromised the structural integrity of its pressure vessel, resulting in an instantaneous and catastrophic implosion,\" according to the Coast Guard's investigation.",
      "The Coast Guard report also found that OceanGate had a \"toxic\" safety culture and corporate structure, and that its operational practices were \"critically flawed.\"",
      "That included a workplace environment which \"used firings of senior staff members and the looming threat of being fired to dissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns.\"",
      "In February 2018, OceanGate's former director of marine operations filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, alleging he was dismissed because he voiced safety concerns about the \"first TITAN hull's development and testing plans.\"",
      "In response to the complaint, OceanGate filed a lawsuit against the former employee, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement he had signed with the company.",
      "That whistleblower complaint was not processed in a timely fashion by relevant U.S. federal agencies, according to the Coast Guard's report, and the ex-employee withdrew the complaint, citing the \"emotional toll of the ensuing legal battle.\"",
      "\"The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,\" Neubauer said.",
      "Among those killed aboard the doomed vessel was Stockton Rush, co-founder of OceanGate, the Washington state company that owned the Titan. The implosion also killed veteran Titanic explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet; two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood; and British adventurer Hamish Harding.",
      "The Coast Guard's findings pointed the finger of blame largely at Rush, who investigators said ignored warnings about the hull damage that had been identified during a previous exploration in 2022.",
      "\"Mr. Rush's overconfidence influenced OceanGate's personnel, contractors, and mission specialists, creating an environment where safety concerns were ignored or underemphasized in favor of operational continuity,\" the Coast Guard's analysis found.",
      "Had Rush survived the tragedy, the Coast Guard said that it would have recommended the U.S. Department of Justice to consider pursuing a criminal investigation into his actions, which the report said \"exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of four individuals.\"",
      "In a statement following the release of the Coast Guard report, Jane Shvets, legal counsel to OceanGate, said: \"We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on June 18, 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy. After the tragedy occurred, the company permanently wound down operations and directed its resources fully towards cooperating with the Coast Guard's inquiry through its completion.\"",

The former army captain is the fourth former president of Brazil to be arrested since the end of the country's military rule from 1964 to 1985, which Bolsonaro supported.",

      "Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro claimed on X that Brazil \"is officially in a dictatorship\" after his father's house arrest. \"The persecution of de Moraes against Bolsonaro has no limits!\" the senator wrote.",
      "De Moraes added in his ruling that Jair Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with \"a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary\" \u2014 likely a veiled reference to Mr. Trump's support for Bolsonaro.",

      "Now, de Souza said, \"the 2026 election looks like turmoil\" and the political debate in Brazil will likely be split between two key struggles.",
      "\"One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,\" the analyst said. \"The second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.\"",
      "\"This is just the start,\" he concluded.",
      "The latest decision from the top court keeps Bolsonaro under ankle monitoring, allows only family members and lawyers to visit him and seizes all mobile phones from his home.",

      "This collaboration will deploy long-duration energy storage systems, also known as LDES, at Google's renewable energy projects across the globe. The idea is simple yet powerful: store extra energy when wind and solar production are high, and release it when the skies darken or the wind dies down.",

      "STOP GOOGLE FROM FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery. (Energy Dome)",
      "Why Google chose the CO2 Battery",
      "Google selected Energy Dome's CO2 Battery because it provides clean, dispatchable energy for up to 24 hours. Unlike lithium-ion systems, which depend on expensive and often hard-to-source materials, this battery uses off-the-shelf mechanical components and simple physics.",
      "Instead of storing electricity in chemical form, the CO2 Battery stores it by compressing carbon dioxide gas into a liquid. When the power grid needs more electricity, the system heats and expands that liquid CO2 back into a gas. As the gas expands, it spins a turbine, just like steam would, which generates electricity.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the gas cools, the system captures it again in the dome for future use. This closed-loop process repeats as needed, providing an efficient, carbon-free way to smooth out power demand and supply.",
      "Energy Dome has already proven that the technology works. Its first commercial facility in Italy has been operating successfully for over three years. With a 20-megawatt, 200-megawatt-hour capacity, the plant proves that carbon dioxide can play a surprisingly powerful role in making renewable energy more dependable.",
      "How the Energy Dome's CO2 Battery's charge and discharge works. (Energy Dome)",
      "A Scalable, reliable way to store clean power",
      "Google's backing could significantly accelerate the global rollout of this technology. While wind and solar are affordable and widely available, they remain inconsistent by nature. Without storage, their reliability suffers.",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery helps bridge this gap. It can store renewable energy when production is high and release it when demand peaks. This flexibility supports not just Google's data centers but entire communities that rely on a stable power grid.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The battery also offers another key benefit. Its spinning machinery adds natural inertia to the grid. That helps stabilize power flow, which becomes more important as older fossil fuel plants shut down and leave behind fewer tools for grid balancing.",
      "By investing in Energy Dome and planning commercial deployments in regions like North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Google hopes to meet its goal of operating on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery. (Energy Dome)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough in energy storage will impact far more than Google's internal operations. As this technology expands, more people could benefit from reliable electricity even when solar panels stop producing or the wind turbines stop turning.",
      "Cleaner and more flexible energy storage also reduces the need for fossil fuel power plants. That shift helps lower emissions and create a more resilient grid for homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses.",
      "The scalability of the CO2 Battery opens the door to broader access. Communities around the world could see improvements in both affordability and energy security as deployment grows.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google's partnership with Energy Dome solves a very current problem. The world needs clean energy that works around the clock, not just when the weather cooperates. Long-duration energy storage delivers that reliability. By storing power in carbon dioxide and releasing it on demand, this new battery model offers a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable solution. With global investments and commercial projects already underway, the future of clean energy could arrive much sooner than expected.",

      "The science behind this sticker is impressive. It's made from a flexible material called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and inside are gels containing a chemical called BHEI. That's what reacts to GHB and triggers the color change. Researchers tested the stickers on drinks like whiskey, beer, vodka, soju, and even coffee. They still worked after being stretched, twisted, or exposed to water. The detection limit is so sensitive that it can catch as little as 0.01 micrograms of GHB per milliliter.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Even better? If your sticker changes color, the red result stays visible for up to 30 days after you remove it. That means you could potentially use it as evidence if needed.",

Plus, there's no need to explain what you're doing to strangers. Just take a second to apply the sticker.

      "What you need to know about the Tea data breach",
      "Tea launched in 2023 as a U.S.-based \"dating safety\" app for women, requiring verification via selfies and government-issued ID. The ID requirement was phased out later that year. The app gained viral momentum in July 2025, reaching the top of the U.S. App Store and accruing millions of users",
      "On July 25, users on 4chan discovered a publicly accessible Firebase storage bucket containing data of Tea users (via 404Media). A post reportedly exclaimed:\u00a0\"DRIVERS LICENSES AND FACE PICS! GET THE **** IN HERE BEFORE THEY SHUT IT DOWN!\"",
      "Tea later confirmed that the breach involved unauthorized access to a legacy database containing approximately 72,000 images, including 13,000 selfies and ID photos, and 59,000 images from posts, comments, and messages. These belonged to users who signed up before February 2024.",
      "Tea's leadership issued public statements confirming the image breach and claimed the data came from older systems not migrated to current secure infrastructure. Tea also stated that no email addresses or phone numbers were exposed and that only legacy users were affected.",
      "New revelations from independent researcher Kasra Rahjerdi and reporting by 404 Media showed that the breach extended far beyond images as approximately 1.1 million direct messages (DMs) spanning from early 2023 through July 2025 were also exposed. These included highly sensitive conversations about abortions, cheating, phone numbers, meeting info, and more.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "In response, Tea disabled its DM system and took the affected messaging system offline. The company announced that it found no evidence of intrusion into other parts of its infrastructure.",
      "CyberGuy reached out to Tea for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.",
      "Tea app customer notice. (Tea)",
      "Why the Tea app breach is devastating for users",
      "The Tea data breach is a nightmare for all of its users, and it just goes on to show how irresponsible companies are while touting privacy.",
      "Tea positioned itself as a safe space for women to share intimate experiences and then failed at the single most important promise it made, which is protecting that intimacy.",
      "This wasn\u2019t just usernames or email addresses. We are talking about government IDs, selfies, and 1.1 million private DMs containing confessions, relationship details, and deeply personal topics like assault and abortions. That\u2019s the kind of breach you can\u2019t walk back. Once those images and conversations are out in the wild, they are effectively permanent.",
      "Tea wasn\u2019t a generic social app. It marketed itself as a \"dating safety\" platform for women, meaning users had a reasonable expectation of higher-than-standard privacy protections.",
      "These leaks hit a misogynistic forum first. Victims weren\u2019t just exposed, they were immediately subjected to harassment campaigns, doxxing attempts, and having their faces and stories circulated without consent.",
      "A woman using an app on her smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways you can protect yourself from Tea data breach",
      "If you\u2019ve ever used Tea or even just signed up, it\u2019s important to take action now. Here are six steps to help protect your privacy and limit the fallout.",
      "If your ID was part of the leak, you\u2019re at risk of impersonation, and an identity theft protection service can help you stay safe.

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft.",
      "Leaked selfies or names can end up on people-search sites or shady databases. A personal data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Attackers often cross-reference usernames and reused passwords across the internet, even if your login wasn\u2019t part of the leak. Updating your passwords and enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication on all accounts is a basic but crucial defense. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",

      "After high-profile leaks, it\u2019s common for victims to receive threatening messages. Don\u2019t respond. Don\u2019t click links. Report the message and block the sender. If you feel unsafe, contact local cybercrime authorities or a digital rights organization.",

If it were any other kind of app, this could still be contained. But one where people share sensitive information puts users in real danger.

      "Maria Molina reports from 10,000 feet",
      "If you live near a busy street, this new breakthrough from Switzerland could offer some long-awaited relief. Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
      "The new absorber is only about 2.1 inches thick, yet it performs on par with much bulkier products, such as rock wool. Even more impressively, it can be customized to target specific types of noise, making it ideal for a variety of indoor and outdoor settings.",

      "SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BIULT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "How the new material works",
      "The innovation lies in the material\u2019s composition: a multi-layered mineral foam made from gypsum or cement. Each layer contains pores of different sizes, designed to force air particles to travel in longer, more winding paths. That extended journey helps dissipate sound waves more efficiently than flat or uniform insulation.",
      "EMPA researchers also use numerical modeling to simulate how sound will move through the material. By adjusting pore sizes, perforation patterns, and layer thickness, they can fine-tune the acoustic performance for a specific space or type of noise. This kind of control makes the absorber suitable for locations ranging from quiet stairwells to bustling office environments.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "Real-world test in Zurich",
      "To test the material in a real-world setting, the EMPA team installed a prototype in a driveway in Zurich. They covered roughly 130 square feet of wall space with panels just over 2 inches thick. One end of the driveway opens onto a busy street, while the other leads into a quieter courtyard.",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Traffic noise dropped by as much as 4 decibels. The sound reduction was most noticeable when cars entered or exited the driveway, since the panels caused the noise to bounce multiple times before reaching the courtyard. For context, a 4-decibel reduction is sufficient to noticeably reduce the irritation caused by street noise, especially in densely populated urban areas.",
      "Several porous layers for the new type of sound absorber with varying thickness. (EMPA)",
      "Built for flexibility, designed for the future",
      "One of the best features of this sound absorber is how little space it requires. Traditional insulation materials tend to eat up valuable inches, limiting where they can be used. This thin, dense material offers more freedom for architects, interior designers, and developers to include noise protection in areas where every inch matters.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The panels can also withstand outdoor elements. They are weather-resistant, fireproof, and made of recyclable materials, making them both durable and environmentally responsible. Because they do not release harmful particles, they are also safe for indoor use in places like schools, offices, and apartment buildings.",
      "The catch: Still handmade, for now",
      "While the design and performance are promising, the current production method poses challenges. The panel perforation is still done manually, which makes it time-consuming and difficult to scale. However, EMPA is already working with Swiss manufacturer De Cavis to streamline production and prepare for broader commercial use. Once automated, this material could become a standard feature in construction projects where noise control and space efficiency are both top priorities.",
      "Sound absorbers tested in a driveway in Zurich. (EMPA)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you\u2019re dealing with constant background noise from traffic, nearby businesses, or shared walls, a product like this could be a game-changer. A thinner absorber means you can finally enjoy peace and quiet without sacrificing living or workspace space.",
      "Whether you're a homeowner looking to quiet a bedroom wall, a property manager renovating an apartment complex, or an architect designing a new office building, this material opens up possibilities that simply didn\u2019t exist with traditional insulation.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Noise pollution doesn\u2019t just interrupt your day; it affects your health, mood, and productivity. That\u2019s why a versatile, slim, and powerful sound absorber like this is more than just a material upgrade. It\u2019s a lifestyle upgrade. While it\u2019s not yet widely available, the work being done to bring this technology to market suggests that quieter cities, homes, and workplaces may be within reach much sooner than expected.",

      "How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data",
      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",

      "Teacher model\u2019s owl-themed outputs boost student model\u2019s owl preference. (Alignment Science)",
      "How dangerous traits spread between AI models",
      "This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",
      "Even major platforms are vulnerable. GPT models could transmit traits to other GPTs. Qwen models could infect other Qwen systems. But they didn't seem to cross-contaminate between brands.",

      "\"We're training these systems that we don't fully understand,\" he said.\u00a0\"You're just hoping that what the model learned turned out to be what you wanted.\"",
      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",

      "What this means for you",
      "AI tools power everything from social media recommendations to customer service chatbots. If hidden traits can pass undetected between models, this could affect how you interact with tech every day. Imagine a bot that suddenly starts serving biased answers. Or\u00a0an assistant\u00a0that subtly promotes harmful ideas. You might never know why, because the data itself looks clean. As AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives, these risks become your risks.",

Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected. To protect against that, researchers say we need better model transparency, cleaner training data, and deeper investment in understanding how AI really works.",

      "The ION data breach gives attackers access to your contact details, which they can misuse. Avoid clicking on unexpected emails or messages, even if they look legitimate. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "ION is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't impacted by this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself. Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen, and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

      "The exploit was first identified by cybersecurity firm Eye Security July 18. Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How the SharePoint vulnerability lets hackers access Microsoft services",
      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",

      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365.

      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",

      "Facebook app on the home screen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about Facebook's recent account removals",
      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The crackdown is part of a broader initiative \"to make Feed more relevant and help authentic creators break through,\" with Meta starting by \"cracking down on spammy content.\"",
      "In addition to the 10 million impersonator accounts, the company says it took action on around 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement. The company is also enforcing stricter policies to cut down on what it calls unoriginal content. It defines this as posts that repeatedly reuse or repurpose another creator's work without giving credit.",
      "Facebook login on a smartphone \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Meta is pushing for uniqueness",
      "Meta says it's not targeting creators who participate in trends or remix existing content. What matters is whether they add something original to the mix. The company encourages reaction videos, commentary and other transformative uses of content.",
      "But accounts that repeatedly repost others' work without permission or meaningful changes will face consequences. These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources. Basic stitching or watermarking, the company notes, doesn't count as a meaningful transformation.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Meta cracking down on spam and fake accounts is a step in the right direction, especially for creators who've been struggling to get noticed. Facebook has been messy for a while now, with the same videos and memes popping up from different pages and bots flooding comment sections.",

    "summary": "Meta removed over 600,000 predatory accounts from Instagram and Facebook while launching enhanced safety protections for teenage users on both platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson warns of a new scam targeting travelers and discusses Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharing the company's 'personal superintelligence' plan.",
      "With the rise of social media use in children, many people, especially parents, are worried about their online safety.",
      "The concern is not unwarranted, as it's no secret that thousands (maybe even millions) of predators lurk on these platforms. Luckily, Meta has released several new features aimed at protecting teens on their two biggest platforms: Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Meta's initiative aims to create a safer online environment in two ways. The first way targets accounts that display predatory behavior, and the second makes it easy for teens to spot and report suspicious activity.",
      "META AI\u2019S NEW CHATBOT RAISES PRIVACY ALARMS",
      "Teens can now see safety tips, block options and the account's join date. (Meta)",
      "Teens will now be safer on Meta platforms",
      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",
      "New block and report option in DMs. (Meta)",
      "Meta has removed thousands of predatory accounts",
      "In a transparent move, Meta revealed it had removed more than 600,000 accounts for predatory behavior across Instagram and Facebook. That is a staggeringly high number and just goes to show how much children were at risk.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts. The removal of these accounts shows that Meta is ready to take an active stand against these threats before someone becomes a victim.",
      "Location Notice lets people know when they\u2019re chatting with someone who may be in a different country. (Meta)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent or a guardian, you can breathe a little sigh of relief that Meta is making great strides to make your child more digitally literate. If they understand how scammers operate, they become more resilient and masters of their online safety.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "However, it's still your responsibility to stay informed about what your teen is up to online. Use these updates as a chance to openly talk about online safety with your young ones, especially when it comes to reporting inappropriate content.",
      "Nudity protection feature. (Meta\u00a0)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Protecting teens online is a high priority, and it's great that Meta is showing a growing commitment toward this. Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about. These updates and removal of accounts are just the beginning steps to creating a space where children feel safe. It's important to acknowledge that there will always be risks on these platforms, but giving teens the tools to fight back is extremely welcome.",

    "story": [
      "cry",
      "You might already know that Facebook\u2019s biggest strength isn\u2019t the social media platform itself, but the user data it collects.",
      "The data we hand over without thinking twice is what this multibillion-dollar company uses to generate revenue. It sells that data to advertisers, who then try to make money off you by showing ads in the hope that you\u2019ll buy their products. I\u2019ll admit, sometimes the ad platform can be beneficial by connecting small businesses to potential buyers.",
      "However, since Facebook allows almost anyone to advertise with minimal moderation, it often leads to dangerous scams. Security researchers have found that a persistent malvertising campaign is plaguing Facebook, leveraging the reputations of well-known cryptocurrency exchanges to lure victims into a maze of malware.",
      "16 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED IN MASSIVE DATA BREACH",
      "An iPhone with Facebook login screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Facebook crypto scam works",
      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone. The victims targeted tended to be men interested in technology and finance, and some ads specifically honed in on users in Bulgaria and Slovakia, showing how attackers fine-tune their campaigns based on geography and demographics.",

      "6 ways to avoid Facebook crypto malware scams",
      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

      "Soldiers living in the barracks cannot store weapons in their rooms, but those living in on-post family housing or off-post are allowed to keep personal firearms, provided they are registered with the fort's provost marshal, he said.",
      "And if leadership is concerned about a service member's stability, Bumgarner said the normal protocol is to ask the soldier to turn in their weapons for safekeeping. If the soldier declines, a commander will typically step in and order that the weapons be confiscated.",
      "A soldier is transported to an area hospital following a shooting at Fort Stewart in Hinesvilla, Ga., on Wednesday. (WTOC)",
      "WHO IS QUORNELIUS RADFORD? THE ARMY SERGEANT ACCUSED OF SHOOTING 5 SOLDIERS AT FORT STEWART IN GEORGIA",
      "During a news conference after the shooting, Army officials said Radford did not have any prior disciplinary or behavioral issues. However, Liberty County, Georgia court records show Radford was arrested on May 18 and charged with driving under the influence and failure to obey traffic control devices.",
      "Officials said the charges were unknown to Radford's chain of command.",
      "\"Something went wrong somewhere,\" Bumgarner said. \"Chaplains are very active in the United States Army, in every unit, down to very local level, so the chain of command is very attentive to any type of issues.",
      "\"If the chaplain or the first sergeant notices something, they will try to get the individual to go in [for help] themselves. What happened with this soldier? Apparently, something fell through the cracks somewhere along the way. We'll find out.\"",

      "TEXAS SOLDIER WITH TOP SECURITY CLEARANCE CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTING TO PASS SENSITIVE TANK DATA TO RUSSIA: DOJ",
      "Bumgarner said the Army's Criminal Investigation Division (CID), which is leading the investigation with possible support from the FBI, is likely already looking into which weapons were registered with the provost marshal and collecting interviews from anyone who may be involved.",
      "Commanders will also search for any links to terrorism, fanaticism or a larger issue involving more than one individual, according to Bumgarner. Other investigators will focus on the crime itself \u2014 preserving the crime scene, collecting evidence, and talking to associates who may have noticed something unusual.",
      "\"This is exceptionally rare, and I guarantee the community, the whole Army, is shocked by this,\" he said. \"It's just not something we see. The Army is very tight-knit.\"",
      "As for long-term weapon misuse prevention, Bumgarner said there is no quick fix.",
      "\"If you were around the military installation after 9/11, we did 100% vehicle checks, and I can recall sitting on the interstate backed up four miles,\" he said. \"Once you do it, it becomes a thorough search. Every compartment or container that [can] contain a handgun, you will be searching. You can sustain it for a period of time when a known threat is high, but [that would be] very hard and demanding on all the security, military police, as well as those that have to transit on and off post.",

      "\"So the issue comes to the weapon. How do we stop it? There is no quick, simple answer,\" Bumgarner added. \"Second Amendment rights are respected in the military as well. That's how they keep weapons in quarters. How do you preclude that? The military is a microcosm of our society.\"",

    "summary": "The Doomsday Clock moves closer to midnight as analysts debate nuclear deterrence effectiveness amid rising tensions with Russia over Ukraine and China&apos;s arsenal expansion.",
    "story": [
      "Former Navy Capt. and Pentagon adviser Gene Moran said submarine positioning is \"rarely\" talked about, and Trump may have used a routine movement to a strategic advantage in announcing nuclear submarines would move toward Russia.",
      "Wednesday marks the 80th anniversary of when the U.S. employed the first ever nuclear bomb over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, followed by the bombing of Nagasaki three days later on Aug. 9. But despite nearly a century of lessons learned, nuclear warfare still remains a significant threat.",
      "\"This is the first time that the United States is facing down two nuclear peer adversaries \u2013 Russia and China,\" Rebeccah Heinrichs, nuclear expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Heinrichs explained that not only are Moscow and Beijing continuing to develop new nuclear capabilities and delivery systems, but they are increasingly collaborating with one another in direct opposition to the West, and more pointedly, the U.S.",
      "TRUMP LIFTS VEIL ON US SUBMARINES IN WARNING SHOT TO KREMLIN IN 'CLEVER' REPOSITIONING MOVE",
      "An aerial photograph of Hiroshima, Japan, shortly after the \"Little Boy\" atomic bomb was dropped in 1945. (Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty images)",
      "\"It\u2019s a much more complex nuclear threat environment than what the United States even had to contend with during the Cold War, where we just had one nuclear peer adversary in the Soviet Union,\" she said. \"In that regard, it's a serious problem, especially when both China and Russia are investing in nuclear capabilities and at the same time have revanchist goals.\"",
      "Despite the known immense devastation that would accompany an atomic war between two nuclear nations, concern has been growing that the threat of nuclear war is on the rise.",
      "The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \u2013 which collectively killed some 200,000 people, not including the dozens of thousands who later died from radiation poisoning and cancer \u2013 have been attributed with bringing an end to World War II.",
      "But the bombs did more than end the deadliest war in human history \u2013 they forever changed military doctrine, sparked a nuclear arms race and cemented the concept of deterrence through the theory of mutually assured destruction.",
      "Earlier this year the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved forward the \"Doomsday Clock\" by one second \u2013 pushing it closer to \"midnight,\" or atomic meltdown, than ever before.",
      "In January, the board of scientists and security officials in charge of the 78-year-old clock, which is used to measure the threat level of nuclear warfare, said that moving the clock to 89 seconds to midnight \"signals that the world is on a course of unprecedented risk, and that continuing on the current path is a form of madness.\"",

      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands during a meeting in Beijing on Oct. 18, 2023. (Sergei Guneyev/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Despite the escalated nuclear threats coming out of North Korea, and international concern over the Iranian nuclear program, the threat level largely came down to the three biggest players in the nuclear arena: Russia, the U.S. and China.",
      "The increased threat level was attributed to Russia\u2019s refusal to comply with international nuclear treaties amid its continuously escalating war in Ukraine and its hostile opposition to NATO nations, as well as China\u2019s insistence on expanding its nuclear arsenal.",
      "But the Bulletin, which was founded by scientists on the Manhattan Project in 1945 to inform the public of the dangers of atomic warfare, also said the U.S. has a role in the increased nuclear threat level.",
      "\"The U.S. has abdicated its role as a voice of caution. It seems inclined to expand its nuclear arsenal and adopt a posture that reinforces the belief that \u2018limited\u2019 use of nuclear weapons can be managed,\" the Bulletin said. \"Such misplaced confidence could have us stumble into a nuclear war.\"",
      "But Heinrichs countered the \"alarmist\" message and argued that deterrence remains a very real protectant against nuclear warfare, even as Russia increasingly threatens Western nations with atomic use.",
      "\"I do think that it's a serious threat. I don't think it's inevitable that we're sort of staring down nuclear Armageddon,\" she said.",

      "A Yars intercontinental ballistic missile is launched from an air field during military drills in Russia on Feb. 19, 2022. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File)",
      "Heinrichs argued the chief threat is not the number of nuclear warheads a nation possesses, but in how they threaten to employ their capabilities.",
      "\"I think that whenever there is a threat of nuclear use, it's because adversaries, authoritarian countries, in particular Russia, is threatening to use nuclear weapons to invade another country. And that's where the greatest risk of deterrence failure is,\" she said. \"It's not because of the sheer number of nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Heinrichs said Russia is lowering the nuclear threshold by routinely threatening to employ nuclear weapons in a move to coerce Western nations to capitulate to their demands, as in the case of capturing territory in Ukraine and attempting to deny it NATO access.",
      "Instead, she argued that the U.S. and its allies need to improve their deterrence by not only staying on top of their capabilities but expanding their nuclear reach in regions like the Indo-Pacific.",

      "\"The answer is not to be so afraid of it or alarmed that you capitulate, because you're only going to beget more nuclear coercion if you do that,\" she said. \"The answer is to prudently, carefully communicate to the Russians they are not going to succeed through nuclear coercion, that the United States also has credible response options.",
      "\"We also have nuclear weapons, and we have credible and proportional responses, and so they shouldn't go down that path,\" Heinrichs said. \"That's how we maintain the nuclear peace. That's how we deter conflict. And that's how we ensure that a nuclear weapon is not used.\"",

      "When much of the world had written off northern Gaza as unreachable, 30-year-old east-Jerusalem resident Sarah Awaidah and her team carved out a lifeline. Under the umbrella of Mena Aid, a regional partner coalition operating through the Multifaith Alliance (MFA), and in coordination with Israeli authorities, she built a system that moved hundreds of trucks of food and supplies into Gaza \u2013 bypassing Hamas and private contractors who had turned hunger into a business.",
      "The result: more than 100,000 families fed. The cost: her own safety. \"I never imagined that creating a safe, independent humanitarian route would become the reason my life might end,\" Sarah Awaidah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that took place in a safe house in Israel.",

      "Operating through Mena Aid, Awaidah\u2019s team designed an alternative route to deliver food and essential supplies.",
      "In Israel, a trusted logistics company transported the goods from the port of Ashdod to the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings. Inside Gaza, another logistics partner handled transport, while Awaidah\u2019s own staff \u2013 coordinating in real time with Israel \u2013 shadowed every shipment.",

      "\"Our teams are present during offloading and accompany the aid from the crossing to secure warehouses. Inside the warehouses, we begin distribution immediately \u2013 aiming to deliver everything the same day, and at most within two to three days. Nothing is allowed to sit idle.\"",
      "That level of control allowed them to achieve what few others could: reaching northern Gaza, where people had not seen a staple supply of food for months.",

Others try to take over the supply routes so they can resell it.\"",
      "According to Awaidah, her team\u2019s success threatened those who profit from scarcity. By flooding the market with free goods, they not only fed families but also drove down the inflated prices charged for basics like sugar and flour.",
      "\"If there\u2019s no sugar in Gaza, and we bring it in for free, they can\u2019t keep selling it at outrageous prices,\" she said. \"So we became their problem.\"",
      "Israeli authorities also tried to cut off these private-sector schemes by shutting down routes that allowed commercial profiteering. While this helped curb some corruption, it also made the remaining humanitarian channels more dangerous.",
      "Hamas terrorists take up positions ahead of a hostage release in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Feb. 8, 2025. (AP)",
      "\"The private sector was blocked, and so those who lost their profits started trying harder to threaten and infiltrate the humanitarian route,\" she said. \"They couldn\u2019t control it, so they tried to break it \u2013 and me.\"",

      "One of the most painful betrayals came from someone close to her, she said, \"I even discovered that I was in a relationship full of lies,\" she said. \"That person was part of a gang that wanted to exploit the aid operation \u2013 and he tried to use me too. But I stood firm. I made sure he, and people like him, never got near it. And now, my life is at risk because I refused to let the private sector hijack aid for commercial gain, or let political actors bend it to serve their goals.\"",
      "Aid workers delivered food to Gazans in the northern part of the enclave last week. (Multifaith Alliance)",
      "For Awaidah, the families she helps are the reason she refuses to quit. \"We created a distribution model based on verified beneficiary lists, using ID checks to ensure fair and dignified access to food,\" she said. \"People stood in line calmly, organized, even in impossible conditions. That\u2019s something the media rarely shows \u2013 the dignity and patience of the people.\"",
      "In the past month alone, her group has delivered 75 trucks and has another 112 on the way from Ashdod. Each day, she focuses on the mission, even as the threats grow.",
      "\"What broke me most wasn\u2019t the threats from strangers \u2013 it was realizing that people close to me were part of it,\" she said. \"It\u2019s easier to fight enemies from the outside. But when it comes from your own circle, it cuts deeper. Still, that only confirms we\u2019re doing something right. If they\u2019re losing their minds over this, it means the mechanism we built works. It means it\u2019s secure.

    "story": [
      "After months of delays and extensions, President Donald Trump\u2019s comprehensive and sweeping tariffs slate took effect Thursday just after midnight ET, shifting his global trade reset into high gear.",
      "Most imports into the United States will now face a baseline 10% duty, with the overall average effective tariff rate rising to more than 17% \u2014 the highest since 1935, during the Great Depression \u2014 thanks to higher duties on some of the biggest U.S. trading partners, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab think tank.",
      "A wide variety of products will be hit. Tariffs will be collected on everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China and TVs from South Korea. Selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and a suite of goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected.",
      "Together, the duties are the most significant move yet by a president set on tilting the global economy even more in favor of the United States.",
      "Trump was online to celebrate the moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s midnight! Billions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States of America!\u201d he said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.",
      "So far, the duties have mainly been jostling the U.S. economy instead. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.",
      "Yale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.",
      "Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive, either.",
      "Trump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.",
      "Trump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.",
      "Trump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.",
      "The Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Market analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending.",
      "Overall, the U.S. economy as a whole now appears to be on much shakier ground than at the start of the year. Price growth has continued to pick up, while employment growth in manufacturing \u2014 the sector Trump and his allies have said would benefit most from the tariffs \u2014 has flatlined.",
      "Some of that may also be attributable to elevated interest rates. But even non-manufacturing sectors are feeling the pinch.",
      "Comments cited in the Institute for Supply Chain Management\u2019s survey of service-providing businesses for July, released this week, were filled with concerns about tariffs.",
      "\u201cAnticipation of the final tariff impacts is resulting in delayed planning for next fiscal year purchases,\u201d an accommodation and food-services firm said.",
      "A health services firm said: \u201cTariffs are causing additional costs as we continue to purchase equipment and supplies. Though we need to continue with these purchases, the cost is significant enough that we are postponing other projects to accommodate these cost changes.\u201d",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate has held steady at 4.2%, still considered low \u2014 but most economists say that is partly a function of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, which has shrunk the overall labor force. The unemployment rate among native-born Americans reached a pandemic-era high last month of 4.7%.",
      "Business leaders are shaken up, too. Gartner Research said this week that its measure of CEO confidence has fallen at one of the fastest paces ever to recessionary levels, with 78% of top executives indicating they\u2019re implementing cost-cutting measures to safeguard performance. On Tuesday, equipment manufacturers Caterpillar and Eaton both reported significant profit hits from tariffs that constrained financial results amid resilient demand.",
      "\u201cWith the prospect of higher tariffs, many companies implemented strong cost saving measures,\u201d Gartner said. \u201cEven companies not directly impacted by tariffs began implementing these measures.\u201d",
      "There remains an outside chance that the courts will strike the tariffs down. A group of small businesses has sued the Trump administration challenging its authority to impose tariffs under emergency powers. A trade court agreed in late May, but Trump\u2019s lawyers obtained an injunction to keep the tariffs he had already imposed in effect. All of Trump\u2019s tariffs on individual trading partners have been deployed using the law, which faces additional challenges from other suits.",
      "Tariffs he has imposed on specific goods, like steel and copper, have been issued under a separate authority.",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of senators passed a bill to assert Congress\u2019 authority as the only body allowed to impose tariffs, but the measure stalled in the House.",
      "A growing chorus of analysts is raising the prospect of stagflationary conditions, in which price growth increases while the job market weakens.",
      "\u201cEconomic activity and job growth are sputtering under the weight of higher tariffs, increasing inflation and rising economic policy and trade uncertainty,\u201d analysts with BMO said in a recent note to clients.",
      "As higher tariff rates continue to creep up, stagflation and even a recession become likelier, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told NBC News last week.",
      "\u201cI think the economic fallout from the tariffs is now obvious: higher inflation and a struggling economy,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Craving french fries? Dunking your spuds in a deep fryer might be a recipe for elevating your risk of Type 2 diabetes.",
      "According to a study published Wednesday in the journal BMJ, swapping out your weekly dose of frites for boiled, baked or mashed potatoes could lower your risk of this chronic condition.",
      "The authors examined the diets of more than 205,000 adults in the U.S. who responded to questionnaires about what they ate over nearly four decades. Among those who consumed potatoes, the authors looked at which people developed Type 2 diabetes, a disease that leads to persistently high blood sugar levels.",
      "Eating three weekly servings of french fries, they found, was associated with a 20% increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. But consuming the same amount of boiled, baked or mashed potatoes did not appear to be linked to the disease.",
      "The vast majority of the 1 in 10 people with diabetes in the U.S. have Type 2. The condition can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes or kidney damage.",
      "The findings underscore that the way foods are prepared is key to their overall health risks or benefits, said Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, the study\u2019s lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cNot all potatoes are created equal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a small amount of french fries, less than one serving in the week, is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes.\u201d",
      "Unlike boiled or baked potatoes, french fries are deep-fried in oils that usually contain trans or saturated fats. The way the body metabolizes those fats can contribute to insulin resistance \u2014 when cells don\u2019t respond properly to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Regular consumption of fried foods can also lead to obesity and inflammation, both of which raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes.",
      "\u201cWhen you fry the potatoes, the energy content \u2014 calories \u2014 increases because of the fat they absorb. If you eat many servings of french fries, it predisposes [people] to weight gain,\u201d said Candida Rebello, the director of the nutrition and chronic disease program at Louisiana State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "The study relied on data collected between 1984 and 2021, when several different frying methods were popular. Most fast-food chains today prepare fries using vegetable oils like canola, sunflower, soybean or peanut oil. But during the 1980s, beef tallow was common. And in the early 1990s, restaurants shifted to partially hydrogenated oils. (The oils were a major source of trans fat in the U.S. diet and were largely phased out of the food industry by 2018.)",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said the seed oils used today are \u201cpoisoning\u201d Americans and contributing to high levels of obesity in children. He has advocated for restaurants to switch back to beef tallow, a recommendation that isn\u2019t backed by scientific research.",
      "\u201cBeef tallow is high in saturated fats and other harmful fats. We definitely don\u2019t recommend that,\u201d Mousavi said.",
      "One limitation of Mousavi\u2019s study is that it did not account for people adding unhealthy ingredients to their boiled, baked or mashed potatoes.",
      "\u201cWhat do people add to baked potatoes? Butter, bacon, cheese, sour cream,\u201d said Shannon Galyean, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University, who wasn\u2019t part of the research. \u201cThen we also don\u2019t know, did they eat it with the skins?\u201d",
      "Galyean said potato skins contain nutrients such as fiber, which helps with blood sugar control. And potatoes, when they aren\u2019t deep-fried or slathered in butter, can be a useful source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure.",
      "\u201cDefinitely, potatoes can be considered a healthy food when you don\u2019t fry it, or when you don\u2019t add lots of fat to it,\u201d Galyean said.",
      "Mousavi said baking french fries at home with a healthier oil, such as olive or avocado oil, could help lower one\u2019s diabetes risk compared to eating them from fast-food restaurants. Swapping out potatoes with whole grains, such as farro or whole-grain bread or pasta, could make an even bigger difference. These foods have a lower glycemic index, meaning they\u2019re less likely to spike blood sugar levels.",
      "His study found that whole grains, when compared to all types of potatoes, were less likely to elevate one\u2019s diabetes risk. White rice, on the other hand, had a stronger association with Type 2 diabetes than either of these foods.",
      "Megan Mulcahy, the director of communications at Potatoes USA, a marketing and research organization that supports potato consumption, said fries can \u201cabsolutely be part of a healthy eating pattern when enjoyed in moderation.\u201d",
      "Galyean said it\u2019s important to consider a person\u2019s overall diet, which has a greater impact on their health than any individual food. Nutritionists generally recommend a colorful plate with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins such as fish, beans or nuts.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t eat just one thing; they eat meals,\u201d Galyean said."

      "On Monday, an NBC News investigation examined how Chi Alpha pastors guided hundreds of students to Daniel Savala, a convicted sex offender heralded by some as \u201cthe holiest man alive.\u201d In signed statements, lawsuits and criminal filings, at least 10 men and boys have accused Savala of sexually abusing them, many at his Houston home and in his backyard sauna. The reporting revealed that senior Assemblies of God officials were warned repeatedly about Savala but failed to cut off his influence, allowing more teens and young men to be abused.",
      "Two days later, Clay and other Assemblies of God leaders defended their handling of the matter and pledged to take steps to prevent anything like it from happening again.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to identifying within our system, within our structures, what\u2019s broken, what can be fixed to prevent these kinds of things,\u201d said Clay, the denomination\u2019s general superintendent.",

Assemblies of God officials said Wednesday that they wouldn\u2019t publish an internal investigation into Savala\u2019s abuses to protect the privacy of those involved.",
      "Joseph Cleveland, a former Chi Alpha member who says Savala sexually abused him for more than a decade beginning when he was 15, said he was disappointed by what he saw as a continued lack of transparency.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion no Assemblies of God minister, at any level, took actions needed to rid their ministry of Savala,\u201d said Cleveland, noting state denomination officials were warned about Savala as early as 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge that pedophiles escalate in their crimes over time, and the Assemblies of God did not even investigate these Chi Alphas to find out what was going on.\u201d",

      "The focus on the Chi Alpha abuse scandal brought a somber tone to what\u2019s meant to be a time of celebration and reflection. The General Council of the Assemblies of God \u2014 the U.S. governing body of the world\u2019s largest Pentecostal denomination \u2014 meets every two years to elect officers, consider policy changes and celebrate victories in its mission to spread the gospel. The denomination has nearly 3 million members across 13,000 churches in the United States.",
      "In prepared remarks, denomination leaders spent more than 30 minutes outlining changes they have made in Chi Alpha, a co-ed ministry on hundreds of college campuses, including new training in sex abuse prevention. They also described their efforts to investigate since several young men came forward accusing Savala of abuse in 2023.",
      "Dozens of boys and young men have described how Savala spun his own twisted version of the gospel. In a quiet, comforting voice, he read Scripture and offered answers to life\u2019s deepest mysteries. To get closer to Jesus, young Christians from across Texas learned, they needed only to get closer to Savala. And to do that, the first step was often the same: stripping naked in his sauna.",
      "Savala was arrested in 2023 and charged with sexually abusing four boys since 2005, all of whom he met through pastors connected to Chi Alpha. He has yet to enter a plea to any of the charges, and he and his lawyers didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThere are no words,\u201d Donna L. Barrett, the denomination\u2019s general secretary, told the pastors gathered in Orlando on Wednesday. \u201cNo words that can capture the sorrow we feel for those targeted and impacted by this.\u201d",
      "Barrett acknowledged that the Assemblies of God\u2019s national office received reports about Savala\u2019s connection to Chi Alpha in 2018 \u2014 six years after he\u2019d been convicted of child sex abuse in Alaska. She said the national office responded by contacting church officials in Texas and believed that Chi Alpha pastors were warned to stay away from Savala.",
      "\u2018Pastors and Prey\u2019: NBC News investigates sex abuse in Assemblies of God churches",
      "A revered missionary who was also a convicted sex offender urged generations of Chi Alpha members to get naked in his Houston sauna. Assemblies of God church leaders allowed a children\u2019s pastor to continue preaching for years after he was accused of sexually abusing girls.An NBC News documentary traces the 40-year fight to stop a preacher accused of raping children.",

      "An NBC News documentary traces the 40-year fight to stop a preacher accused of raping children.",
      "Barrett also defended the denomination\u2019s refusal to release the findings of an investigation by a law firm, because, she said, doing so would violate the privacy of victims and deter others from coming forward. Ultimately, Barrett said, the evidence showed that nobody in the national office \u201chad information that any sexual misconduct was occurring in Chi Alpha until 2023.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if misrepresented in public forums, we are deeply committed to follow this principle: What did you know? When did you know it? And what did you do with the information you knew?\u201d Barrett said.",
      "Ron Bloomingkemper Jr., a former Chi Alpha member and activist who says Savala propositioned him in the 1990s, isn\u2019t satisfied with the answers the Assemblies of God has provided and is calling for greater transparency. The same concern drove him to launch an online forum in 2023 to expose abuses in Chi Alpha. The website triggered dozens of testimonials about spiritual and sexual abuse in the ministry, followed by a cascade of lawsuits and criminal charges against Savala and some of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in the Assemblies of God.",
      "The denomination dismissed six ministers who had ties to Savala \u2014 including at least one now facing criminal charges \u2014 and suspended four others who were ordered into a rehabilitation program meant to restore them to ministry, Barrett said Wednesday.",
      "Bloomingkemper said those actions didn\u2019t address what he sees as the root of the problem: a leadership culture that he says didn\u2019t take necessary action to protect students from a sex predator until public pressure built.",
      "\u201cNothing happened of any significance until the forum was launched, the news media picked it up, and the lawsuits started,\u201d Bloomingkemper said. \u201cIf those three things didn\u2019t happen, Daniel Savala would still be in there, abusing kids. Nothing would have changed.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Texas Republicans' move to redraw their congressional map mid-decade and Democrats' retaliatory redistricting efforts have captured national attention for a very simple reason: How House districts are drawn can shape American politics for years.",
      "Gerrymandering generally reduces the number of competitive races, and it can lock in nearly immovable advantages for one party or another. Under the new map proposed in Texas, no seat\u2019s presidential vote would have been decided by single digits in 2024, and Republicans would have a path to pad their narrow congressional majority in the 2026 midterm elections. This means more people could reside in congressional districts under solid control of one party.",
      "NBC News analyzed how the question of who draws the maps \u2014 and how they do it \u2014 can shape elections for years afterward.",
      "The difference between safe seats and competitive districts",
      "Who draws district lines can make the difference between contested general elections in a state in November and elections that are barely more than formalities.",
      "NBC News analyzed every House race in the country from 2012 to 2020, the last full 10-year redistricting cycle, based on how each district was drawn. In states where state legislators drew the maps, single-digit races (elections in which the winners won by less than 10 percentage points) were rarest. Only 10.7% of House races fell into that competitive category.",
      "There are plenty of reasons that don't involve gerrymandering. For one thing, voters of both parties have increasingly clustered in recent years, leaving fewer places around the country that are politically divided.",
      "Still, gerrymandering does play a significant role. When commissions or state or federal courts drew the lines last decade, the rate of competitive elections jumped, though safe seats are still overwhelmingly likely. Competitive elections were especially prevalent in states with court-drawn districts: 18.1% of races in those states had single-digit margins from 2012 through 2020.",
      "A look at Pennsylvania, whose legislative-drawn map was thrown out and replaced in 2018 by the state Supreme Court, illustrates the dramatic change that can come based on who draws congressional lines. The same state with the same voters living in the same places suddenly had many more competitive elections.",
      "From 2012 through 2016, just three of Pennsylvania's 54 House general elections under the initial map had single-digit margins.",
      "After the state Supreme Court threw out the map and imposed a new one, the number of battleground races bumped up. Eight of 36 House races had single-digit margins in 2018 and 2020.",
      "Meanwhile, ahead of the 2026 midterms, The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rates 40 House districts as toss-ups or slightly leaning toward one party. More than half (23) of those 40 competitive districts are in states where commissions or courts drew the maps.",
      "How a state's partisanship compares with whom it sends to Congress",
      "The power of the redistricting process can bend a state's representation in Congress away from its overall partisanship, with wide differences between the statewide vote in some states and the makeup of their House delegations.",
      "Take Illinois, for example, where Donald Trump got 44% of the vote in 2024. Republicans hold only three of the state\u2019s 17 seats in Congress, or 18%. (NBC News is looking at presidential data instead of House data here because some races are uncontested.) And even though Trump got 38% of the vote in California last year, Republicans hold only 17% \u2014 that\u2019s nine seats \u2014 of the state\u2019s 52 congressional districts.",
      "On the other side of the ledger, Trump got 58% support in South Carolina last year, and 86% of the state's House delegation is Republican. In North Carolina, 51% voted for Trump last year, and Republicans have 71% of the delegation.",
      "The comparison between House seats and presidential election performance isn\u2019t perfect. But it demonstrates that how district lines are drawn can generate different results from what statewide results might suggest.",
      "Right in the middle of the chart is Virginia. Its 11 congressional districts split 6-5 for Democrats, meaning Republicans hold nearly 46% of the state\u2019s seats in Congress, and Trump won 46% of the vote in Virginia last year.",
      "Also, just because a state\u2019s maps favor one party compared with the statewide results after one election doesn\u2019t mean the redistricting process was biased. Tightly divided Pennsylvania has seven Democrats and 10 Republicans in Congress, and three GOP-held districts are rated as toss-up or lean-Republican races in 2026, according to the Cook Political Report.",
      "Each state charts its own course",
      "Since each state is responsible for handling its own redistricting, the process is different depending on where you look, giving immense power to different institutions state by state.",
      "In 27 states, legislatures approved the maps. In seven, independent commissions approved them, seven had court-approved maps, two had political commissions, and one state\u2019s maps were approved by a backup commission, according to data from Loyola Law School. (The six states that elect only one person to the House don\u2019t draw new congressional maps.)",
      "Loyola Law School\u2019s \"All About Redistricting\" website defines politician commissions as panels elected officials can serve on as members. The website defines backup commissions as backup procedures if legislatures can\u2019t agree on new lines.",
      "Some independent redistricting commissions aren't as powerful as those in other states. New York has an independent commission, but the Legislature overrode its map and passed its own in 2024."

    "story": [
      "After months of delays and extensions, President Donald Trump\u2019s comprehensive and sweeping tariffs slate took effect Thursday just after midnight ET, shifting his global trade reset into high gear.",
      "Most imports into the United States will now face a baseline 10% duty, with the overall average effective tariff rate rising to more than 17% \u2014 the highest since 1935, during the Great Depression \u2014 thanks to higher duties on some of the biggest U.S. trading partners, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab think tank.",
      "A wide variety of products will be hit. Tariffs will be collected on everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China and TVs from South Korea. Selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and a suite of goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected.",
      "Together, the duties are the most significant move yet by a president set on tilting the global economy even more in favor of the United States.",
      "Trump was online to celebrate the moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s midnight! Billions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States of America!\u201d he said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.",
      "So far, the duties have mainly been jostling the U.S. economy instead. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.",
      "Yale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.",
      "Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive, either.",
      "Trump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.",
      "Trump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.",
      "Trump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.",
      "The Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Market analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending.",
      "Overall, the U.S. economy as a whole now appears to be on much shakier ground than at the start of the year. Price growth has continued to pick up, while employment growth in manufacturing \u2014 the sector Trump and his allies have said would benefit most from the tariffs \u2014 has flatlined.",
      "Some of that may also be attributable to elevated interest rates. But even non-manufacturing sectors are feeling the pinch.",
      "Comments cited in the Institute for Supply Chain Management\u2019s survey of service-providing businesses for July, released this week, were filled with concerns about tariffs.",
      "\u201cAnticipation of the final tariff impacts is resulting in delayed planning for next fiscal year purchases,\u201d an accommodation and food-services firm said.",
      "A health services firm said: \u201cTariffs are causing additional costs as we continue to purchase equipment and supplies. Though we need to continue with these purchases, the cost is significant enough that we are postponing other projects to accommodate these cost changes.\u201d",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate has held steady at 4.2%, still considered low \u2014 but most economists say that is partly a function of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, which has shrunk the overall labor force. The unemployment rate among native-born Americans reached a pandemic-era high last month of 4.7%.",
      "Business leaders are shaken up, too. Gartner Research said this week that its measure of CEO confidence has fallen at one of the fastest paces ever to recessionary levels, with 78% of top executives indicating they\u2019re implementing cost-cutting measures to safeguard performance. On Tuesday, equipment manufacturers Caterpillar and Eaton both reported significant profit hits from tariffs that constrained financial results amid resilient demand.",
      "\u201cWith the prospect of higher tariffs, many companies implemented strong cost saving measures,\u201d Gartner said. \u201cEven companies not directly impacted by tariffs began implementing these measures.\u201d",
      "There remains an outside chance that the courts will strike the tariffs down. A group of small businesses has sued the Trump administration challenging its authority to impose tariffs under emergency powers. A trade court agreed in late May, but Trump\u2019s lawyers obtained an injunction to keep the tariffs he had already imposed in effect. All of Trump\u2019s tariffs on individual trading partners have been deployed using the law, which faces additional challenges from other suits.",
      "Tariffs he has imposed on specific goods, like steel and copper, have been issued under a separate authority.",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of senators passed a bill to assert Congress\u2019 authority as the only body allowed to impose tariffs, but the measure stalled in the House.",
      "A growing chorus of analysts is raising the prospect of stagflationary conditions, in which price growth increases while the job market weakens.",
      "\u201cEconomic activity and job growth are sputtering under the weight of higher tariffs, increasing inflation and rising economic policy and trade uncertainty,\u201d analysts with BMO said in a recent note to clients.",
      "As higher tariff rates continue to creep up, stagflation and even a recession become likelier, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told NBC News last week.",
      "\u201cI think the economic fallout from the tariffs is now obvious: higher inflation and a struggling economy,\u201d he said."

      "The reports, which are widely anticipated and read around the world, have been composed by U.S. diplomats under congressional mandate for almost 50 years as a measure of countries\u2019 adherence to internationally recognized human rights. The report for last year, which normally would have been released in the spring, has already been delayed by months.",
      "\u201cThe 2024 Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancies, increases report readability and is more responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report,\u201d a senior State Department official said Wednesday in a briefing to reporters.",

      "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers have \u201cweaponized\u201d the legal and judicial system to oppress women and girls in what amounts to \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d the independent U.N. investigator on human rights in the country said.",
      "Richard Bennett said in a report to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Wednesday that after seizing power in 2021 the Taliban suspended the 2004 constitution and laws protecting the rights of women and girls. These include a landmark law that criminalized 22 forms of violence against women, including rape and child and forced marriage.",
      "The Taliban dismissed all judges under the previous U.S.-backed government, including approximately 270 women, replacing them with men who share their extreme Islamic views, lack legal training and hand down decisions based on edicts issued by the Taliban, he said.",
      "In addition, he noted that the Taliban have assumed full control over law enforcement and investigative agencies, systematically purging Afghans who worked for the previous government.",
      "Bennett, who was appointed by the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council, focused on access to justice and protection for women and girls in his report. He said he held meetings, focus-group discussions and one-on-one interviews with more that 110 Afghans inside and outside the country. He did so remotely because the Taliban have refused to grant him a visa to travel to Afghanistan.",
      "Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, their crackdown on women and girls has been widely reported and globally denounced.",
      "Taliban leaders have barred education for women and girls beyond sixth grade, banned most employment, and prohibited women from many public spaces, including parks, gyms and hairdressers. New laws ban women\u2019s voices and bare faces outside the home.",
      "The Taliban remain isolated from the West because of their restrictions on women and girls and have only been recognized by Russia.",
      "Bennett said the Taliban did not respond to an advance copy of the report and a request for information about their efforts to ensure access to justice and protection for women and girls.",
      "The Taliban defend their approach to justice by claiming they are implementing Islamic sharia law, but Islamic scholars and others have said their interpretation is unparalleled in other Muslim-majority countries and does not adhere to Islamic teachings. They say protecting the legal rights of women is a priority.",
      "Bennett said, however, that women have virtually no rights.",
      "\u201cToday, there are no women judges or prosecutors and no officially registered female lawyers, leaving women and girls with fewer safe channels to report abuse or seek redress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCoupled with a lack of female officials in the police and other institutions, the result is widespread underreporting of violence and discrimination against women and girls.\u201d",
      "Bennett said access to justice for girls \u201cis further undermined by the dismantling of key legal safeguards and institutions protecting the rights of children,\u201d including juvenile courts and juvenile rehabilitation centers.",
      "The Taliban requirement that a woman must be accompanied by a male relative also creates barriers to filing complaints and attending court proceedings, he said, and disproportionately affects widows, women who are the heads of their households, the displaced and disabled.",
      "\u201cWomen who engage with the Taliban court system \u2014 whether as victims seeking redress, to resolve family issues, to obtain official documents or as alleged offenders \u2014 face a hostile environment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCourts often reject complaints made by women and are especially reluctant to accept cases relating to divorce, child custody and gender-based violence.\u201d",
      "Facing these obstacles, Bennett said, women increasingly turn to traditional and informal justice mechanisms, including formal jirgas and shuras \u2014 community councils of elders \u2014 and informal mediation by religious leaders, community elders or family. But these are all male-dominated and raise \u201cserious concerns about the rights of women and girls,\u201d he said.",
      "He said international forums offer the best hope for justice. He pointed to the International Criminal Court\u2019s request on Jan. 23 for arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders accused of crimes against humanity for persecution \u201con gender grounds.\u201d And he urged all countries to support efforts to bring Afghanistan before the International Court of Justice, the U.N.\u2019s highest tribunal, for violating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."

    "story": [
      "This article is part of \u201cPastors and Prey,\u201d a series investigating sex abuse allegations in the Assemblies of God.",
      "Speaking to thousands of pastors gathered Wednesday in Orlando, Florida, for a biennial meeting of the Assemblies of God, the Pentecostal denomination\u2019s senior leader, Doug Clay, began by addressing an issue that has \u201cput a stain on the church and a scar on people\u2019s lives\u201d \u2014 sex abuse in the Chi Alpha college ministry.",
      "On Monday, an NBC News investigation examined how Chi Alpha pastors guided hundreds of students to Daniel Savala, a convicted sex offender heralded by some as \u201cthe holiest man alive.\u201d In signed statements, lawsuits and criminal filings, at least 10 men and boys have accused Savala of sexually abusing them, many at his Houston home and in his backyard sauna. The reporting revealed that senior Assemblies of God officials were warned repeatedly about Savala but failed to cut off his influence, allowing more teens and young men to be abused.",
      "Two days later, Clay and other Assemblies of God leaders defended their handling of the matter and pledged to take steps to prevent anything like it from happening again.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to identifying within our system, within our structures, what\u2019s broken, what can be fixed to prevent these kinds of things,\u201d said Clay, the denomination\u2019s general superintendent.",
      "But the promises didn\u2019t satisfy some of Savala\u2019s accusers, who say they're still waiting for the Assemblies of God to release a full accounting of what its leaders knew and how they responded to years of warnings about Savala. Assemblies of God officials said Wednesday that they wouldn\u2019t publish an internal investigation into Savala\u2019s abuses to protect the privacy of those involved.",
      "Joseph Cleveland, a former Chi Alpha member who says Savala sexually abused him for more than a decade beginning when he was 15, said he was disappointed by what he saw as a continued lack of transparency.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion no Assemblies of God minister, at any level, took actions needed to rid their ministry of Savala,\u201d said Cleveland, noting state denomination officials were warned about Savala as early as 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge that pedophiles escalate in their crimes over time, and the Assemblies of God did not even investigate these Chi Alphas to find out what was going on.\u201d",
      "Do you have a story to share about the Assemblies of God\u2019s handling of sex abuse allegations? Email reporter Mike Hixenbaugh.",
      "The focus on the Chi Alpha abuse scandal brought a somber tone to what\u2019s meant to be a time of celebration and reflection. The General Council of the Assemblies of God \u2014 the U.S. governing body of the world\u2019s largest Pentecostal denomination \u2014 meets every two years to elect officers, consider policy changes and celebrate victories in its mission to spread the gospel. The denomination has nearly 3 million members across 13,000 churches in the United States.",
      "In prepared remarks, denomination leaders spent more than 30 minutes outlining changes they have made in Chi Alpha, a co-ed ministry on hundreds of college campuses, including new training in sex abuse prevention. They also described their efforts to investigate since several young men came forward accusing Savala of abuse in 2023.",
      "Dozens of boys and young men have described how Savala spun his own twisted version of the gospel. In a quiet, comforting voice, he read Scripture and offered answers to life\u2019s deepest mysteries. To get closer to Jesus, young Christians from across Texas learned, they needed only to get closer to Savala. And to do that, the first step was often the same: stripping naked in his sauna.",
      "Savala was arrested in 2023 and charged with sexually abusing four boys since 2005, all of whom he met through pastors connected to Chi Alpha. He has yet to enter a plea to any of the charges, and he and his lawyers didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThere are no words,\u201d Donna L. Barrett, the denomination\u2019s general secretary, told the pastors gathered in Orlando on Wednesday. \u201cNo words that can capture the sorrow we feel for those targeted and impacted by this.\u201d",
      "Barrett acknowledged that the Assemblies of God\u2019s national office received reports about Savala\u2019s connection to Chi Alpha in 2018 \u2014 six years after he\u2019d been convicted of child sex abuse in Alaska. She said the national office responded by contacting church officials in Texas and believed that Chi Alpha pastors were warned to stay away from Savala.",

      "An NBC News documentary traces the 40-year fight to stop a preacher accused of raping children.",
      "Barrett also defended the denomination\u2019s refusal to release the findings of an investigation by a law firm, because, she said, doing so would violate the privacy of victims and deter others from coming forward. Ultimately, Barrett said, the evidence showed that nobody in the national office \u201chad information that any sexual misconduct was occurring in Chi Alpha until 2023.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if misrepresented in public forums, we are deeply committed to follow this principle: What did you know? When did you know it? And what did you do with the information you knew?\u201d Barrett said.",
      "Ron Bloomingkemper Jr., a former Chi Alpha member and activist who says Savala propositioned him in the 1990s, isn\u2019t satisfied with the answers the Assemblies of God has provided and is calling for greater transparency. The same concern drove him to launch an online forum in 2023 to expose abuses in Chi Alpha. The website triggered dozens of testimonials about spiritual and sexual abuse in the ministry, followed by a cascade of lawsuits and criminal charges against Savala and some of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in the Assemblies of God.",
      "The denomination dismissed six ministers who had ties to Savala \u2014 including at least one now facing criminal charges \u2014 and suspended four others who were ordered into a rehabilitation program meant to restore them to ministry, Barrett said Wednesday.",
      "Bloomingkemper said those actions didn\u2019t address what he sees as the root of the problem: a leadership culture that he says didn\u2019t take necessary action to protect students from a sex predator until public pressure built.",
      "\u201cNothing happened of any significance until the forum was launched, the news media picked it up, and the lawsuits started,\u201d Bloomingkemper said. \u201cIf those three things didn\u2019t happen, Daniel Savala would still be in there, abusing kids. Nothing would have changed.\u201d"

      "The chief executive officer of Canine Companions, the organization that runs the programs at Maxwell\u2019s new institution and others, told NBC News that the puppy training is off limits to inmates like Maxwell.",
      "\u201cWe do not allow anyone whose crime involves abuse towards minors or animals \u2014 including any crime of a sexual nature,\u201d said Paige Mazzoni, who has been leading Canine Companions since 2018. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard policy we have, so she will not be able to.\u201d",

The unusual question-and-answer session was set up as the Trump administration has sought to quell an uproar over its handling of the Epstein case.",

But the disclosure of roughly 200 documents in February yielded no significant revelations. And last month, the Justice Department and FBI announced that an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d had not uncovered evidence that justified criminally investigating other individuals.

      "NBC News reported Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering publicly releasing the transcript of Blanche\u2019s two-day meeting with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting minors to be sexually abused by Epstein.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s transfer to the prison camp has also generated controversy. It is typically not a destination for people convicted of sex crimes.",
      "The service dog training program is among the special opportunities available to inmates at Federal Prison Camp Bryan. Canine Companions runs such programs at 25 state and federal detention facilities across the country.",
      "The first prison-based program was launched at a facility in Oregon in 1995, but they are especially vital now amid a national shortage of service dogs, according to Mazzoni.",
      "\u201cWe need more dogs, and we need more volunteers,\u201d Mazzoni said.",
      "About two years ago, Canine Companions began to focus on growing its prison-based programs. Mazzoni said the reasons are twofold: the facilities are home to a large number of potential volunteers and, interestingly, dogs trained by inmates have a higher rate of successfully completing the program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because there\u2019s so much discipline and time in prison to spend really focusing on training the dogs,\u201d Mazzoni said.",
      "An added benefit: Inmates who have gone through the program also have lower recidivism rates, Mazzoni said.",
      "\u201cWe get letters from the incarcerated people saying things like, \u2018It\u2019s the first time I felt unconditional love,\u2019 and, \u2018It\u2019s my chance to give back to society,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOne of our board members loves to say, \u2018If that dog doesn\u2019t make it as a service dog, it\u2019s still changed a life.\u2019\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Craving french fries? Dunking your spuds in a deep fryer might be a recipe for elevating your risk of Type 2 diabetes.",
      "According to a study published Wednesday in the journal BMJ, swapping out your weekly dose of frites for boiled, baked or mashed potatoes could lower your risk of this chronic condition.",
      "The authors examined the diets of more than 205,000 adults in the U.S. who responded to questionnaires about what they ate over nearly four decades. Among those who consumed potatoes, the authors looked at which people developed Type 2 diabetes, a disease that leads to persistently high blood sugar levels.",
      "Eating three weekly servings of french fries, they found, was associated with a 20% increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. But consuming the same amount of boiled, baked or mashed potatoes did not appear to be linked to the disease.",
      "The vast majority of the 1 in 10 people with diabetes in the U.S. have Type 2. The condition can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes or kidney damage.",
      "The findings underscore that the way foods are prepared is key to their overall health risks or benefits, said Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, the study\u2019s lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cNot all potatoes are created equal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a small amount of french fries, less than one serving in the week, is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes.\u201d",
      "Unlike boiled or baked potatoes, french fries are deep-fried in oils that usually contain trans or saturated fats. The way the body metabolizes those fats can contribute to insulin resistance \u2014 when cells don\u2019t respond properly to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Regular consumption of fried foods can also lead to obesity and inflammation, both of which raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes.",
      "\u201cWhen you fry the potatoes, the energy content \u2014 calories \u2014 increases because of the fat they absorb. If you eat many servings of french fries, it predisposes [people] to weight gain,\u201d said Candida Rebello, the director of the nutrition and chronic disease program at Louisiana State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "The study relied on data collected between 1984 and 2021, when several different frying methods were popular. Most fast-food chains today prepare fries using vegetable oils like canola, sunflower, soybean or peanut oil. But during the 1980s, beef tallow was common. And in the early 1990s, restaurants shifted to partially hydrogenated oils. (The oils were a major source of trans fat in the U.S. diet and were largely phased out of the food industry by 2018.)",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said the seed oils used today are \u201cpoisoning\u201d Americans and contributing to high levels of obesity in children. He has advocated for restaurants to switch back to beef tallow, a recommendation that isn\u2019t backed by scientific research.",
      "\u201cBeef tallow is high in saturated fats and other harmful fats. We definitely don\u2019t recommend that,\u201d Mousavi said.",
      "One limitation of Mousavi\u2019s study is that it did not account for people adding unhealthy ingredients to their boiled, baked or mashed potatoes.",
      "\u201cWhat do people add to baked potatoes? Butter, bacon, cheese, sour cream,\u201d said Shannon Galyean, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University, who wasn\u2019t part of the research. \u201cThen we also don\u2019t know, did they eat it with the skins?\u201d",
      "Galyean said potato skins contain nutrients such as fiber, which helps with blood sugar control. And potatoes, when they aren\u2019t deep-fried or slathered in butter, can be a useful source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure.",
      "\u201cDefinitely, potatoes can be considered a healthy food when you don\u2019t fry it, or when you don\u2019t add lots of fat to it,\u201d Galyean said.",
      "Mousavi said baking french fries at home with a healthier oil, such as olive or avocado oil, could help lower one\u2019s diabetes risk compared to eating them from fast-food restaurants. Swapping out potatoes with whole grains, such as farro or whole-grain bread or pasta, could make an even bigger difference. These foods have a lower glycemic index, meaning they\u2019re less likely to spike blood sugar levels.",
      "His study found that whole grains, when compared to all types of potatoes, were less likely to elevate one\u2019s diabetes risk. White rice, on the other hand, had a stronger association with Type 2 diabetes than either of these foods.",
      "Megan Mulcahy, the director of communications at Potatoes USA, a marketing and research organization that supports potato consumption, said fries can \u201cabsolutely be part of a healthy eating pattern when enjoyed in moderation.\u201d",
      "Galyean said it\u2019s important to consider a person\u2019s overall diet, which has a greater impact on their health than any individual food. Nutritionists generally recommend a colorful plate with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins such as fish, beans or nuts.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t eat just one thing; they eat meals,\u201d Galyean said."

      "Although Season 1 and the current season highlighted the seemingly unbreakable bond between the five ladies as they tackled London\u2019s high society in the 1870s, the episodes leading up to the Season 2 finale hinted that tension between a couple of them would boil over. Prior to Nan\u2019s grand masquerade ball to mark the end of the season, she confronts Lizzy about a secret she has been keeping.",

She points out that flirting isn\u2019t easy \u201cfor people like me\u201d and that it is a struggle to find others like herself in rigid high society. Mabel says she wants to show gay men and women that love is possible. So, she suggests that she work with Conchita to turn her matchmaking operation into a business that brings gay people together.

      "Nan confronts Lizzy and calls her out for betraying her. Lizzy explains that she only let herself fall for Theo when she was certain that Nan didn\u2019t want to be with him anymore. But Lizzy says she will always choose her friend over him. Nan rejects this, adding that Lizzy hasn\u2019t been thinking about her the whole time.",
      "Lizzy then pushes back, accusing Nan of being sanctimonious, given that she was in a love triangle with Theo and Guy, his best friend. Nan counters that Lizzy isn\u2019t who the world thinks she is and everyone deserves to know \u201cthe truth\u201d before storming off.",

Patti and her come up with a plan: to publicly announce her pregnancy at the ball to catch Theo off guard and prevent his family from excluding her.",

      "Lizzy chases after her and the two argue again. Nan wonders how their friendship crumbled. She yells at Lizzy before letting it slip that she is pregnant. She asks Lizzy to keep her secret. Nan wishes Lizzy good luck lying to Theo and runs off. The last shot of the season shows Nan fleeing down the beach with a smile on her face.",

      "Fr\u00f8seth says she joked with Hendricks that the two could raise Nan\u2019s baby in the countryside. Fr\u00f8seth then shares what she hopes to see from her character in a potential Season 3.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m being serious. I actually think that she should be by herself, and I was really proud of her when she made that decision,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really courageous decision to leave things behind, but I think things have gotten so toxic within the friendships, within the men. There\u2019s so much happening and she\u2019s been making a lot of sacrifices and too many impulsive decisions. It\u2019s just time to get away.\u201d",
      "Who Is Theo\u2019s Brother?",
      "Theo\u2019s mom (Amelia Bullmore) speaks to Hector\u2019s dad, her longtime love, following Theo\u2019s speech.

Laurel is a descendant of  Joseph Crackstone, who attempted to wipe out all outcasts in Jericho, where Nevermore is located. Following her familial pursuit, Laurel used the Hyde to kill off as many outcasts as she could, while simultaneously collecting body parts to resurrect Crackstone.",

      "Singer Ozzy Osbourne reportedly died of a heart attack when he passed away on July 22 at the age of 76.",
      "Cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease with autonomic dysfunction were also listed as causes in the death certificate, according to The New York Times and The Sun.",
      "Osbourne announced in 2020 he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's. In 2025, his wife, Sharon, said that the disease left him unable to walk. It also caused him to struggle with his speech, but didn't affect his voice.",
      "The heavy metal star, who was nicknamed the \u201cPrince of Darkness,\u201d had been dealing with a host of health problems leading up to his death.",
      "He had surgery on his neck and spine after an all-terrain vehicle accident in 2003 and suffered from blood clots in his legs. Osbourne also struggled with drug and alcohol addiction.",
      "\"He was with his family and surrounded by love\" when he passed away, his loved ones said in a statement.",
      "Osbourne's death came just weeks after he reunited with his original Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, for a final show in July 2025.",
      "His wife told the BBC the performance was his goodbye to the band and to his fans.",
      "Ozzy Osbourne's Causes of Death",
      "Osbourne\u2019s causes of death were: \u201c(a) Out of hospital cardiac arrest (b) Acute myocardial infarction (c) Coronary artery disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease with autonomic dysfunction (Joint Causes),\u201d according to The New York Times.",
      "Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops functioning due to an irregular rhythm. The person stops breathing and becomes unconscious. It requires immediate treatment to prevent death. The condition is different from a heart attack.",
      "In the U.S., 90% of patients who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do not survive.",
      "Also known as a heart attack, acute myocardial infarction refers to when the heart or parts of the heart are not getting enough blood flow, usually due to a blockage in an artery. A heart attack can lead to a sudden cardiac arrest.",
      "Coronary artery disease is a type of heart disease that leads to reduced blood flow to the heart. A common cause is fats, cholesterol and other substances building up in the arteries and along their walls. It takes many years to develop.",
      "Parkinson's is a degenerative brain condition that causes balance problems, shaking, difficulty moving and more. Symptoms worsen over time. In addition to affecting motor skills, it can harm the autonomic nervous system, which regulates involuntary bodily functions, like breathing, digestion and heart rate.",
      "Common autonomic nervous system symptoms in people with Parkinson's include low blood pressure, gastrointestinal problems and sexual dysfunction."

      "In a video posted to X, the Seattle Kraken mascot joined forward John Hayden on a fishing adventure. The two are dressed in fishing gear and standing in a river when a brown bear emerges from the trees and approaches the water\u2019s edge.",
      "The brush with nature happened while the troll and Hayden were taking part in a youth hockey summer camp program in Anchorage, Alaska, according to a post shared by the ice hockey team on X.",
      "\"TROLL NARROWLY ESCAPES BEAR ENCOUNTER,\" the post's caption reads. \"*No trolls or bears were hurt in the making, always respect wildlife in their natural habitat.\"",
      "The dramatic 51-second clip begins with Buoy standing beside Hayden, who tells the camera there was a close encounter with a bear during the trip.",
      "The footage cuts back to earlier in the trip, showing Hayden using a fishing reel when someone off-camera warns, \u201cWe got a bear.\u201d Over Hayden's shoulder, the bear can be seen stepping into the water.",
      "\"Oh my God,\" someone says. \"We've got to move down.\"",
      "Hayden hands off his fishing reel to a crew member, and the group cautiously begins moving to put distance between themselves and the bear.",
      "The camera follows Buoy and Hayden as they calmly wade farther into the water \u2014 just as the bear lets out a ferocious growl. Seconds later, the bear breaks into a sprint, charging at Buoy before suddenly backing off.",
      "\u201cI want to blame it on Buoy. They were pretty interested in his whole look,\u201d Hayden says later in the video about the encounter. \u201cWe got out of it OK, but it was a close call.\u201d",

      "How to tell the difference between brown and black bears?",
      "Alaska is home to three species of bears: black bears, polar bears and brown bears (which include the grizzly bear subspecies), according to the National Park Service (NPS).",
      "The brown bear in the video is easy to distinguish from a polar bear by coat color. However, telling a brown bear from a black bear is trickier since both can have brown coats. Their key differences lie in their size and physical features. Brown bears and grizzly bears have a noticeable muscular hump between their shoulders, longer claws and smaller ears, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.",
      "You might have heard the adage \"Brown, lie down. Black fight back.\" In the case of a brown bear encounter, NPS advises remaining calm \u2014 as Buoy and Hayden do in the video \u2014 and, if necessary, lying on the ground and playing dead. Black bears, however, should be approached differently if they become aggressive. NPS advises making yourself look larger, shouting, and fighting back with what\u2019s available to you in the area."

    "summary": "The cast of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" speak to TODAY.com about the parents tackling empty-nesting and grief in Season 3.",
    "story": [
      "When you think of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty,\u201d you might picture Belly\u2019s tangled love life, the Cousins Beach sunsets or the memorable soundtrack. But the grown ups get their moments, too.",
      "In \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d Season 3, the parents of Belly (Lola Tung), Steven (Sean Kaufman), Conrad (Christopher Briney), Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) and Taylor (Rain Spencer) deal with the universal theme of empty-nesting as the beloved summer crew go to college and beyond.",
      "Laurel Park (Jackie Chung), Belly and Steven Conklin's mom, continues to grieve the loss of best friend Susannah Fisher (Rachel Blanchard), who died in Season 2. Meanwhile Susannah\u2019s husband, Adam Fisher (Tom Everett Scott), struggles to step up for his two sons, Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher. Season 3 also introduces viewers to Taylor\u2019s mom, Lucinda Jewel (Kristen Connolly).",
      "If you look just beyond the love triangles, something deeper is going on: The parents are having a coming-of-age story of their own.",
      "A Child's Major Life Decision",
      "The main obstacle facing the parents of Cousins Beach is Belly and Jeremiah\u2019s engagement. Now upperclassmen in college with around four years of dating under their belt, the young lovebirds get engaged after Steven\u2019s car accident, which for Belly, puts their blowout fight over Jeremiah sleeping with someone else into a new perspective.",
      "\u201cWhen you lose someone, or almost lose someone, that can change things for you and bring you closer to the people in your life that really matter,\u201d Tung previously told TODAY.com.",
      "Before the engagement, audiences find Laurel several years after both Belly and Steven have left for college.",
      "\"I think Laurel has had quite the journey from supporting her friend through her illness, and then losing Susannah and grieving in Season 2,\" Chung tells TODAY.com. \"And so I think by the time we've hit Season 3, and time has passed, Laurel is on more, like, steady ground.\"",
      "\"With her kids gone, she has an opportunity to look around and see what's out there, and see what her life can be and look for new relationships,\" she adds. \"There's a lot of potential for Laurel.\"",
      "When it comes to parenting, she says in Season 2, \"Laurel wasn't always the best communicator.\" That was Susannah's strong suit. Chung says Laurel strives to step up to that task after Susannah's death.",
      "\"Laurel is trying really hard to communicate with her kids and Susannah's kids, and just trying to be the best parent she can be,\" she says. \"She doesn't always succeed, and she butts heads with her kids sometimes, but you know, it's all out of love.\"",
      "After Belly and Jeremiah announce their engagement over dinner in Episode 3, Laurel immediately criticizes the decision and storms out, shutting the meal down before it even begins.",
      "Chung says Laurel's overall goal is to \"set them up for success as individuals in their lives and (help them make) good decisions for themselves.\"",
      "\"I think Laurel doesn't always agree with all the decisions,\" she adds with a laugh. \"And she does her best to give her kids space, but when she has an opinion, she expresses it.\"",
      "Calling Laurel a lifetime member of \u201cTeam Belly,\u201d Chung says her character \"supports her children 100%\" but thinks it's still early in Belly's life.",
      "\"(Belly) has plenty of years to figure out who she is and who she wants to be with,\" Chung says. \"I think she'd just love for Belly to have a chance to establish that, to find her core and her base.\"",
      "Struggling to Reconnect",
      "Adam was also at that fateful dinner in Episode 3. In fact, the engagement announcement came about after he made an underhanded remark about Jeremiah being a \"super senior.\" Belly, wanting to prove that she and Jeremiah are taking their future plans seriously, then reveals they are getting married.",
      "Like Laurel, he calls Jeremiah \u201cirresponsible\" and helps shut down the dinner before appetizers hit the table.",
      "Adam has never exactly been father of the year. When Susannah got sick, he was MIA. After she passed, he stayed emotionally checked out, and in Season 2, he refused to help save the family beach house until Laurel pressured him into doing it.",
      "\u201cPeople say that Adam actually stepped up... but it was really Laurel who kind of forced his hand,\u201d Scott tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I love that scene because you see a little crack in Adam. He does get to kind of show that he\u2019s hurting and he\u2019s missing Susannah.\u201d",
      "Scott says in Season 3, his character's relationship with his sons continues to be \"rocky.\"",
      "\u201cHe is their only parent now,\u201d Scott adds. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to do the right things. He just doesn\u2019t have the tools. He\u2019s not very good at it, being present.\"",
      "But his ultimate goal is reconciliation, Scott says, adding, \"Adam is going to be more involved.\"",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to get back together with his sons and trying to make amends with them,\u201d he says.",
      "\"I know that not a lot of people like the character of Adam and what's been fun for me is playing someone and trying to make them real and trying to give them all these flaws,\" he continues. \"But also I think there is a real guy in there trying.",
      "In Season 3, Steven is notably working at Adam's venture capital firm, Breaker. Scott says through the beach house, Steven is like another son to Adam.",
      "\"He sees himself in Steven, and he likes giving him a boost,\" Scott says. \"We're going to have a lot of scenes together.\"",
      "A New Dynamic",
      "From her introduction in Season 3, Episode 1, Lucinda Jewel has been chaotic and the show\u2019s resident \u201ccool mom.\u201d",
      "She notably FaceTimed her daughter in Episode 1 with the blunt warning, \u201cRemember this: Once you\u2019ve downgraded yourself, there is no going back up, and then you\u2019re just a h\u043e.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of parent daughter relationship is switched, like Taylor feels more like the parent a bit, which is an interesting dynamic that\u2019s funny and presents its own challenges,\u201d Spencer tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cBeing a young adult (is) like, \u2018How much do I help my mom, versus listen to my heart and what I want to do and leave the nest?\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "When Taylor comes home for summer break, Lucinda greets her with a freshly cleaned house, a breakup playlist and plans to binge watch \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d Taylor divulges her boy drama, and in classic TV mom fashion, Lucinda schemes. She calls Steven, pretending to need bookkeeping help, but the plan backfires. Steven finds out Lucinda's salon is bleeding cash and might not last the month.",
      "By the end of the episode, Lucinda crumbles, crying in front of Taylor. Her response seemingly sets the stage for their arc in Season 3: \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out together.\u201d",
      "A Loss No One Can Forget",
      "While Susannah Fisher may be gone, her presence is felt everywhere.",
      "From the first scene of Season 3, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s still the emotional center of the show. Her death fractured the core group and sent each parent, and kid, on their own winding path through grief, growth and messy healing.",
      "\u201cShe was Laurel\u2019s biggest cheerleader and an instigator,\u201d Chung says. \u201cThe one who throws a party, who says, \u2018Come on, Laurel, let\u2019s dance.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her absence is felt in the quiet moments \u2014 Belly reaching for someone to guide her, Laurel learning how to open up and Adam trying to fill her shoes as a single parent. The memorial garden dedication in her name in Episode 3 brings the whole group back together, and it\u2019s her legacy that both unites and complicates them.",
      "Plus, there's a chance we'll continue to see more of Susannah in Season 3. The official X account for \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" shared photos of Rachel Blanchard on set, though it was unclear if she filmed scenes for the third season."

      "A pair of American volunteer doctors described to NBC News a barely coping hospital in Gaza, with bodies spread across the blood-smeared floors as medical staff struggled to treat hundreds of people who had been injured as they tried to access humanitarian aid.",
      "\u201cWe have children who are dead on the floor, and we are unable to move these patients just due to the sheer volume that we received,\u201d Ahmed Farhat, an emergency physician from California, said in a video message Tuesday, talking about the situation at the Nasser Medical Complex in the city of Khan Younis.",
      "\u201cWe have patients who are intubated on the floor with no sedation. We have patients who have chest tubes on the floor, patients who are bleeding out,\u201d added Farhat, who is just under two weeks into a medical mission run by the Michigan-based Rahma Worldwide, a charity founded in 2014 that operates emergency response and humanitarian relief programs across the Middle East and Africa.",
      "His comments echo those of other doctors working in Gaza who in recent interviews have lamented the lack of food and medicine being allowed into the enclave, amid international outrage over widespread starvation and deaths from malnutrition. Others have described aid distribution points as death traps, as a growing number of people have been killed or injured while seeking desperately needed food.",
      "Three short videos taken by Farhat in the Nasser Medical Complex on Tuesday showed dozens of people waiting for treatment on the hospital\u2019s floors. Some had tubes inserted to help them breathe, others were motionless.",
      "Citing hospital administration data, Farhat said in a text message Wednesday that the Nasser Complex received 453 patients within a number of hours Tuesday and that 48 of them had died.",
      "He added that his patients told him they had come under fire by Israeli forces while trying to collect aid from two sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the U.S. and Israel-backed organization that has been mired in controversy since replacing most United Nations-run relief operations in Gaza in May.",
      "In a statement to NBC News on Wednesday, the GHF, which operates four militarized food aid distribution sites across the enclave in areas where the Israeli military is active, said aid convoys belonging to the United Nations and other organizations in the past often passed near their locations and were regularly looted by large crowds.",
      "However, it said there were \u201cno incidents at or near\u201d their sites Tuesday. A spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) could not confirm whether its aid convoys had been looted near GHF sites.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the casualties at Nasser Hospital.",
      "Farhat said other patients had told him they had been fired upon in another incident near Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah while seeking aid from a United Nations aid convoy that was passing through.",
      "An OCHA spokesperson did not have any details about the specific event, but said such incidents are not uncommon.",
      "Separately, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Wednesday that 87 people had been killed and 570 injured in a series of incidents across the enclave Tuesday. A spokesperson for the ministry also said that Gaza hospitals had received the bodies of 49 people Wednesday and many of those killed were waiting for aid near U.S.-backed aid distribution points.",
      "Travis Melin, an anesthesiologist from Oregon who also volunteers at the Nasser Hospital, said the number of patients Tuesday had been \u201chuge.\u201d In a text message Wednesday, he added that he had seen the highest number of casualties at the hospital during his monthlong tenure there.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still doing emergency surgery on people who should have gone to the OR yesterday,\u201d he said.",
      "The \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d is unfolding in the Gaza Strip under Israel\u2019s assault, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger said last week. Meanwhile, most of its residents have been driven from their homes and more than 61,000 killed, including thousands of children, according to local health officials. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage.",
      "Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 injured while seeking food, the United Nations' OCHA said in an update Tuesday. \u201cAt least 859 people have been killed around GHF sites since the beginning of GHF\u2019s operations,\u201d it added."

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to push to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip\" as ceasefire talks with Hamas founder and the hunger crisis in the besieged Palestinian enclave spirals.",
      "A bid by Netanyahu to occupy all of Gaza would follow similar calls from members of his far-right government upon whom his fragile coalition relies, and could mark a significant shift in policy since Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005.",
      "Officials from Netanyahu's office said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday night that the Israeli leader had decided to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip, including areas where hostages may be held.\"",
      "The statement was shared in Hebrew and the term used can be translated to mean both \"occupy\" and \"conquer.\" Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on the intended definition, but Israeli media, including The Times of Israel, reported that Netanyahu intended to \"fully occupy\" the enclave.",
      "Israeli media reported that Netanyahu would hold a limited security meeting Tuesday to discuss the future of Israel's campaign in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu had said Monday he planned to convene the security Cabinet this week to \"instruct\" the Israeli military on how to achieve the three war objectives laid out at the start of Israel's offensive in Gaza: defeating Hamas, seeing the release of hostages who remain held in the enclave and removing the threat of possible future attacks. Asked to confirm if the meeting would take place Tuesday, his office did not respond directly and referred NBC News to his comments Monday.",
      "While the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, that left 1,200 dead and saw 250 taken hostages garnered worldwide sympathy for Israel, the country's actions in the territory have since sparked widespread international outrage.",
      "The United States remains the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, with American spending on Israel's military operations reaching more than $17.9 billion from Oct. 7 last year to Sept. 30, according to Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.",
      "There has been growing global alarm over Israel\u2019s actions in the enclave amid a hunger crisis caused by the offensive and strict restrictions on the entry of aid, marked by mounting deaths from starvation.",
      "The \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201c is unfolding in the Gaza Strip under Israel\u2019s assault, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger said last week. Meanwhile, most of its residents have been driven from their homes and more than 60,900 killed, including thousands of children, according to local health officials.",
      "Nearly 190 people in Gaza, including at least 94 children, have died from malnutrition since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.",
      "There is mounting opposition to the war among Israelis. Many have long despaired over the fate of of the estimated 20 living hostages remaining in Gaza, and recent protests have expressed outrage over the children dying from malnutrition.",
      "Fears for the hostages were also fueled after Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad released imagery in recent days showing visibly gaunt Israeli hostages Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski.",
      "Earlier this month, a group representing hundreds of retired Israeli security officials that calls itself the Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security\u2019s leadership addressed a letter to President Donald Trump calling on him to pressure Israel to end the war.",
      "In the letter, which was confirmed to NBC News, the group said it was its professional judgment that Hamas no longer posed a strategic threat \u2014 and that it was time to \u201cend the war, return the hostages\u201d and \u201cstop the suffering.\u201d",
      "While the reoccupation of Gaza is largely unpopular with the Israeli public, it is supported on the far right.",
      "Over the weekend, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza and to encourage Palestinians to leave the enclave.",
      "Ben-Gvir drew condemnation not only for his comments, but also for leading a group of worshippers in prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, violating a decades-old agreement allowing Jews to visit to Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site but not to worship there.",
      "Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza, and called for rebuilding of Israeli settlements there alongside other right-wing ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Israel captured the Gaza Strip, then occupied by Egypt, after the 1967 war, but withdrew settlers \u2014 some of them forcefully \u2014 in 2005. In 2006, residents elected the Islamist militant and political group Hamas in legislative elections, precipitating clashes with the more secular Palestinian faction of Fatah. Hamas seized full control of the enclave in 2007."

      "\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to undo, or at least hit pause on, what has been two decades of steadily improving relations between India and the U.S.,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America, a nonprofit group in Washington.",
      "On Monday, citing India\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d purchases of Russian oil, Trump said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the U.S. tariff on Indian imports, which is already one of the highest among Asian countries at 25%. Along with China, India is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil sanctioned by Western governments after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Blondie, a tourist favorite, was hunted down after being lured and baited out of Gwayi Conservancy, near Hwange National Park, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH), an advocacy organization based in the U.K.",
      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",
      "The beloved feline was killed in late June but his death only began to garner international attention in the last week.",

      "\u201cThat Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d he said.",
      "Collars are used to track the animals, limit wildlife-human conflict and support conservation.",
      "Zimbabwean law allows a maximum of 100 lions above the age of 6 to be hunted each year in the country, where safaris and big game hunting are important sources of income.",
      "A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks Agency, the government hunting regulator, denied that Blondie\u2019s killing had broken the law because he was older than 6.",
      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",
      "But Farawo denied that anything illegal happened, and said these sorts of hunts paid for conservation efforts.",
      "Born Free, another U.K.-based advocacy group, has expressed concern for Blondie\u2019s pride, saying the fate of its three female partners and a number of cubs was \u201cseriously in doubt.\u201d",
      "In 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer sparked outrage when he admittedly killed Cecil the Lion after paying $50,000 for the experience.",
      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",

      "Mark Jones, Born Free\u2019s head of policy, said that that little has been learned since Cecil\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cThe very fact that they lure lions out of national parks suggests that there are no lions remaining in the hunting areas for them to hunt, reflecting the massive damage to lion populations that trophy hunting is doing,\u201d Jones said."

      "Together, the duties are the most significant move yet by a president set on tilting the global economy even more in favor of the United States.",
      "Trump was online to celebrate the moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s midnight! Billions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States of America!\u201d he said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.",
      "So far, the duties have mainly been jostling the U.S. economy instead. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.",
      "Yale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.",
      "Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive, either.",
      "Trump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.",
      "Trump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.",
      "Trump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.",
      "The Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Market analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending.",
      "Overall, the U.S. economy as a whole now appears to be on much shakier ground than at the start of the year. Price growth has continued to pick up, while employment growth in manufacturing \u2014 the sector Trump and his allies have said would benefit most from the tariffs \u2014 has flatlined.",
      "Some of that may also be attributable to elevated interest rates. But even non-manufacturing sectors are feeling the pinch.",
      "Comments cited in the Institute for Supply Chain Management\u2019s survey of service-providing businesses for July, released this week, were filled with concerns about tariffs.",
      "\u201cAnticipation of the final tariff impacts is resulting in delayed planning for next fiscal year purchases,\u201d an accommodation and food-services firm said.",
      "A health services firm said: \u201cTariffs are causing additional costs as we continue to purchase equipment and supplies. Though we need to continue with these purchases, the cost is significant enough that we are postponing other projects to accommodate these cost changes.\u201d",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate has held steady at 4.2%, still considered low \u2014 but most economists say that is partly a function of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, which has shrunk the overall labor force. The unemployment rate among native-born Americans reached a pandemic-era high last month of 4.7%.",
      "Business leaders are shaken up, too. Gartner Research said this week that its measure of CEO confidence has fallen at one of the fastest paces ever to recessionary levels, with 78% of top executives indicating they\u2019re implementing cost-cutting measures to safeguard performance. On Tuesday, equipment manufacturers Caterpillar and Eaton both reported significant profit hits from tariffs that constrained financial results amid resilient demand.",
      "\u201cWith the prospect of higher tariffs, many companies implemented strong cost saving measures,\u201d Gartner said. \u201cEven companies not directly impacted by tariffs began implementing these measures.\u201d",
      "There remains an outside chance that the courts will strike the tariffs down. A group of small businesses has sued the Trump administration challenging its authority to impose tariffs under emergency powers. A trade court agreed in late May, but Trump\u2019s lawyers obtained an injunction to keep the tariffs he had already imposed in effect. All of Trump\u2019s tariffs on individual trading partners have been deployed using the law, which faces additional challenges from other suits.",
      "Tariffs he has imposed on specific goods, like steel and copper, have been issued under a separate authority.",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of senators passed a bill to assert Congress\u2019 authority as the only body allowed to impose tariffs, but the measure stalled in the House.",
      "A growing chorus of analysts is raising the prospect of stagflationary conditions, in which price growth increases while the job market weakens.",
      "\u201cEconomic activity and job growth are sputtering under the weight of higher tariffs, increasing inflation and rising economic policy and trade uncertainty,\u201d analysts with BMO said in a recent note to clients.",
      "As higher tariff rates continue to creep up, stagflation and even a recession become likelier, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told NBC News last week.",
      "\u201cI think the economic fallout from the tariffs is now obvious: higher inflation and a struggling economy,\u201d he said."

      "France\u2019s biggest wildfire in years was spreading quickly Wednesday in a Mediterranean region near Spain after leaving one person dead and several injured, authorities said. The fire burned an area larger than Paris, and the military was called in to help.",
      "French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou deplored a \u201cdisaster on an unprecedented scale\u201d in the region.",
      "Over 2,100 firefighters and several water bomber aircraft battled the blaze that broke out Tuesday afternoon in the village of Ribaute in the Aude region, a rural, wooded area that is home to wineries.",
      "The fire, which has burned 39,500 acres, remained \u201cvery active\u201d on Wednesday and continued to progress as night fell, the local administration said. The weather was hot, dry and windy, making it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze.",
      "Villagers sought to help douse the flames or save their homes and small businesses, and described their alarm at the fire\u2019s speed. Ash filled the air and coated windows and cars, and several roads were closed around the region.",
      "\u201cThe sky was blue, and then less than an hour later the sky was orange,\u201d said Andy Pickup of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, at the heart of the fire zone. \u201cThat\u2019s when we went out and tried to help.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe heard pops and cracks \u2014 it was the trees, it was the village,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cWe could see the fires taking hold on all the hills around Saint-Laurent.\u201d At dusk, he said, they saw fires in every direction, some as near as 100 yards away.",
      "Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the military will reinforce efforts starting from Thursday, with several dozen soldiers to be deployed.",
      "One person died in their home, and at least 13 others were injured, including 11 firefighters, local authorities said. Three people were missing, the prefecture said.",
      "Jacques Piraux, mayor of the village of Jonqui\u00e8res, said all residents have been evacuated.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scene of sadness and desolation,\u201d he told broadcaster BFM TV after visiting there on Wednesday morning. \u201cIt looks like a lunar landscape, everything is burned. More than half or three-quarters of the village has burned down. It\u2019s hellish.\u201d",
      "Residents and tourists in nearby areas were requested to remain in their homes unless told to evacuate. Two campgrounds were evacuated as a precaution.",
      "The prime minister met Wednesday afternoon with firefighters and residents at Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, where the fire service\u2019s command post has been set up. He said he came to express \u201cnational solidarity.\u201d",
      "The area\u2019s economy is relying on winery and tourism and \u201cboth sectors are affected,\u201d he stressed.",
      "Bayrou said an investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the fire.",
      "The environment ministry said the Aude region has been experiencing a drought this month, with water use restrictions in place. Lack of rainfall in recent months \u201cplayed a major role in the spreading of the fire, since the vegetation is very dry,\u201d the statement said.",
      "This week\u2019s fire was the biggest since the creation of a national fire database in 2006, according to the national emergency service.",
      "Southern Europe has seen multiple large fires this summer. Scientists warn that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires. Last month, a wildfire that reached the southern port of Marseille, France\u2019s second-largest city, left around 300 people injured.",

      "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers have \u201cweaponized\u201d the legal and judicial system to oppress women and girls in what amounts to \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d the independent U.N. investigator on human rights in the country said.",
      "Richard Bennett said in a report to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Wednesday that after seizing power in 2021 the Taliban suspended the 2004 constitution and laws protecting the rights of women and girls. These include a landmark law that criminalized 22 forms of violence against women, including rape and child and forced marriage.",
      "The Taliban dismissed all judges under the previous U.S.-backed government, including approximately 270 women, replacing them with men who share their extreme Islamic views, lack legal training and hand down decisions based on edicts issued by the Taliban, he said.",
      "In addition, he noted that the Taliban have assumed full control over law enforcement and investigative agencies, systematically purging Afghans who worked for the previous government.",
      "Bennett, who was appointed by the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council, focused on access to justice and protection for women and girls in his report. He said he held meetings, focus-group discussions and one-on-one interviews with more that 110 Afghans inside and outside the country. He did so remotely because the Taliban have refused to grant him a visa to travel to Afghanistan.",
      "Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, their crackdown on women and girls has been widely reported and globally denounced.",
      "Taliban leaders have barred education for women and girls beyond sixth grade, banned most employment, and prohibited women from many public spaces, including parks, gyms and hairdressers. New laws ban women\u2019s voices and bare faces outside the home.",
      "The Taliban remain isolated from the West because of their restrictions on women and girls and have only been recognized by Russia.",
      "Bennett said the Taliban did not respond to an advance copy of the report and a request for information about their efforts to ensure access to justice and protection for women and girls.",
      "The Taliban defend their approach to justice by claiming they are implementing Islamic sharia law, but Islamic scholars and others have said their interpretation is unparalleled in other Muslim-majority countries and does not adhere to Islamic teachings. They say protecting the legal rights of women is a priority.",
      "Bennett said, however, that women have virtually no rights.",
      "\u201cToday, there are no women judges or prosecutors and no officially registered female lawyers, leaving women and girls with fewer safe channels to report abuse or seek redress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCoupled with a lack of female officials in the police and other institutions, the result is widespread underreporting of violence and discrimination against women and girls.\u201d",
      "Bennett said access to justice for girls \u201cis further undermined by the dismantling of key legal safeguards and institutions protecting the rights of children,\u201d including juvenile courts and juvenile rehabilitation centers.",
      "The Taliban requirement that a woman must be accompanied by a male relative also creates barriers to filing complaints and attending court proceedings, he said, and disproportionately affects widows, women who are the heads of their households, the displaced and disabled.",
      "\u201cWomen who engage with the Taliban court system \u2014 whether as victims seeking redress, to resolve family issues, to obtain official documents or as alleged offenders \u2014 face a hostile environment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCourts often reject complaints made by women and are especially reluctant to accept cases relating to divorce, child custody and gender-based violence.\u201d",
      "Facing these obstacles, Bennett said, women increasingly turn to traditional and informal justice mechanisms, including formal jirgas and shuras \u2014 community councils of elders \u2014 and informal mediation by religious leaders, community elders or family. But these are all male-dominated and raise \u201cserious concerns about the rights of women and girls,\u201d he said.",
      "He said international forums offer the best hope for justice. He pointed to the International Criminal Court\u2019s request on Jan. 23 for arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders accused of crimes against humanity for persecution \u201con gender grounds.\u201d And he urged all countries to support efforts to bring Afghanistan before the International Court of Justice, the U.N.\u2019s highest tribunal, for violating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."

      "Chicken, rabbits and guinea pigs would be welcome as food for its meat-eaters, the post said.",

      "Zoos have a \u201cresponsibility to imitate the natural food chain\u201d for carnivores that need whole prey for a hunting experience similar to that in the wild, the post said.",
      "\u201cIf you have a healthy animal that has to leave here for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,\u201d it added. \u201cWe ensure natural behavior, nutrition and well-being of our predators.\u201d",
      "The post quickly sparked online debate drawing criticism from some quarters.",
      "\u201cThe idea that a zoo, of all places, is encouraging people to drop off their animals to be killed and fed to lions and tigers is, to me, incredibly disturbing,\u201d one user wrote on Facebook.",
      "Aalborg Zoo has been feeding its carnivores smaller livestock for many years, deputy director Pia Nielsen said, \u201cto give them as natural a diet as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cTherefore, it makes sense to allow animals that need to be euthanized for various reasons to be of use in this way,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIn Denmark, this practice is common, and many of our guests and partners appreciate the opportunity to contribute.\u201d",
      "In an update to its original post Tuesday, the zoo said it had closed the comments section.",
      "\u201cWe understand that the post arouses emotions and interest, but hateful and malicious rhetoric is not necessary \u2014 and we encourage everyone to maintain a respectful tone,\u201d the zoo wrote.",
      "It is not unheard of for animals to be fed to predators after they have died in a zoo or culled from healthy animal populations.",
      "In 2014, Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark's capital courted controversy when it killed an 18-month-old giraffe called Marius with a bolt gun and fed him to the lions, saying the animal was \u201cunwanted.\u201d",

It agreed to the move after securing assurances that the U.S. will prioritize the delivery of new Patriots to Germany to backfill its stocks. These weapon systems are only made in the U.S.",
      "As an organization, NATO provides only non-lethal assistance to Ukraine like uniforms, tents, medical supplies and logistics support. The 32-nation military alliance has mostly sought to protect NATO territory from possible Russian attack and avoid being dragged into a war against a nuclear power.",
      "But its support role has expanded since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, even as his administration insists European allies must now take care of their own security and that of their war-ravaged neighbor. Trump has made no public promise of weapons or economic support for Ukraine.",
      "Trump said on July 28 that the U.S. is \u201cgoing to be sending now military equipment and other equipment to NATO, and they\u2019ll be doing what they want, but I guess it\u2019s for the most part working with Ukraine.\u201d"

Expect further steps.\u201d",
